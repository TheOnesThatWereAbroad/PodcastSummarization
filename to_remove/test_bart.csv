"Hello. Hello. Hello everyone. This is Katie and we are here together on our first ever episode of cream in your coffee. Thank you so much guys for humoring me on this podcast Journey. It's been a huge goal of mine for the past few years. I finally just growing a pair and jumping right into it and seeing how it goes. So, thank you again for bearing with me here.  Alrighty guys, so I figured for the first episode why not jump into a topic that is so exciting for pretty much everybody out there just around the corner and seven or eight days. We have the wonderful Christmas and I'm so excited Christmas is a great time of year for me. I just love the spirit of happiness and joy and the giving spirit. I love every single part of it and I hope that you guys are excited for it to obviously it would definitely  I say that most people are I find most excited about receiving gifts around Christmas time. I'm definitely the opposite I get really really awkward when someone gives me a gift but I get so excited to give someone else a gift and just to see their faces when they open it. I'd like to think that I'm pretty good with gifts. I usually think of something like thoughtful or I'll even make something for someone so it really just depends on the person obviously, but I don't know doing something nice for someone always feels good, right?  Anyways, so I wanted to just give a couple tips for you guys because I did work retail for several years of my life and I'm honestly very very happy that I am not this year because I hate crowds and even though I work with people I kind of hate people. So seeing frantic men and women running all over the mall trying to figure out what to buy their loved ones for a holiday. That's like usually two days away is a little stressful for me, but this year I don't have to worry about  But thank goodness.  So my first tip for you guys is going to seem probably unhelpful right this minute, but in future Christmases to come it's going to save you big ","On the first ever episode of Kream in your Koffee, Katie talks about tips for Christmas shopping.

"We are 30 something's living in a city showing what it means to live Chastity the Catholic faith and friendship. I'm Mary. I'm Lizzie. I'm Abigail and I man and this is Chad City and the city Modern Catholic women living city lies. So grab a cosmo or a cup of tea and join the conversation.  Hi everyone, and thank you for joining another conversation with us. Today's topic is one that I knew very little about until the last few years and the more I learned about it the more I realize it's like what God has intended for us and our bodies and that is Chastity Chastity is something that I think a lot of people have misconceptions about eyes.  Only was one of those people and I've actually made myself a little bit of a student about it because I didn't know that much and I feel like I'm excited to have this conversation with Abigail and in Lizzie because I don't think these conversations are have enough and I want to learn from these ladies as much as I want to share my experience. Yeah. So before we get started, I just think that  we should go ahead and read the definition of Chastity that is provided by the catechism of the Catholic church. And for those of you who would like to look this up. It is number 2 3 3 7 paragraph 2 3 3 7 in the catechism of the Catholic church, and it says Chastity means the successful integration of sexuality within the person and thus the inner Unity of man and his bodily and spiritual being  Sexuality in which man's belonging to the bodily and biological world is expressed becomes personal and truly human when it is integrated into the relationship of one person to another in the complete and lifelong Mutual gift of a man and a woman the virtue of Chastity. Therefore involves the Integrity of the person and the integrality of the gift. There's a lot more that could be said about that but it but that is the basic definition.  The catechism of the Catholic church, and I think I want to say one of the number one like misconceptions or myths t",In today's episode of Chasity and the City we talk about our Journey with Chasity.   How we live the virtue of Chasity now and misconceptions we had about Chastity before we educated ourselves.   We share some real talk and relatable stories about our journey to living chastely.

"Let's discuss what the evidence for evolution was the discovery of genes as a mechanism to inherent characteristics and create variance supported the theory of evolution. There are also two other main sources of evidence which were fossils fossils show. The gradual changes in organisms are vast periods of time.  And the other source of evidence is antibiotic resistant material natural selection. Neatly explains this phenomenon because bacteria reproduce rapidly mutations can occur during reproduction. And if the mutated bacteria is resistant to antibiotics, it will survive exposure to the antibiotics and go on to reproduce and this bacterium will represent the original ancestor of a new resistant strain. They have evolved by natural selection.   What also Souls fossils are the remains of traces of ancient life they're finding rocks, and I've been preserved by natural processes and there are three different ways of forming fossils.  One is Preservation when Decay is not possible where decomposers cannot act preservation is possible. So for example decomposers cannot operate in glaciers because this is an extreme environment with very low temperatures. So enzyme action doesn't really work and also in pink box which are very acidic. So the pH is too low.  Another method of forming a fossil is the hardening of soft materials the hardness of materials can produce casts or Impressions such as footprints, for example clay hardens around an organism that is buried within it this organism then decays leaving behind the cast of itself.  Another one is mineral replacement hard parts of organisms are gradually replaced by minerals as they Decay slowly creating a rock-like substance when the surrounding sediment turns to rock the t-shaped mineral structure remains distinct.
