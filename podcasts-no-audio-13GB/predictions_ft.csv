Below is a short segment from the episode.
""I am very happy for Gamepigeon‚Äôs existence and think it is a very good business idea.
The way it was built has made it popular and regularly-played, and I give lots of credit to the company for making this a trend.
Even though I play the same games a lot, taking the bus and texting friends on the weekend has kept me coming back to play more and more.
The pros certainly outweigh the cons, and the biggest problem I had was that the game was too addicting, which is actually a good job done by the creators.
I would definitely like to continue playing Game"

"In this episode, we discuss the differences between the Auckland and Small Town Property Yields (Gross Yield) on two different types of properties.
We look at the gross yield on the Auckland property is 4.5% and the Small Town property is 8.3%.
This means that over the next 10 years, the Auckland Property will earn you about $20,000 per year, while the small town property is going to earn you $730 per year.","In this episode, we discuss another difference between investing in small towns and larger cities ‚Äì deferred capital maintenance.
Every investor accepts (and hopefully budgets for) the fact that their properties will require maintenance throughout the year.
However, we also know that from time to time investment properties will require capital maintenance, especially if the property is older.
This could be the replacement of a roof, painting the outside of the property, rewiring the house, or some other major works.
These are often not budgeted for and the payment for these works are often made by leveraging the property.
But, the cost of this maintenance is more expensive (as a proportion of the house price) for properties in smaller towns than in large cities.
That means that a small-town property that appears to be cashflow positive can actually have a poor cashflow once this capital maintenance is factored in.
We also mention the Property Investors Quiz, this 7-question quiz will give you a 'yes', 'no', or'maybe', answer as to whether you are in a position to invest in property right now."
"In this episode, we discuss gross rental yields in Parnell, Auckland.
This is a suburb that is not likely to be a good investment option for an investor, given that the median gross rental yield in the suburb is negative 1 point 3%.
In fact, even before accounting for all of the costs associated with owning a property, you are well in the red before you factor in all of your operational costs.","In this episode, we discuss that you shouldn't always believe the data you read... or rather that you should take the time to read into it more.
This is based on an article Ed provided comment on for Westpac.
They wrote an article that suggested that gross yields for 1-bedroom apartments in Parnell were about x2 that of 3-bedroom homes.
We discuss when you should read into more data and what actually lies behind this story.

We chat about her career, her training, her injuries and how she has managed to run her way to the top of the world in the last few years.","This week on the Endure Stronger podcast, we interview double Olympian and European silver medallist Eilish McColgan.
Eilish is a Scottish middle distance runner who represented Team GB at the 2012 and the 2016 Olympic Games and is on track to represent Great Britain again this summer in Tokyo.
We talk with Eilish about her goals for 2020, her biggest inspiration, overcoming injuries, and how she deals with pre-race nerves - and how you can too.
(Eilish is a good person to take advice from about this.
She went from competing at the *relatively* small Scottish University championships straight to the London Olympics at the age of twenty.)
Eilish also recounts how early in her career, she overcame an injury so bad that one doctor mistook it for a motorcycle accident and told her she wouldn‚Äôt run at an elite level again.
We also discuss the troubles females athletes face and the scrutiny in the mainstream media, which lead to a refreshingly honest chat about body shaming.
Eilish also tells us about her biggest inspiration - her mum and coach, former world champion Liz McColgan.

Evan is a professor of art at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities, a writer, and an avid art lover who has been in the art community for a long time.","As part of our 3-part Radio Juxtapoz special at The Armory Show 2020, we sit down with Philadelphia-based fine artist and teacher, Mark Thomas Gibson.
We first became aware of Mark's biting and often slyly humorous looks at both contemporary life and American history through a comic book aesthetic, frame-by-frame stories in fine art form.
Born in South Florida with a post-graduate degree at Yale (where he was also an instructor before moving to Philly to work at Temple), Gibson's work is so perfectly stated by M+B Gallery: Gibson's painting ""stems from his multipartite viewpoint as an artist‚Äîas a black male, a professor, an American history buff and comic book aficionado.""
On the occasion of our series at The Armory Show in NYC, Radio Juxtapoz sat down with Mark Thomas Gibson on an early morning before the fair doors opened to talk about his solo booth with M+B, the changing dynamics of not only his work but the overall landscape of contemporary art and how the comic book was his first love.
The Radio Juxtapoz podcast is hosted by FIFTH WALL TV's Doug Gillen and Juxtapoz editor, Evan Pricco.

If you are in the grips of a ranging anxiety disorder - finding it near impossible to STOP thinking about how you feel all the time - it's OK to reject this advice.
While in the grips of raging disorders like OCD, health anxiety, panic disorder, and agoraphobia, specifically making time to focus inward on how one is feeling is like pouring gasoline on a fire.
A person that is desperate to STOP paying constant attention to how they feel and what they think does not need to turn inward to see what they need.
What they need is to stop focusing inward.

"In this episode I talk about my journey with Agoraphobia and learned helplessness.
How I learned to push myself out of my comfort zone and into something new and how it has changed my life.","Learned helplessness is a condition where a person suffers from a sense of feeling powerless.
It usually comes from a traumatic event or series of traumatic events or persistent failure to succeed.
It's one of the biggest underlying causes of depression.
When you grow up with abuse and trauma, you learn helplessness, and it becomes an identity for you, its the equivalent to being locked in an emotional prison cell.
When you grow up, and you move out on your own, nobody is guarding you, the cell door is not locked, and you can walk out at any time, but you can't do it.
You have been conditioned to be helpless.
We've become unwilling to walk away from the pain.
We accept it as our reality.
That's why so many of us get stuck in life and can't move forward.
It's like we're in this endless loop, where we sit in pain, and we don't know how to get out of it.
It becomes our identity, and it becomes our way of life.

Most of us believe that forgiveness is an outward act that requires you to be okay with what the other person did to you.

Forgiveness is an internal shift in awareness and energy within yourself.
It‚Äôs the ability to shift the story you tell yourself about the other person, and your relationship to the event.
In this episode we discuss:   How forgiveness work is a constant process, not something you do once.
Victim mindset, and how it keeps a lot of us stuck in resentment and an unwillingness to forgive.
How an unwillingness to forgive and hold grudges is actually harming YOU, not the other person.
How taking responsibility for your forgiveness work will increase your sense of agency over your life.
Two life coaches expert tips on how you can begin to forgive even those who have hurt you the most, and why this is so important to your overall health and well-being.

"Cold showers have been around for thousands of years.
They are a great way to get rid of inflammation, increase neurotransmitters, reduce inflammation, and improve your overall well-being!","Take the Free Keto Mini-Course: bit.ly/KetoMiniCourse¬† Intermittent Fasting Basics: bit.ly/DrBergIF¬†  Today we‚Äôre going to talk about the benefits of taking a cold shower.
Why take cold showers?
It all has to do with something called cryotherapy or cold therapy.
This concept is based on hormesis.
With hormesis, what you‚Äôre doing is adding a moderate amount of stress to create a beneficial effect.
By taking a 20 minute cold shower, you can increase norepinephrine by 200-300%.
When you increase this nerve transmitter, you can: ¬†‚Ä¢ Drop inflammation ¬†‚Ä¢ Increase your antioxidant network (including glutathione) ¬†‚Ä¢ Increase your mitochondria¬† ¬†‚Ä¢ Increase your T-cells  How to take cold showers to get these cold shower benefits: Start out with maybe 30 seconds or a minute, and gradually increase the time you‚Äôre in the cold shower over time.
7 cold shower benefits: 1.
Decrease muscle pain 2.
Decrease joint pain 3.
Speed up recovery¬† 4.
Decrease inflammation 5.
Increase cognitive function 6.
Increase mood 7.
Increase metabolism¬†  Dr."

What does it mean that Jesus was transfigured in glory?
And what does it tell us about his identity and mission in the kingdom?","Matthew 17: 1-9 - 'His face shone like the sun.'
CCC Passages: - 554 (in 'A Foretaste of the Kingdom - The Transfiguration') - From the day Peter confessed that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God, the Master ""began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things... and be killed, and on the third day be raised.""
Peter scorns this prediction, nor do the others understand it any better than he.
In this context the mysterious episode of Jesus' Transfiguration takes place on a high mountain, before three witnesses chosen by himself: Peter, James and John.
Jesus' face and clothes become dazzling with light, and Moses and Elijah appear, speaking ""of his departure, which he was to accomplish at Jerusalem"".
A cloud covers him and a voice from heaven says: ""This is my Son, my Chosen; listen to him!""

He extends the commandment of love, which is that of the New Law, to all enemies.
Liberation in the spirit of the Gospel is incompatible with hatred of one's enemy as a person, but not with hatred of the evil that he does as an enemy.
- 2842 (in 'The Seven Petitions') - You, therefore, must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect""; ""Be merciful, even as your Father is merciful""...It is impossible to keep the Lord's commandment by imitating the divine model from outside; there has to be a vital participation, coming from the depths of the heart, in the holiness and the mercy and the love of our God.

Waking Life,¬†by Richard Linklater, is a movie that tells the story of a young man who keeps realizing he‚Äôs in¬†a dream, inside of endless other dreams, having philosophical conversations with distinct individuals about the meaning of life, consciousness, the nature of reality, etc.
One of the central questions of the movie is: How can we really know we aren‚Äôt just stuck in a perpetual dream?
How can we make sure we are waking?
This said, Waking Youth is a bi-weekly podcast that aims to inspire you and me to make sure we aren't sleepwalking through our waking state.
Assuming, of course, that the life we consider our waking life isn't merely a dream (but I will hopefully leave such discussion to a whole other episode).
I invite several young students and professionals to deconstruct how they make sure they are questioning reality, building the life of their dreams, and living up to their fullest creative potential.

We also talk about the new AGM 35mm f1.25 and the new Night Vision 40mm f2.8.","Once again, The Late Night Vision Show is back with another topic that was derived from listener questions.
One of the subjects we repeated get asked about is thermal clip-on optics.
There are many misconceptions, misunderstandings and even myths surrounding clip-ons and on this episode Hans and Jason tackle this subject head on and in their down to earth, logical fashion, they weigh in with their opinions based on their years of experience with thermal and night vision hunting optics.
