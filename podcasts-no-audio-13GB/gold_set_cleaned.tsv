spotify:episode:4KRC1TZ28FavN3J5zLHEtQ	 What's up fellas? So I got a patron supported that wanted me to talk about passive aggressive women like this is a category of women. All right, guys all women a passive-aggressive. All right guys, when a woman won't set a date with you or you know tell you will see or she cancels a date. That's a woman being passed. Aggressive guys, that's a woman that didn't know how to tell you directly. I'm not interested. All right guys now as y'all guys might know sometimes maybe she did have a little bit of interest but you just did some just went on a kilt that but a lot of times they don't even be that guys when you go up and get some of these women normal guys. They don't want to be confrontational. They know that a rejection is basically a woman's way of saying you're not good enough for me and I'm a  I tell you guys why.  Women are never off the market. Even if she's married if when you go up and you meet a woman if you are higher value than the man she got at home and what I mean by high value, I mean whatever she values some women are into pretty boys. Some women are into money. Some women are into Charisma more all women are into some of them to some degree, but some women just  Are you a man? That's smooth as fuck and some women are just into primarily into looks and some women as y'all guys might know are all about the dollar. So and let me tell you guys like what I mean by that if you are dating a woman and she's with you cuz you are better men provider. That's what she's seeking. She wants a man that's about two dollars that look out for her and a billionaire comes up and approached her and she knows he's a billionaire.  Yo chick gonna be gone not that day. Not that day because she got to see what he's about. She gots to see his is he he just want to fuck one time. But if he won't show job, he will have your fucking job. Alright guys. So now she won't leave you that day. She got to see what this motherfucker maybe you only want to ask one time. But if he show us some consistency and she and he shows that he want to be her man. She gonna leave your ass it just that if a woman is into Luke's and  Meet a guys that's in her eyes more attractive than you and then after she doesn't talk to him a couple of times on the side. Guess what your chick gonna be going. I got your chick motherfucker. Alright guys, so anytime a woman rejects you what she basically saying is you are not what I'm looking for because there's no such thing as a woman being off the market i period and for any of you guys go jump on your fucking soapbox talking shit if women approached me.  N and you will marry in a hotter chick came up and approach you that was hotter than the chick you got at home your ass or do the same fucking thing. Unfortunately for us women do not approach us. And so therefore if you have a wife at home, unless a woman is choosing extremely hard. You really won't go out your way to talk to no other cheese because you married so fuck it. All right. So that's the thing with that some of you guys still be on. All right, some of you guys are still married, whatever you still.  Young but so all rejection is a woman's passive-aggressive way of turning you down. I'll pay for all you guys who don't know what passive-aggressive mean that means a person is trying to avoid confrontation. They're trying to tell you something without a confrontation. I have this shit with me on the Train sometimes sometimes strangers us this started talking to me on the train about anything and I'm not talking about because they recognize me on YouTube. I'm just talking about people be sitting on the track and then just start talking.  Going about some random shit. And then I take my help ease out. I listen I like. Oh, okay. All right. We all know Spotify as the huge music giant app on Spotify. You can also listen to podcast. They have a huge catalog on every topic including the one you're listening to right now. You can easily share what you're listening to with your friends on Instagram if you haven't done so already  Ready, be sure to download the Spotify app search for alpha male strategies and be sure to follow the podcast. All right, and then I'll put my ear PC because I'm being passive-aggressive. I really want to tell them to shut the fuck up but I don't want to do that. So I'm hoping that they understand me put my earpiece back in my ear lets them know motherfucker. I don't want to talk to you and then you'll see them they'll still be talking and then you take the other piece out and be like, oh, okay. All right, and then you put this  You see this in the gym, sometimes two motherfuckers come up talking to you when you if you go up help to somebody guys and they try to put the earpiece back in. Why are you talking to them? That means shut the fuck up. All right guys, passive-aggressively. All right guys, so women are do all those type of things guys to avoid confrontation to not hurt your feelings or whatever. That's past my girls now in a relationship a woman does different type of passive aggressive. All right.  A woman pulls back. All right, if you're dating a woman she pulls back that's passive aggressive guys. That's not done indirectly. All right, some of us men do it too when we started like when you hit the as a few times to minute well before you was, you know, texting her and ask her out and shit now, you ain't doing it you pulling back a little bit you hoping she get the hint. All right, a pullback is a passive-aggressive way of letting the person know I'm losing fucking interest now. Sometimes it's done hoping that the person  You know taste a shit up because they ain't on point and sometimes it's done cause you really tired of motherfucking and you want them to get the hand get the fuck on. Alright guys. So if you date a woman she passive-aggressive if you laying in bed with a woman and you live with her and she sleeps with her back turned to you guys that's passive aggressive and letting you know that I'm losing interest. Oh, I ain't got much issues in you right now all that's passive aggressive guys. Now, there's levels to passive-aggressive.  First a woman is passive aggressive. That means she pulls back. She does things to show you that she's losing interest that's passive aggressive guys. All right silent treatment all this shit all that's done passive-aggressive if you don't pick up on it, or if you pick up on it, and you start acting insecure about it. That's when the masculine energy comes. Alright, so first a woman is passive aggressive. She pulls back she tries to dusting to let you know she's losing interest the  Great way to handle it is for you to pull back and get on your fucking purpose and shit like that and let her come back to you. All right, that's the correct way of doing it. But if you didn't do it that way you start acting insecure or accuse her of cheating and shit like that. That's when the masculine energy comes. All right that lets you know that it's really low. Alright guys, so that's all that is what that passive aggressive guys. Is that that's just a way of woman lets, you know, all women are passing. There's no such thing as talk about passengers you be at basically a  Asking me to talk about 4 billion women because all women are passive aggressive and when a woman won't typically if a woman is being passive-aggressive and she wants you to make some changes to where she really cares about you and she wants you to make some changes. She used it'll do us in a passive-aggressive match message on social media Facebook or some shit like that that you are. No she's talking about you but the and everybody else would know she talking about you.  But she really wants some change and she's also playing the victim card. All right, that way she's letting everybody know look at the sorry piece of shit that I got at home. Alright guys, so that's the thing with that guys. So just pay attention. All passive-aggressive is a woman losing interest. All right, and all women are passive aggressive. It's a feminine trait, but we men also have it too sometimes sometimes I am comfor tation. I'll let you know. All right, and sometimes I'm not all right men and women both carry trace a masculine and  Feminine energy. Obviously, we care more masculine than women, but we still some of us guys are passive aggressive to guys. All right, so that's the situation with that and I had another Patron supported. I wanted me to talk about being mentally strong. All right guys, mentally being mentally strong guy comes from going through trials and tribulations and when you go through those trials and tribulations, it's not about crying while you were at the bottom. It's about figure it out.  How can you be better next time what got you in this position? Like when you see basketball players football players and shit, like let's let's think back to the Chicago Bulls or the 90s right when the Pistons will be Nee ass in the late 80s early 90s, right right before the Bulls won their first championship. All right, when the Piston will be named as what they did each season in the you guys know each season. They push them closer and closer to they finally beat them so they was learning from them.  Mistakes see that's the thing about being mentally strong. You have to learn from your mistakes. All right, when I first joined on YouTube and you know David Koechner was taking shots at me and shit. I show week mental strength because I would lash out and respond back to it. All right. And when this after I came to Patron and I went back I learned something from that II like I said, man, you know, what can we do?  Because this ain't going on. Well, alright, if you going to be on YouTube and you're going to be getting the views that you getting and they getting the views that they getting well jealousy is going to come with that. So, how are you going to handle that? Are you going to stay here and have a Jocelyn match with these motherfuckers going backwards and for all right, or are you going to learn from what you did last time guys? Come on here all the time. Hey, did you see such made that video about UAMS you need to respond.  I ain't responding to shit. All right, guys, that's what I learned from that I don't even watch guys. Come over here not letting me know all these guys people making reaction videos about me. I don't even watch the reaction videos about me period I made a video about Derek Jackson and somebody told me he was funded to a comment and go check it out. And then that come in. He said I ain't seen the video and I'm not going to  Watch the video and that is precisely how you handle the guys when people like me being on YouTube and shit. What I learned is, you know, not only do you not respond. Do not even watch it. I don't care if they make a hundred reaction videos to me. I don't watch one of them. All right, that's the thing with that guys. So the thing about being mentally strong is that usually means that you had a low point if you're being mentally strong that means you're at a low point now,  You got to look at what can I do to come back stronger and better next time when I was at the gym?  In a client would not want to rehire me to train them when they will come through an a you know, you know money's a little tight right now, which is bullshit. I don't see you fucking moving out of fucking Manhattan. I see you still paying that six grand a month for rent. So ain't no fucking financial problems. You just don't want me to try. Well, I learned to be a what I took from that EOS. I need to become a better trainer surely enough. I started hearing that less and less and less take the very end when I was training.  I had lost a client and over two years guys over two years. All right guys that because I seen that I'm losing clients. I felt like it was something that I was not giving the clients and instead of mibu and and crying and want to quit what I took from that is I needed to enhance my skills. All right guys, so being mentally strong is not about suck it up and be a man being mentally strongest taking something from the lesson taking something from that ass-whooping you.  Eating right now and coming back stronger next time. Alright guys as I get bigger and bigger than your own on YouTube and shit like that. You're gonna see more reaction videos. You don't seem oh hey and guess what? You ain't gonna get out of me. You ain't gonna get not one responds you be talking to your motherfucking self. I wouldn't give a fuck if somebody showed y'all a picture of me fucking a pig and five years old. I ain't get a missile got to respond to this. They got your father to paint you you gotta respond. It ain't responding to  Shit, believe what you wanna believe? I don't give a fuck if they got a picture of me being a 90 year old lady up. Well Kane Ain't responding to shit. Believe what you wanna believe. I'm not responding to Jack. All right guys, that's what I fucking lurk about it. Alright guys. So if you if somebody is hating on you in your unless it's being disrespectful.  Just ignore it. All right, if somebody being disrespectful they hate on you and your face. Oh, you need to check the ass. But if somebody just hating from afar let they ass hate for my father. Somebody come telling you some other fucking say it behind your back man. Listen, you know what I would tell them up like that man. I don't even want to hear I don't care what they say it. They said my fucking face. That's why would somebody come try to tell me something if somebody on my YouTube Channel right now right now comes on my channel and try to tell me somebody say  Some about me on my YouTube. I block them for being messy for being a little bitch. I blocked the ass trying to bring Miss to me. Hey, it'll Miss Southern such channels that I never even fucking heard of and I blocked the ass for being a little bitch. All right, I don't block them for relaying the message. I blocked him from being a bitch. That's what I blocking for. I don't even want to hear it. Alright guys, so that's how you become mentally strong guys when you go through something.  Take a lesson from that as in what can I do different next time? How did I get myself in this situation? All right guys and learn from it. Alright. Alright guys, so that's the situation with that like the video comment down below what you guys want to see next. Holler back.	All right guys now as y'all guys might know sometimes maybe she did have a little bit of interest but you just did some just went on a kilt that but a lot of times they don't even be that guys when you go up and get some of these women normal guys.  Alright guys, so anytime a woman rejects you what she basically saying is you are not what I'm looking for because there's no such thing as a woman being off the market i period and for any of you guys go jump on your fucking soapbox talking shit if women approached me.
spotify:episode:4tdDQcsBOUVWnA9XrpgTzS	If you are bored you are boring.  One of my kids made a mistake of one time saying Dad. I'm bored, which I replied. Well, that's because you're boring so stop being so boring. It was the first and last time I ever said that  you are not meant to live a boring life. You were meant to live a life of adventure adventure does not mean that you can afford some fancy Instagram mobile vacation Adventure is a mindset. It is a way of looking at the world. It is observing the Wonder all around us.  Interesting people are interested in people. Most people miss the Wonder all around because they never learn to observe the Wonder around them the minute that they're not entertained. They reach for their phone and level up their virtual Avatar. They work harder on this imaginary character than living a legendary life.  I wonder what happens to a world that grows up being handed a smartphone or tablet every time they can't sit still Silence has become awkward a generation ago silence was considered peaceful. When is the last time you sat in silence? God doesn't always speak in the thunder in the earthquake.  The answer usually comes in the form of a whisper today approach the world with a sense of childlike wonder and you will never be bored a day in your life.  Delete the apps that delete your destiny because the fate of the world rests in your dreams not in your distractions, and I hope the day has a good you.

Delete the apps that delete your destiny because the fate of the world rests in your dreams not in your distractions, and I hope the day has a good you.

spotify:episode:6AUFl7KQWN6pzGFEIEKFQu	So so and salutations Summers and welcome to the simmers digest podcast a companion to the simmers Digest Magazine. I am technobabble your host on this audio exploration guiding you through the vast and fantastic community that makes up the Sims hoping to help you discover some  One new learn a little bit more about some of your favorite creators and highlight all of the amazing people who make up our community.  So you may be asking yourselves. Why start a podcast technobabble and I will tell you I have always been fascinated with podcasts and I thought it would be fun to create a sims based podcast. I went out searching for a Sims based podcasts and everyone I came across was either no longer in production or only had a couple episodes and since one of the main goals of the simmers Digest Magazine.  Is to help support all simmers. I thought this would be a great venue for me to merge my passion of the Sims and curiosity about podcasting into one fantastic place to help support and chili light more community members and simmers. So sit back turn your volume up to 11 and let's get ready for the very first episode of Consumers Digest podcast. It's  Means that now would be as good as time as any to introduce myself to all and give you a brief bit of History. I am technobabble. I have been hooked on the Sims ever since the original game when I was introduced to it while visiting my brother when he was in college. He had a copy of the game and let me play it on his desktop while my parents looked over his dorm room and chat it before we went out to eat from that moment on I was hooked for Christmas that same Year. My brother made me a  bootleg copy of the game that quickly blossomed into me saving all of my money to invest in each new expansion pack as they came out. I had to have them all. I spent much of my youth exploring and creating worlds wrapped around the making magic expansion pack. I loved playing the game creating both buildings homes families stories and even entire worlds as time progressed and the new Sims 2 came out I upgraded and played loads with custom.  Content and thoroughly bort my game a few times when Sims 3 came out. I was excited to start a new and try my best not to overwhelm. My desperately underpowered machine at the time fast forward to today and here I am an advocate Sims 4 player. I own many of the extras, you know game pack stuff packs etcetera, but not all of them. I play all of my games CC free mainly due to the nightmare I lived.  When I bought my Sims 2 out of existence and I even host my very own YouTube channel with loads of LPS a few build videos and a handful of criticisms videos. So, how did I get here making a podcast about the amazing community members that make up the Sims?  As I mentioned before I have had a fascination with podcasts for some time and the tools are now available that allow me to create a podcast with limited knowledge and with limited resources.  My passion for The Sims 4 Grew From consuming copious amounts of hours of YouTube to creating my own YouTube channel to showcasing a weekly watch athon on my Twitter account to realizing that I wanted to give more back to the community that I love so much Ergo the simmers Digest Magazine was created and from that a Twitter account a Tumblr and so much more leading right to this here podcast.  Now that you know a little bit about me, how about I introduce you to the format of the show and a little bit more of what to expect each week. Now I am of course perpetually looking for ways to improve the work I start. So please bear with me as I attempt to piece together a podcast highlighting Summers Creations ranging from builds to videos similar features to Gallery walks and more.

It only seems fitting to walk you through a few more introductions mainly to the format of the podcast and what you can expect to get here my tentative plans for the first few episodes are to share with you some of the highlights and events that take place within the digital pages of the Flipboard magazine and Tumblr. Mainly I'm looking to introduce you to new simmers their videos streams galleries, etcetera the form  The show will follow each week. I hope a simmer feature. Let's watch series Gallery pick of the week News interviews, and of course a whole lot of wiggle room to learn and develop a podcast that you will hopefully enjoy. So what are each of these items and how do they pertain to you? Well for one, the simmer feature is an interactive space. I put together and share via Twitter which highlights a simmer introducing you to either a brand-new person to check out or even possibly  lighting you my goal with this feature is to share your awesomeness with the world whether you be a streamer YouTuber or even just someone who enhances the community via other means  The let's watch series is a series. I started on the simmers digest Tumblr and is much like a book club, but instead of reading books and talking about it. We collectively go and view a simmers YouTube channel pick out a handful of videos to watch and watch them leave comments and share the link to their channels on our own social medias.  Many people have shared how absolutely fantastic. This series is for discovering new simmers or a series from a favorite simmer that they've not yet come across on the flip side. The simmer Who series is featured has seen their views and comments go up on the selected videos that were checking out. The goal here is to create a positive experience for both the viewer and the Creator and help share each other's amazing Creations Gallery Pixar something new to me. I know that there are so many creators in our community who do not post videos.  Host live streams on their of their creations and that's totally okay. So I thought that a gallery pick of the week would be a fun way to put the spotlight on a builder or cast Creator from our gallery.  If there is some news I am certain that I will not be the first person to share it but I do like talking about the Sims and sharing any updates. I'm hearing or reading about from other amazing Sims news outlets. Like lama news The Sims Community page and a plethora of tweets from the Fantastic some gurus. So if I hear about something I will share it here as well as edit to the digital magazine.  As far as interviews go. I am looking to entertain something new with this podcast. I'm hoping to be able to have some recorded interviews of myself and simmers here on the podcast. Occasionally. I may just have to read off an interview that I've had with a simmer with their permission, of course via Twitter or other social networks, but I think it'd be super fun for you as well as me to host them here on the podcast and give us a chance to get to know more members of our amazing Community. I hope that this first episode of  Reductions has at least piqued your interest. If so, be sure to subscribe to the podcast via your favorite pod catching app just search for simmers digest.

Hello and welcome back to nothing. But a bob thing I am Justin The Fierce and he is Justin. I'm Nathan the brave. Yeah, I mean you're brave in your own way. I mean, I think you're brave enough. I get out of the house every day. That's pretty brave. If I say so but you put your pants on one leg at a time just like everybody know I'm brave. I put I put my pants on two legs at a time. You've got a wire. Suspended I jump in time to jump into my pants evidence out of your bed. It takes 10 to 15 tries.  But I eventually nailed it. What a way to start the day. Hmm. That's why you don't have to drink coffee. You've already fallen. It's yeah, I mean, I may have a concussion by the time I get to work but my pants were on and that's what matters dr. S you so how did you get the concussion you play a contact sport? Yes. Oh tonight friends. We are going to be journeying down a lazy river, but  For that it is traditional on the show to have some sort of little factoid about Bob in this case today. We have a bob news story who's Bob news Bob news, but new All Rise. So I think we can all agree that the late Bob Ross has really not gotten the respect. He deserves in the art community. Yes.  Weather whether you really like what he makes or not.  He is a very influential art figure indeed and he deserves some recognition. I think we on this show were championing that in our own small way. Well, let me tell you Bob Ross is finally having some paintings featured in the museum exhibition. You're kidding. It's taken him being dead 24 years to finally get done.  Wow, but the DePaul Art Museum. Okay, Chicago. Oh wow is having an exhibition called New Age strategies for survival. Ooh, I like that. Wow. So for of his landscape paintings, which represent self-care in the New Age movement. Yeah are included in the exhibition. That is excellent. Yeah. So do you think of price of a bob painting just shot way up?  I mean, I would assume so once you get featured in a museum or recognized yeah, which is it's ludicrous that hasn't happened so far. I mean good on you too. Paul Museum this a which which ones which pieces it doesn't say. Okay. Well, we'll have to keep following this story. I'd be really curious to know. So this is his official Museum debut. Okay, his work has once been loaned out to the Lyndon B Johnson Presidential Library  Okay, not really. Yeah an art museum per se right, right. I mean to be fair. I haven't been to the Lyndon B Johnson Presidential Library. Maybe it's full of great art. Are we to suppose then that Lyndon B Johnson was a fan but Bob Ross and The Joy of Painting. I mean, I guess I would like to know that it would be really random if  if Lyndon B Johnson just didn't care about Bob Ross. Yeah. Anyway, I did stick. There's just one guy who's like, you know, it'd be awesome. Bob Ross. Did London like it? Yeah, but Bob I films job like four years ago curating for this this library and man we have had some wild shit up in here man. We're just gonna put Bob floored fucking ceiling every day man and blast of fucking  Fish Man top volume, you know, I'm saying Trey Anastasio man. Fuck I got some cushion the back you want some the Lyndon B Johnson library has the world's largest fish bootleg collections. That's right. No one can prove. I'm wrong in the house employees which are all those people like Park Rangers. Yeah. They probably are see they're like super hippie Park Rangers. I love this idea. So what was the name of the exhibit again at the museum in Chicago?  Chicago new age New Age. Yeah to nuages MMM don't know why: strategies for survival. I like the strategies for survival. That seems I wonder what other artists are going to be in the exhibit to I'm glad you asked. Okay Rashid Johnson not familiar Tony or Isler and Robert Pruitt. We should know these people but we don't because we're not real are. Oh, I know all those people again.  You can't prove it strip. No, but I the the strategies for survival. Yeah, I mean that's kind of been one of the thesis that we've had on this show is that you know, people are turning back to Bob as a way to relax in this crazy world much like ASMR much like the CBD phenomenon. People are just trying to relax. Yeah. It's very very difficult to relax when you're on your screens constantly. Yes.  Listening to Cheeto Hitler. Yeah, you know things like that out off at the mouth. Yeah, I spew. Yeah. I mean there's there's a lot going on. There's a lot of tension. Mmm, and even I mean even the mall soft and vaporwave music, I feel like there's an element of relaxation doll that that one's more confusion painting painting you work with a great deal of Illusions. So in addition to  Our Bob news we just before recording tonight. We just put it out on Twitter to the twitterverse. Hey any questions for us as we record tonight and our good friend Chris on Twitter who listens to both this show and our other shows who jackknife which you're more than welcome to listen to the content varies significantly, it would be very strange if you forbid them from listening to it. You were forbidden. Yeah, Chris a  Asks, I'm not sure if you guys answered this in a past episode. But what is your first memory of Bob Ross? So I'll go first okay because mine is not interested. Okay. I don't have a specific memory. Gotcha. I just remember it being on TV show all the time. Sure my family we didn't have cable. Yeah for most of my life no cable. No satellite anything like that. So we had  ABC Fox CBS NBC PBS right maybe TBM. Yeah, in case you wanted to listen to a preacher quote heal someone or through a dollars on a stage. Yeah. I'm just imagining a strip club Church strip club church. So, you know you flip through the channels just like six choices. Yeah.  And Bob was one of them. Yeah, I grew up very similar to you didn't have satellite. There wasn't ever cable. I mean I saw cable it other people's houses and stuff, but I'd heard I'd heard of it. Yeah, but I mostly grew up in a pretty rural area with whatever we could pick up on rabbit ears back before your digital antenna kids and yeah similar it was, you know, ABC Fox  CBS all the networks and BC and then yeah, we would pick up PBS. Okay, and we also picked up this channel called packs. Oh, yeah, which was like a sewer pipe. I left them off the list. Yeah. Now I feel bad packs came in clear than anything else. Honestly, that's because it had the Lord's power button. And so the best shows on packs were Diagnosis Murder featuring your  And in mind Dick Van Dyke, yeah all all the old reruns diagnosis murder and his son Barry Van Dyke, I think bear bear bear and their family is what Van Dyke brown is named after PS.  You don't know if that's true. Yeah, I'm sure it's fine. So packs would run that and then at night my favorite thing. Maybe I was trying to chill out. They would have nature scenes with this like classical very light remember this I do like classical music in the background be like a water faucet. It's like a live-action Bob Ross painting really this would come on like whenever Dana's murder went off the air or like what was the show?  Highway to Heaven Michael Landon, where are Touched by an Angel whenever those were off. Yeah, you get nature scenes with Bible verse not read aloud, but just projected on top of the nature seemed kind of disrupting the Nature's right? It was sort of, you know flow in and melt away and then this like really light classical music going and it was I mean, it's a great way to fall asleep was fantastic way to fall asleep. I would really like  Like to have been the person who chose the Bible verses for that because I'm just saying throwing something up front of the story of Joe. But over that we righty crates are one of those chapters were it's just someone begat someone else and just slowly covers the entire screen just keeps fading him. We got him. We got him. We got him. We got him the gun. I can't see the Gobi desert of or what the hell so so because I had a similar TV situation and I would  Been a lot of Summers with my grandmother who worked at a dry cleaners and there was a glass top table in the back and a small TV on the glass-top table. She would sometimes have to go to the front and when she wasn't doing that or doing something else we would just sit there and watch TV. So I watched a lot of Price is Right. He's the catch Northern Exposure, which was also pretty cool show and definitely a lot of  EVs and so I'm pretty sure that's where I first saw Bob at some point in there, you know, I was born in 84. So Bob was definitely doing his thing when I was a child same for you. I mean, you're a little bit younger. But yeah, and then she also had her house we stay with her for a while and she had one of those big wooden TVs, you know in an entertainment center. Yeah anything the ones that are an actual piece of furniture. Yeah, exactly. And I remember like spending hours like, you know laying on my stomach on the  Carpet with my hands you propping my head up. And I know I watch Bob Rost are to I'm sure that I did sure that I came across it - just you know, I was watching TV. Yeah General. Yeah. I also if anyone knows and I've mentioned this another podcast. I may have created this memory. I've done a lot of Internet research can't find it. I came across a show on PBS pretty sure it was PBS when I was a kid where a woman  received a test-tube baby on her doorstep and he grew into a little boy and she took care of the little boy. That's basically all I remember but it made an impression on me and I can't figure out what it was. What was that scripted? Yeah, it was scripted. Yeah. It was like it was a drama like a like a you know, kind of a light drama show. Yeah. He was just like a  A premade baby that she got. Yeah like you do. Yeah in her adventures and raising him she was a single, you know single mom. It's like hey, so the baby was still in the test tube. Yeah, he likes showed up and like a capsule or something and she cracked it open and was like, oh my God a baby and it's not scientifically sound. No. No, that's not certainly not I don't I'll talk about this with you later. Okay off the air. Yeah, that's not where baby, okay.  Come from. Oh really? I have a few things to talk to my wife about yeah.  All right, everybody. Let's get knees deep into the Lazy River season 2 episode 10. What a lazy river. It is. Bob hit us with some lazy river. Welcome back. Glad to see you again. Thought today would do just a happy little picture this deep in the woods. Okay original air date, November 2nd 1983. Yeah a nice vintage of Bob tonight. What do we got?  What do we well, I mean we have a lazy river. We have a lazy river. So I'm just going to go ahead and say before we discuss the full painting. Okay. This is one of those paintings that confuses me about Bob sure because I look at it.  And just looking at it. I do not care for the painting. Okay. I don't actively dislike the painting. I just don't care.  I know you're saying not great. So you're saying yeah, but watching him paint it. Yeah, I'm like, oh that's really good. So it's a very confusing situation for me where I like I like the process and I like seeing him do it all but I hate the end result. Yes. Right, right. It's one of those it's enjoyable to watch and put it together. Right and there's a lot of them. I mean he again in this has been  Theme lately he broke out some new techniques that's true, which is really fun and his little toy gun. Yeah. Anyway, yeah, which he we still don't know what it is. Yeah. I don't think we're ever going to know is what it is an our person. Let us know what it's called. Please go watch The Lazy River episode. You can fast forward to about half way through about half way. Yeah, and he pulls out his little little carving gun. That's it. What is it?  We don't know it's his tree branch toy. That's all. I know. That's it. That's it. I picture. It's like it just a crayon and a gun. Yeah, I don't know. I've no clue what sky start with this guy a nice. We got some trees. You said we're at trees and under two minutes. He's painting we get started right away laying in some trees and their background trees are diffuse trees. They're not offensive not offensive at all. Laughs and you know, I  I certainly don't offend me fright. No, I enjoyed these trees. Yeah, quite a bit actually socata Sky trees Tree Trunks and then we start to lay in some ground and the Van Dyke brown makes an appearance pretty soon too and I can tell you I was very concerned. Yeah because as as we've established the last few episodes Van Dyke brown has become my treat. Yeah, I do not.  Not like it when he pulls up a VanDyke anytime. He's reaching for it Nathan shudders a bit. It's just ruined so many things I liked and paintings. It's usually not that bad in situations like this where it's not covering something up already. Right? Right, but still it's a little nerve-racking. Listen. It's it's a very thick and dramatic color and not used properly it can wreath.  No, not wreath. It can it could wreath a kid wreath destruction. Yeah, why not whatever. I'm trying to say. Um, yeah, whoops. There's one that's nice and crooked hate for them all to be straight.  Maybe a fisherman kicked that one when he was just a little baby and he's got a little cooking we get a quick shot of Bob. We rarely get these little Snippets of the full Studio like a wide shot very rarely get those and let me just tell you everybody Bob is packing some heat. Oh, yeah in the back of his pants Bob could back that thing. He's got a tight ass. I mean, he's got the kind of  That's the putting in some cowboy boots and send him to you know, the Wildhorse Saloon here in Nashville. Yeah, and ladies are going to be all over Bob Bob could shake those tail feathers. That's right. Shake it like a Polaroid picture. Oh, yeah. He has very he's a thin man. He has thin skinny, you know kind of skinny arm. Yeah, his frame is skinny, but he's got a couple of well-formed hams under there. You know what I mean? Yeah. No, sir.  Salt added nitrate free organic whole it's like it's like a couple firm mango. That's it. That's it. You know something to hold about that August our lawsuit that we've been waiting for you they talked about is a slot PLS someone put that in a review positive or negative. I don't care just mention that we talk about Bob's ass all the time. This is the predominant Bob's ass podcast. That's right first really cool technique. Yeah.  Even though we're on a lazy river. He never actually paints water. Not at all which still kind of blows my mind a little bit amazing amazing. So Bob's putting a lot of color into the shore the trees the Van Dyke brown the foliage and as he so often does so beautifully he just pulls that down to make a reflection and then hypnotizes it and suddenly as he does this over and over.  Again, you get the real impression that you're looking at a body of water. Yeah, I will say one really positive thing for this painting. It is one of those that really draws you in like I'm being that's true. I'm being drawn down the river right now as I look at it, you know, and there's not even any waves or anything. It's a lazy river. Yeah now it's I mean nothing's happening very aptly named. I I will say yeah, I know this is nitpicking, okay.  That's not river. It's more of a stream even a brook. I don't know. I mean it even looks like it could be a pond a creek. It's not it's not a river but going anywhere. There's no River. Okay. I know it's nitpick. No. No, it's it's a fair. It's a fair point. The only counter I have to that is is I feel like you can see a Bend there is a bit at the very back like there's a suggestion of a Bend, right? Yeah.  And so that means that this continues far beyond what we can see it continues into our imaginations. All right. Okay, I'll give it to you. Okay. Um, so just by pulling all that color down we get this amazing impression. He does a little shorelines the little white. Yeah short lines, which I like a lot as well really, it sets it off from the reflection. Yes. Yeah. It adds a little bit of motion I guess.  And it's just a relaxing picture overall it just I mean my even as it's finished now, I was done with the painting at about 15 18 minutes. I was fine. He could have stopped. We it's another one of those days you wish exactly we get we have this this happens all the time. It was exactly what I wanted right at that point. And then what happened Nathan? Well, I'm glad you asked.  And you noticed another thing here. We put no color into the water all we're going to use for coloring the water is what we pull down.  You don't have to go to a lot of trouble and put color in here. All you do is pull it down. Just wipe across to give it a nice watery Sheen and it looks like water without doing a thing. I'm still not sure exactly what it is. Yeah, but a tree is put in. Oh, yeah now  I have a few things about this tree. So it's on the right side on the bank. Yep. Just a trunk that goes from nearly the bottom past the bottom third right of the painting all the way up the top of the tree is not in frame exactly paint exactly big big big. So it's a very very tall skinny tree. Yeah. I mean very tall skinny tree.  Me being the way I am. The first thing I noticed is on this bank. There's not room in that bank for the root ball for a tree that big. Yeah, there's no way yeah, there's no way that tree survived. Okay. Okay, like it's not going to stay in the ground. It's going to fall over. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Number two. It clearly looks like Bob doesn't study how trees meet the ground. Yeah.  Because both so he does this with this tree and then there's another tree off to the right the another big one both of them the trunk just kind of like curves at the ground. Yeah. Yeah one side like it just goes an L shape. Yeah. It's kind of how I used to paint trees. Yeah, when I was a child, it's that's still how I paint trees by the way. That's not how Roots were right, right.  He pointed out that you need a tree to shade you when you're fishing indeed you do which I mean that's good advice, but I want you to look at that tree real quick. I'm looking at it tell me how much shade like there are trees all over this River very shady trees and you chose the half-dead waterlogged. Tiny rooted giant tree. Yeah as your and like  No shade from that tree that tree is on its last leg. It's about to die. It's even leaning. Yeah, it's leaning towards the water. It's giving up right it's leaning because it's saying if I try hard enough I can drown myself there. You're right. The leaves are sparse. Yeah. However the way we get those leaves is another really cool technique. Oh, it's fantastic. This is palette knife leaves. Yeah brand-new as far as I'm concerned never seen this before he loads up.  Some marbled color. I think it's some green and some yellow maybe a touch a permanent red and places and I love it when he says that to like mix it until it's just marbled marbley and I know what he means right? It's like not completely mixed together. It's a good description. You swirl it it's world price world. It's chocolate and vanilla. Yeah not totally combined. You want the swirl? So he loves that up on the palette knife and extremely lightly touches it horizontally on the branches.  It just makes these Little impressions of like I don't know like levels of leaves and they're just cool. They look kind of Japanese almost, you know, I get some it's a really cool technique and I really like it really is one thing about those branches. Yeah, and I'd like you to explain to me, why are all the branches on the trees growing downwards? That's a great question. I'm just so it's a great question.  Question two trees. Yeah, well and you say to their he not only do we get this one we get another one even more in the foreground. Yeah a little wider. So with the entire leafy portion it out of view. That's correct that the branches that you see they're all just growing straight down. Yeah, it's true. Like they have also given up all this tree is just very depressing. There's no denying it. There's no denying it. What?  Whoever my friend and last tree point I have to make yeah, and I feel very mixed complaining about this because I like the Reflections in the water a lot. Yeah, however  There's no Reflection from from the big tree. Right? Like it didn't reflect. There's a couple big Reflections. He missed it's a vampire vampire who owe a couple of vampire trees. You say maybe that's maybe it's not a real type of tree. Oh Lazy River underscore alternate title vampire trees. We all have established at this point the  Bob's paintings do not exist in reality. Correct. He's painting a fall seen in the middle of winter on a summer day. That's right. Every painting is like in the ocean vampire trees. It could be not Off the Mark. No, I think my question to you is would that necessitate a bonus point it was unintentional unintentional or okay Counterpoint, okay.  Was it fully intentional? Mmm, and we're just the first ones to realize it out. Alright, well, we'll talk about that in a minute. If you're going out here to fish you need a nice tree to sit underneath.  Keep the sun off your head.  I don't know Nathan any other major things about this painting. I mean that Mama less covers a lot the so he spent a lot of time on this. I feel like for what he did. Yeah, but the very end the last thing he did is just some floating Pond scum. Yeah. That was great. We both like the pond scum which it's just a little layer of Van Dyke brown. Yeah, and then mixed some yellow and some green  A little Bush material and and put it on top and you're like, okay, whatever it's fine. Yeah, and then the fan brush just swipes it up. Oh, yeah, and I think we've all seen this on any body of water where it's just like the the kind of like plant sticking out of algae. Yeah type of thing. Yeah. That's what it looks like it. What's this shit growing in the water? Yeah. I mean it for such a small part of the painting. Yeah. He spent an odd amount of time.  On it to me more minutes. Yeah, but it was interesting know. I was very good I get you. I guess it's like a tiny little Island right there. Yeah, and then yeah, of course, he spent a lot of time to filling in foliage a lot of yellow kind of grassy stuff highlighting the land masses, which I always enjoy I do like the Van Dyke rocks with white o it one point. This was really cool to me. He's picking up when he's highlighting. He's  Up some of the not quite dry magic white. Yes off the bark and on about the that was so cool. It's like Bob like you're breaking my mind. Like you're just using what's there man? You're so Zen Bob. He's like who cares? It's right here. I got it. I'm just listen to Bob season to Bob is all over the place compared to season one bomb. Yeah in a good way. Yes season 1 Bob. I feel like was playing it safe. Maybe it was afraid he was going to get kicked out of Muncie. I don't know WIP be  Be pissed but season to Bob. I know he just does his own thing. I you know, I think he is growing in confidence. We're most of the way through only a couple episodes left to season 2. He's a veteran TV painter. Now, that's true. One of only two who have ever existed as far as we know the only one who has success exactly. Yeah. Well, he doesn't yell as much don't tell the Alexander family. I said that we liked you Bill they'll yell at me.  But yeah, just another crazy cool technique. He's just like here's some magic white. I just need a little right here done done using it one every painting the season even the ones we hated. Yeah, there was one thing in each one that you see that you're like, huh love that. Well, okay, he has broken out no less than I would say seven or eight like really crazy cool techniques. Yeah in this season and  a weird gun that we don't know what it is exactly. By the way. This is a total of side, but I was reminded this week of another PBS Superstar who I'm interested in not heal Hauser who I have a deep interest in you. I love you love early and erotic actress who else Huell Howser if you're not familiar, he was based in California. He's actually from Tennessee was from Nashville used to be on TV in Nashville, but he did these shows about traveling around California. It's all on YouTube. Check it out. It's fantastic.  Another one is Justin Wilson the Cajun chef. Do you remember this guy? Oh, I vaguely remember love him. Oh my gosh, you can barely understand what he's saying, but he just makes the most delicious. He's right up there with Julia Child for me makes the most delicious looking food and he's always drinking wine. Where is the Spenders wearing a little Colonel Sanders Tie, by the way, if you're if you're cooking Cajun food, and you're not drinking while you  Cook it. You're not you're not cooking cage. You're doing it wrong. Like you're messing up entire recipe exactly the entire recipe depends on you being slightly slightly. Slosh. You need to do it a little bit, you know overdo it. Yeah. Now what I did there was just picked up a little bit of the magic white so I can put just as very small small amount of highlight into that don't want a lot just a tiny tiny bit. All right. Well, let's do this.  This rate the pain rating great here comes a rating hot into your lap for the Lazy River into your lap. Yeah, that's where we're putting. Our rating is ensure people's laps. Don't you want to go there? I mean I do I wasn't going to be that forward about it. I like a lot of laps for those under the show. Unfamiliar forgetful. Maybe you're forgetful and  Repainting that we we watch is rated on a five category for point scale. Yeah for a maximum score of 20 points any points bonus points can be awarded at our discretion as we see fit. Yeah. This is our show but usually usually involves some someone dying a Drifter an alcoholic mythical creature. It happens in more than you would expect.  Fact there's a magical to te Welbeck. Yeah. Yeah. So lazy river Lazy River first category is visual impact is real impact for is it has the power to wow the viewer, okay.  Three is it has lasting impact to it holds your attention one little or no impact I think for and won both off the both off the table. This is a Midway. That's a pretty extreme a great choice right there for me. Again. It really drew me in. I feel like I'm chugging on down this Lazy River. I used to canoe poorly. Um, but I used to Whitewater canoe and I have seen stretches of river.  Quite like this now that's exciting in one way because it's beautiful. It's not exciting because you have to paddle now right for a while. You don't want to Raft down real lazy Willow. No, no you want these slightly active river that will move you want the agitated River? Yeah, so you would say it has lasting impact on you. Yeah, I would give it a 3 personally. I don't know if I'm being generous. I don't think I am I like this. I really like it.  I feel like I'm I'm being hard on it. Okay, but I feel like it's gotta be two two and a half for me to put a half compromise. Nothing against it. I'm just not going to remember it's fine. It's fine. We don't always have to agree. It wasn't it wasn't memorable to me. Sure. It's good. It's not memorable. Yeah, okay interpretation and creativity.  It shows unique and creative interpretation and the effort was far beyond that required texts a 4 that's a 4 all the way down at A1. It's incomplete and lacks attention to detail is not a wood. It's not a one.    What are you thinking? Well, alright. So a 3 here with more effort. It would have been outstanding. Okay, that's tricky language. It's actually less effort. Right we come to this off. That's true. We come to this point very often. Let's okay. Let's change the looks. I like writing here. I like it with different efforts like it with different efforts have been Yes, i'ii sounds right to me.  Love it. Okay. I'm down with that. Okay, you know what? That's a really good change with different effort because it could be less could be more you know, yeah, I mean there are times he puts way too much into some true. It's true this painting borders on that. I'd like to see Bob do one of those minimal paintings where you only get one color just to see what it would be like, you know, that would be interesting what he or yeah a painting where he's only given 10 minutes, that would also be  Resting because there have been a lot. Yeah where we hit the ten-minute Mark and we're like it's done. I don't know what he's gonna do to fillet. Oh, he got the Van Dyke brown out. What is he doing? It's all gone Melton ruined composition and design. Okay. All right. All right F4 is the design effectively fills the entire space. Okay, and it uses the principles of design.  A1 is he does not understand the principles of he's never going to get a 1 here. No. No, he shouldn't be painting if he ever gets a one right? There is no excuse for getting a one. Correct, correct?  I've I feel like actually a for I would agree. I think he effectively filled the space. Yeah, which it's interesting because of the the amount he didn't paint in the middle exactly like that some good exactly utilization of the space right there again, this gets it that Zen thing, right and that sort of Taoist thing of like, well, there's an old saying like what makes a bowl useful the empty space. Yeah. What makes this painting awesome the empty  Ace and he used it. He used it. I I can't really it's a off any point for it's a beautiful scene. I might re-watch this episode honestly. Yeah, it really means it. Yeah, if you've listened to the podcast but haven't watched any episodes. Yeah, I will say this episode if you just want to see the painting. Yeah, the different styles that he pulls out. Yeah. This is a good episode. I agree. Yeah, I'd recommend this one.  One it's not the most exciting painting. It's not the flashiest episode. No, but the fundamentals of what he does are there. It's really chill and it's all over the place. I mean everything he does is on that canvas indeed indeed craftsmanship. Okay, a for is it's beautiful and complete.  Okay, A1 is its careless know what's a what's a three it demonstrates partial skill and understanding of medium qualities and it's fairly neat. Okay. Hmm. Oh, I'm sorry that that's a that's a chew. Okay, it's pleasing and and mostly complete. I'm gonna lean on a 3 here. I think it's three. Okay. Good good. Yeah good. I think we might pull out a solid B on this.  It's not bad. It's not bad. And of course the criteria. Yes. Now here's where our debate comes in. Oh boy. Pom. Pom pom for those who don't know the four.  Means he met the requirements. He promised us a lazy river. He delivered a lazy river right now. Can we agree that? This is a actually a lazy river It's a lazy body of It's a lazy body of water. So the minimum giving them is a three. Okay. All right. I think the river I think it's a lazy river. Um, because I see the bend  Look deep into creating can bend fine creaks can bend. Okay freaks. All right Rivers. Okay, and they're lazier than Rivers. Sure. It's true. That is actually very true. Good point. What did you say three then?  I mean I could make an argument for a for a three for three. Okay, which I think may be the first time I've ever not given them a four four criteria cat in this Killer. Maybe maybe.  Yeah, if it's ambiguous whether it's a river or not. Yeah, I can't be a for right because that's all we're asked with the saw. He's supposed to deliver its but it does have the lazy. It's got the lazy Dale delays. So it's at least a 2 right. I'm gonna I'm gonna do this. Okay as I gave we averaged out to a half Point earlier. We did three point five. Okay. I'm good with that. I'm good with a 3-1 average it out now 3.5 do the  Trees get a bonus point. Oh boy. No, I think we should give ourselves a bonus Point. Okay, so I get 1 point you get a point one point. Yeah. Well you came up with it. Okay, I'll take two points. You get no I get nothing. Bob doesn't get anything extra. Right? Right. Okay, so plus to Nathan bonus tree vampire trees got right. I'm putting that down The Ledger.  By the way, my maximum score was Zero. Yeah, so I'm so far above your ward I could possibly so what's the total here? Let's see you have you have the numbers in front of you? I don't you I do. Hang on so that number.  This is this is riveting. I know we are looking at a 16 16 out of 20 20. Yeah.  That's an 80 he got the be boom. I need sold out the be - yeah be - yeah, but I mean not bad. It's a beam. I know I agree it started and it's not be you know, what we I think our expectations were much lower. Honestly. I I really honestly didn't know good. Like I said watching the episode right late just looking at the painting. Let's say you go to now no an art gallery in  Go and they have Barbara's paintings. And this is one of them. Yeah, you're going to look at and go hmm and move on because without watching it being painted. It's it's not anything. It's not gonna sink into your psyche like some other paintings. Yeah, it's not amazing. No, it's not that's the lasting impression. You know, that's that's I think is a real key thing. But like last last week's episode. Yeah, that's a painting that you  Remember, right the last episode we did was very memorable dance in the mud sticks in the mud this one. Yeah. Yeah that said if I encountered it, I would stop and again be drawn into it for a moment. Yeah, lasting impact maybe not but I'm but it definitely had an impact right, you know, but watching it right you and seeing all of the techniques the the technique with the lead.  Is the technique where you didn't pay any water? No water. That's my magic water. Yeah, that's impressive that magic water might be my favorite thing this season. Yeah, honestly, honestly, really really cool really cool and definitely worth seeing it come together just a doubly recommend the episode for sure. Yeah Link in the show notes PS. Yeah. We always link read the show notes the show notes. You know, how much?  Work just inputs into the show notes quite a bit actually literally weeks that quit his job just so you could write these show knows it. That's it's all I'm doing now.

spotify:episode:70AMLgTqYf1ICUTCPa2wSJ	Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to a new episode of panning the scream. My name is Dan Reichert. I'm one of the hosts of this here podcast sitting across me my wife Bianca Reichert. How are you doing? I'm well, how are you? I'm doing good. We always say episode.  My head about what we new episode welcome to a new episode know I was thinking about that like once you said that that's all I can think about like, yeah, I guess it is a new episode but it didn't sound. Where do I say? We usually say welcome to a new edition now you welcome to the new I feel like you usually just say welcome to panting the stream. Oh, okay. Maybe that's it. Yeah. Okay. Well, I'm really just bone that up didn't I? Yeah, it's you know, it's a day of failure. You couldn't get your your Most Wanted fast food item of all time and item that you said was more you  Then you are. Yeah, the Pizza Hut cheese It Whatever It Is the Cheese's pizza, is it a it's called a pizza? Whatever the fuck it is. It's a giant whale comes in a thing of four and they look like just big old cheese at pockets and side temporary tweeting about it last night and just made me so sad that I'll never get to experience that apparently never get to experience. Well, I'm thinking about walking to the one at Madison Square Garden after work one of these days and seeing if I can get one there.  Because there's Pizza Hut. Okay Pizza Hut was King growing up in the midwest. They were like, they were synonymous with pizza. The way McDonald's was synonymous with like burger and Fry fast food places. Okay, and you grew up out here on the East Coast near New York City. I have found that in California when I lived there and in New York Pizza Hut is not the king as I know it from growing up. So I mean you didn't you have like a ton of Pizza Hut's you had no my Domino's or anything we had them but like  You ever had pizza ever. I mean my entire even if I went back there now, you know, it's not like it was a back in the 80s back in the 90s thing. It's like it's still the case. It's like if somebody's ordering pizza, you know eight times out of 10. It is going to be Pizza. Well when we were over for our friend's wedding a few months ago after we got back to the house and we're all drunk and stuff. They ordered Papa John's. Yeah. There's a lot of that to I would say Pizza Hut was number one and then it was kind of between Domino's and Papa John's for number two as  Far as like frequency, but oh man have any just like regular pizza places. That weren't chains. There was Minsky's which is I think more of a local Midwestern one, they would be around. It's nothing like here. I mean, they're be chains like Old Chicago and stuff like that. But it's Pete that it's six four eight eight eight you call that up. They bring a pizza. Okay? Yeah, and so I'm shocked and saddened to be honest that I'm not able to call in there should be six Pizza Hut serving our apartment. Yeah. It is crazy and Fortune we have to settle for like the  S Pizza we've ever had a few blocks away. I'm not gonna I'm not gonna talk shit on New York City Pizza. I think it's incredible. So some Jose down in the village some pizza Supreme Over ymsg. What is the one in the a preset that we really like? Oh the p p q r is yeah Peak. Yeah, that place is super good. Like no New York City Pizza is incredible. But sometimes you just want some straight up garbage. And actually honestly that was let's cut to something. We usually do with the end is suggestions my suggestion for the folks at home this  Week is a if you're ever given an opportunity in life, you need to grasp it because not everyone gets those opportunities and I don't have the opportunity to pick up a phone and have a pizza in the shape of a cheese. It arrived at my house. Right and I'm saddened and there's nothing I can do about it. So fortunate situation, if you're less fortunate than other people, I agree. I agree. So if you are one of the fortunate folks in this great country that can pick up a phone or type something in on your keyboard and then  Magical cheese, it shaped Pizza like things show up at your house. Just you know, Carpe Diem. Is that seize the day? Yeah, so a little bit of motivation in there a little bit of a straight-up suggestion. My suggestion was just going to be the Great British Bake Off is back. So yeah, that seems like a very pleasant show area kind of live like every Friday. It's a new episode instead of just putting the whole bundle up on Netflix that once there aren't live on Netflix now live but like they actually goes life goes live like I do like a week before its end.  Netflix and then so yeah instead of usually it's like the whole series is done the whole season is done and then they put all the episodes up at once. Oh, so would Arizona television station and then comes to Netflix? Yeah. It's a British show. It's like a BBC thing. It used to be BBC now, it's some other British Channel. Okay. Got you. All right. Well suggestions up front. There you go folks front loading the podcast and food-related suggestions there. Hey, if you're if you're tuning in for the thing we do on this podcast the thing we do is watch things on Netflix or Hulu or what have you.  The streaming internet is All the Rage of the kids today. You know, what else the kids love the Breaking Bad. Yeah kids love to break that these days they do. They're constantly Breaking Bad. It's a highly relatable tale of a chemist turn chemistry teacher turn meth cook Kingpin me a Stern dead guy then. Yeah, then he dies. Yeah, which we assume you for listening to this episode. You're probably all caught up on Breaking Bad. What a show one of the best of all time. I know that's not a controversial opinion. I know it is below  loved by millions and millions. I watched it as it aired. Actually I started watching it when I live in Kansas. Actually. It's actually it's been a while. It started like O8 so nice. I'm like that my roommate Trevin at the time turned me on to it early in season 2 and so I caught up on his DVD a season one and I started watching live and season 2 and watched every episode like that was like a appointment viewing. Yeah, especially I lived in Minnesota like that was during like the Heyday of like seasons four and five with all the stuff with Gus and obviously that the the finale and everything.  Is the thing where it's like a bunch of us Game Informer guys, we'd all go to Ben Reeves Place or we go to Brian boards place and that we would all just gather around the TV and watch it live and it was like an event, you know, it was great. I feel like I got into it a little late at probably got engine like 2012 and then I went like I downloaded all the previous episodes and then my family and I started watching it. So we're you like binge the first three seasons I want to say and then the subsequent two seasons we had watched as it aired and it was really like, I feel like that doesn't happen anymore like where you have like a show that you watch with your family like live as it is happening.  Happening, you know, you make you like put it on the calendar and like everyone is there and really into the story feel like Game of Thrones. That was some people like I was in New Jersey with my parents. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, we're all really into that show ask Escape Escape, except. I remember at the towards the end of the show that one scene where he's like say my name. Yeah and the guys like Heisenberg my mom then said who's Heisenberg?  After watching the entire series up to that point that's kind of a critical part of that show. Does she knows he's like Moonlighting as a method? Yeah, I assumed I mean she watched the show. She knows the teacher and the hat guy are the same person right? There's you think Bryan Cranston has a equally talented twins ahead guys. Yes, I thought seasons 1 2 & 3 got progressively better each one. I remember like by season 3 I was obsessed.  Yeah, and I actually saw the last episode you had pause. I think you're on the episode called one minute. Which if I remember right the end of that episode is one of my all-time favorite TV seems I remember that just be incredible if it's the one I'm thinking of I don't say too much because I know you've seen it all but I've seen it all but like I'm so I started re-watching it just like as part of the El Camino hype and I didn't finish re-watching it before the movies. I'm kind of like in the middle of season 3 right now. Yeah, and I remember the big beats, but there's so much I forgot about and stuff. So it's  On to watch it again, man. That shows so good. Yeah. I walked in while you're watching his earlier today. It's saying we're Hank just shows up at Jesse's and just beat the fuck out of yeah, like what was that? Like, he fakes a call from Hanks wife to get him. Well, it was that scene where Hank is like hot on the trail of Jesse because he knows that Jesse has an RV and that it's a rolling meth lab. So Brian Walter finds out about this and then goes to the junkyard where it's being held to have  It destroyed and then Badger tells Jesse and Jesse comes to keep that from happening and then Hank immediately comes because he was on the tail of Jesse. So there Walter and Jesse are locked in their RV with Hank right outside. That's right. Yeah, so looking in bullet holes and legs really tense yet super tense and then Walter has an idea and he calls Saul who's assistant calls Hank and says she's the police and that her wife. His wife is an accident. So that's right. And that's why Hank is especially pissy. Yeah. He's a he's a  The tough guy in that show if I remember right? Yeah, he's there's definitely a lot of like racist stuff that I didn't remember about him. But Hank like I don't remember was he like straight-up racist? I mean, yeah, he doesn't like Hispanic people. Oh, really? Yeah, I guess I don't member that wrinkle to his character. But yeah, well, he just makes fun of a lot. Oh, yeah. I mean he like I just remembered him as a solid dude. Yeah. He like is like a reliable capable guy, but like that's you know, I guess in that  session, you know working in at the DEA and New Mexico. There's probably a lot of like Mexican drug cartels toughest to deal with so now that I'm excusing it rightly sure at all. I do remember in the earlier Seasons, it seemed like they were positioning him as this like obnoxious Meathead brother. I was Skylar and then like obviously as the show went on like near the end. He is seen as kind of this like flawed But ultimately, you know, like the he's like, I mean, obviously the shows about Walter but he is the force that like you really  I want to win but he is the one that is representing good in the show in a way. Hey, yeah, or at least law enforcement. Right, right. Yeah, baby shouldn't be considered good. But well, I remember there was a lot like that show was one of the shows that was really difficult to like just straight up route for characters because virtually everyone like had these things where it's like, okay Hank is, you know, doing good things law enforcement wise but like also seems to be kind of a shitty dude at times like you want to root for  Walter White early on in the show but clearly the whole point of the show is that he progressively becomes a worse and worse person a but I still remember rooting for him at the end. Yeah. I feel like near the end. Like they were just like Walter at the end of the Show versus beginning of the show or two completely different characters. Yeah. Yeah. He's I think he's position is way more sympathetic early on. Oh, yeah. It's really interesting to see the evolution of it because the first season there's so much like levity in it because he's just a chemistry.  He's really like a fish out of water in that first season and then he starts to embrace the role a little more and then I feel like the the turning point was when he didn't save Jane from choking on her own vomit. Yes, and because then it was clear like he's willing to just put his self-interest above, you know, someone else's life even yeah. No not that I've she had huge consequences with the mid-air Collision that killed like, you know, a ton of people. Yeah. I remember like the James death was like, okay.  Okay, he didn't kill her but he could have saved her and then it just like it kept kind of ramping it up where it's like, oh, there's that scene where he hits those guys with the car and just tried to shoot him in the head, you know, and then it's like okay he's becoming more and more okay with just like murdering right to the point where like other people like fear and respect him and he's like getting off on it. Right and like yeah, I mean I it's in it's such an interesting character study because there's this guy who you know, obviously was this chemist who had so much promise and contribute to the like the Nobel Peace Prize.  Nobel Nobel Nobel Peace Prize or whatever it was and and then he just gets down on his luck and he's like a chemistry teacher in a high school and it was like so like stepped all over and like, you know kind of bossed around by his wife a little bit and like, you know, just getting sad handjobs. All right, we got about that while she's on eBay. Oh and that, you know, I forgot that saying like once he does one of his first like meth dealer things wherever he comes back with all this confidence and like whoa, what's going on in bed here? Yeah. That's right.  Yeah, the relationship between him and Skylar is really interesting Skyler. I know it. I feel like the show doesn't have people that like you were saying before it doesn't have people that are straight up good straight up bad like Skylar, obviously, you know, that's a sympathetic character. She it's hot. It's kind of hard. Sometimes I have sympathy for her because the one time when she like has sex with her boss like she just goes so goes home and like he's making dinner for everyone and she's like I fucked it or whatever. I forgot about that. Yeah, that's but then it's also like well, she really wants him to  Force her she really wants him to agree to the divorce because she but he won't agree to it. That's why he's because she knows that that point that he's a drug manufacturer. Okay? Yes. I think I'm a lot of the like, you know, the big bombastic scenes and like the really like thrilling ten scenes and seven. I kind of forget a lot of the details of the like, you know, interpersonal stuff and the family stuff or like oh Hanks wife is shoplifting, you know like that type of stuff that didn't really go anywhere. Yeah. Yeah. I was telling you this earlier but like re watching Breaking Bad the thing that I feel  feel like other shows are like just not really no other show has been able to emulate this quality like the whole show feels like a singular unit. That's like such a natural progression. It doesn't feel like they're making it up as they go along. It really feels like everything was planned for even though you know, I feel like most people are aware of the fact that Jesse was supposed to be killed off in the first season. But but like it feels like all the all the pieces were set up before I like Walters character like his fate was known when they started filming that show, you know,  Open about it. They're like hey, this show is going to end with him dead and like it's just a matter of like we don't know it's going to be a bullet or cancers going to get a murder what the deal is? Yeah, but ultimately like, you know, we talk about the sympathetic characters and everything and this this movie is Jesse Pinkman are in Paul's character after like directly after the events of the final season. I feel like is one of the most sympathetic sympathetic characters in the show. That's what I want to ask you is because you're kind of watching it. Now, you're around like season 3 or whatever. I'm trying to remember like if he is one of the more sympathetic ones or if  there was was there step in the early Seasons where he's like, I know he's always kind of like obnoxious and cocky and stuff. But like was he ever just doing like in excusably shitty things. He was really obnoxious and cocky in the first like for most of the for all the first season and most of the second season and he makes stupid like short-sighted choices and like ultimately he starts doing heroin with Jane stuff and but then he goes to rehab and he gets clean and then after that it seems like he accepts that he's the bad guy.  And just kind of stopped trying to fight it and just Embraces his role as this myth manufacture this cook and you know, he's more confident now because he has he knows how to make meth as good as wallets at this point. It's right. Is there ever a point where he's making it independently and selling it? Yeah. That's that's a kind of what's starting to happen now in the show, okay, because I'm her like where I am in the show right now. So I'm worried. There's the part where it's Gus a big factor because I member they were in like Gus's lab for a while is that after that's more like season for real Walt is in Gus's lab now.  Now, okay, then that like really nice like high quality lab and everything. Yeah. Okay. Got you. That's where like to fly episode and all that stuff was that's right. So I was doing a I was looking up some stuff because I remember that the show like all of the events of the show take place on a pretty accelerated timeline. So the entirety of the show takes place within two calendar years. Wow. It's a supposed to take place between like late September 2008 to early September 2010. Wow, and be in the you see how old he is member there's like the cake or the bacon with the 48.  49 whatever however old he was and so I'm trying to remember at the beginning of the show was Jesse actively in high school. No. Okay, was he freshly out of there? Like no. Okay. So he's supposed to be honest. I don't say exactly when he graduated but he says like oh that was a while ago that I was in your class something that happened. Yeah choke I couldn't move you're still there because I was trying to do the math on it because Aaron Paul is 40 and so it's like I feel like he was depicted as like mid-20s at the oldest. Right Michelle. I think he would be at his mid twenties because  They say when Jane dies and I assume there are similar image. They said she was dead at 26. So I spoke earlier on there. So I guess Hollywood has done crazier things and having a forty-year-old play like a mid-20s person. You know, he still looks youthful. It's like he's just young. Yeah, for sure. I mean it's his face is a little puffier for sure. But uh, yeah, the Aging stuff is interesting. Well, yeah, I'm like I said as I mentioned I'm watching the re watching the show again. So all these people's faces are fresh in my mind and Badger and skinny Pete in the movie.  Look like pretty much identical to what they look like in the show. Yeah, Jesse's parents, especially the mom aged considerably as did Todd. I mean he he still looks young but he put on a lot of weight like when you go back to that like the actual show, he was very skinny. Yeah, I that was when I noticed the most was Todd because I'm over him seeing seeming like kind of a youthful dummy in the show and now he definitely seems older and he's shown up another stuff with Simon that date night movie and yeah, he's got some work. Yeah. He has he's good at playing with like  Creepy kind of makes you uncomfortable guy. But yeah, I forgot how terrible is characters in the show. Oh, yeah. He's a total sociopath. I forgot about that cuz there's that scene. Well again, if you're not there yet. Well, I guess we're just kind of like spoiling stuff. Yes, but guess where he shoots the kid on the motorcycle. I'm trying to think he shot Brock's mother and yeah, yeah. Yeah, so like him enough, so he's just complicit and and having Jesse locked in a cage. Oh, yeah my God associated with these white supremacist and everything like yeah, he's sucking also he  Like full-on sociopathic like no emotion about any of it. Yeah. Well, he kills his housekeeper for finding like a little bit of his money and then he's like, what do you think she was looking up in the encyclopedia ma'am? For Mexico? It's just like that but not even joking like right and she's like rolled up like her body is rolled up in the carpet while he's just like there's no urgency of like getting around. He's just yeah. Okay. Yeah, I guess we should take her out and bury her. She was nice, you know, it's like whoa, Jesus Christ. Also when they when he when Jesse stumbles upon her body in the kitchen, it looks like she's been there for a while, so he's probably just like, you know walking.  Around this corpse decaying on the ground. Yeah, there was an interesting character. I thought for sure like obviously one of the more just straight up evil ones on the show. I think yeah.

But yeah, it's he is one of the many characters from the old show that died by the end of the series that because I think this Jesse chokes with the chain at the end. Yeah. Yeah, so they pretty much do a lot of fan service stuff. Like we see Mike ehrmantraut, you know, he's at the beginning. I think it's right before Mike dies is when that flashback was and then Walter gets a scene. It's pretty inconsequential one. It's them eating at a diner. But you know, I feel like they felt like they had to get Bryan Cranston in there. They're going to Breaking Bad movie.  It is nice to see him, you know, nothing to substantial there. I don't think any of the flashbacks really outside of Todd and maybe like Badger and skinny Pete kind of actually played an active role. Well Tata steel flashback baby events of that play into what happened in El Camino. Were there any I don't think there were flashbacks with Badger and skinny Pete. I think that was all right. I guess I'm just talkin to like returning character. Oh and whatever form words like but Todd's flashbacks kind of played into what's going on currently and El Camino and then Badger and peed are like  actively like they kind of kick things off with the actual car and everything. We get a flashback with Jane that's you know, another one was kind of in consequential but if a service like hey, you know here she is remember her. Yeah. No Saul which I guess I guess that was less of a need because it's like hey, if you want to see more Saul Goodman, they've got that. Yeah, and I was actually thinking this before because it's called El Camino a Breaking Bad movie. I almost wonder if they might explore some of the other characters Fates as well. Like what happened with Skylar and stuff like that.  Know that I mean like Saul has his own show like and granted it is pre the events of Breaking Bad. But yeah, and I think it'd be harder like I'm curious to see what happens to like Skylar and all that like in the context of maybe a bigger thing, but that might be a harder movie to make exciting because like characters like Jesse and Saul and stuff are involved in like shady, you know, crazy criminal stuff and like Skylar's I assume what that character would be doing is just trying to raise a family outside of all that craziness, you know, I think like when I look back and braking  That in retrospect. I kind of forgot what a huge part of the show the family drama is you know, so I think there's a lot of stuff there. I mean there's Marie her whole thing with Hank being dead and stuff like what's going on with her like what are going to be the consequences like legally of Skylar being well aware of this methane happening and you know helping with the money laundering I remember her doing at one point, you know right there. So there's something interesting stuff that they could do. I don't think it would be like a whole film specifically on that the Skyler story or whatever.  Her and I know she's she has incurred the ire of Breaking Bad viewers, like people fucking hate her for some reason. Yeah, she's really I forgot what an amazing actress she is in that show. He's right Anna Anna Gunn and a gun. Yeah. I'm a rapper singer in Deadwood. Yeah, and she's in Seinfeld to choose a room set of Seinfeld. Also another person from Seinfeld when Seinfeld had that like meta show called Jerry where they pitched a show about nothing to NBC right right and then in aired like  It's a piece of aired in one episode of Seinfeld and the guy who played Kramer is the guy who owned the junkyard that guy. Oh that like that we see briefly in this really helps them are is helping them get rid of that Aquino know he discovers the the LoJack tracking device on it here. Yeah, I would say actually speaking of dead wood. This kind of reminds me of the Deadwood movie that you know, it's a show that his beloved and was off the air for a long time and now it's like oh, wow, I can't believe we're getting more dead wood or Breaking Bad. Well, I'm like  Unlike dead would actually like Breaking Bad could have just you could have just had Breaking Bad and that would have been fine. I kind of had a bow wrapped. I like even though we don't know exactly what happened with Jesse. That's fine. You know, I mean, we know he got out of there but great like Deadwood. I feel like there was like just a ton of unanswered questions like the bad guy. If you just leave it how it was like you were telling me like the bad guy centrally wins. It did not have a conclusion at always breaking bad had a very kind of definitive one. Yeah, the open-ended like, where's Jessie going type thing, but it reminded me of the Deadwood movie and that like, you know, this is  Isn't like this isn't the the height of the drama of the show at its peak, but it's more just like hey, here's another couple of hours in that world that you liked, you know, here's some characters, you know, let's revisit these characters and see how they are. You know, Deadwood it's different if there's like ten years later whatever in this show directly after but I have the same feeling watching this as I did in the Deadwood movie where it's all right. I really like Breaking Bad. I like the way this is the direction and everything and some of the scenes were really tense. I thought the one one of my favorite sayings was when Jesse is going to Todd's apartment trying to find where he stashed.  This money and then these two guys who he thinks are cops, you know come in and I thought that was a really fun like tense scene were like when a gun appears when you first, you know, holding hostage and everything. I thought that was super good trying to think other ones that there's a duel in a welding place later on that I thought was really fun, you know a bunch of guys that seem to be at least associated with the like white supremacist group and everything and then they have the Dual and then there's the bird with a mustache fake cop and Jesse are shooting at each other for like 20 feet away and I feel like they  there's like 20 rounds they go off and they they miss each other constantly. Well Jesse had that like smaller gun, which I guess was actually really powerful gun that he hid from the other guy. So the 22. Yeah, I don't know. Well, I think the 22 was the one that he was like, but I was visible in his pant Grandpa one. Yeah. Yeah that smaller one. That is that must have been stronger hidden away because that one just blew that guy way. So I think like he might have used the ammunition for that one and then had to use the 22 to try to kill that's why he shot at him a few times with that and then took the handgun and then it wasn't  After that that the mustache guy was shot in the head. Okay? Yeah. I thought that scene was really cool. And that was a very Breaking Bad moment when he's like driving away is to place is exploding. How do I remember there's a lot of that in the show where it's like even one of the first like rebellious things that Walter does when they dickheaded the gas station and what does he do? He like opens up the hood and he puts like the mop or something on the thing. They walks away is the car there's a blow up or does it just I don't know. I haven't I don't remember. I don't remember there being one of the first things I could be wrong. Oh, I guess this is probably when they had the car wash which came and like season for want to say  Say and I was saying earlier that like seasons 1 through 3. I feel like I got more and more and more into it. And then for I remember it's really good and it's really important to the story because that's where like Gus becomes like a really big thing. I remember it ends extremely satisfying with the gust stuff, but I'm afraid that being kind of a slower burn for most of the season and then I remember being way back into it again with season 5 yea. Well season 5 is when it all comes together. Yeah, which yeah, I really love the the ending of Breaking Bad and there are a lot of shows that I've just been disappointed with how they got there.  Doubt rather than you know, I always bring up lost. But yeah, well, there are so few shows that you can look back on and be like this entire show was so good. This whole story was so good. Yeah. Yeah and even if like for is my least favorite season, it was still like really really good, you know, like it's just expertly made show and movie like, you know, I love Vince Gilligan's writing and directing and everything and like just every actor he picked Giancarlo Esposito, you know for Gus and everything was so good and I see that stuff now with Better Call Saul like I'll see commercials or like Clips on award shows or whatever and it's like  oh shit. I didn't know Gus was part of the show now because I have not seen Better Call Saul and I don't have a really good reason outside of like, oh wait, actually I watched the first episode or two, but I just don't like prequels very much. I don't either because it's like it's like, oh great Mike and Gus and Saul or in this but like you remove the tension of anything super serious happening to them. I always think that way but then when I do see prequels, I'm always like oh I was totally wrong about that. You know what and that's why I think I need to watch Better Call Saul is everyone I've heard so many people say like, it's  Better than Breaking Bad. It's so good. I love Bob Odenkirk, and I'd love to see more gust scenes and everything. I'm sure you know, I trust Vince Gilligan, you know, everything he's done that I've seen has been awesome. So I really should give that show. Yeah, I remember watching the first season and I really enjoyed it. But then I just for some reason I just fell off of it. But yeah, I mean inherently it's a lot. There's going to be a lot more like a lot like much more variation stuff that happens because I would think Saul is dealing with all these different kinds of clients rather than just this like same group. I mean there are there are characters from  Breaking Bad in the show they occurring like Mike ehrmantraut or whatever. I think that was one of my concerns when I started watching it was like in the first episode I want to say at the end of it. It's like they go to some guy's house and the door opens and it's too cold. It's like, oh remember Tuco and I was like, hey, man, is this just going to be like, hey, we're shoehorning every Carriage from breaking bad and it was ago they've known each other for years, you know, it's but I don't think I have founded worries about that considering what people say about the show so I should at some point. Yes, and we should definitely yeah a couple notes I had from the beginning that I thought.  Honey, we're fucking badgering skinny Pete. I the keeping up the tradition of Breaking Bad their depiction of video games being just like I guess funny but also frustrating like you remember in the first run. I think they did an official like sponsorships thing with rage the the ID game because but it's so confusing because everyone knew that rage was gonna be like a doom like or attempting to be doing like first person shooter when I was coming out and then it's Jesse playing it with a light gun. So it's like that they build like a  weird light gun build of this game to put it in break bit. Like why doesn't he just blew? That was really weird. I remember but this one. Oh God, they're playing just some it's very unclear. What's happening. There is a road at night and they're playing in first person driving a car and then I just wish anybody was on said that I've ever played a video game because like I hate gamer talk and shows in this one is especially it's like skinny Pete was made your Apex into early. You're a mixing too early. It's like MIT. I have played a million games of the million. People had never heard anyone talk like that your Apex thing too early. Yeah.  It's remember I think feel like the worst example of that was or maybe I should say the best example of that was in that show Russian doll that we watch watch for the past God because she's a game developer. She's a game developer and like shoot they would she was in some game developer meeting where she like had some picture of a 3D render of something and it would just look so shitty and like why would you ever be talking about this? Like I've been to so many like I've been to a few development Studios. That's have you obviously. Yeah and the nothing like that everything not going to discuss this shitty model. Well, they had like an emergency.  Meeting it's supposed to be like rock star. I think it's like kind of implied. It's like New York City. It's like a rock star at a studio or something and they're having this emergency meeting because like the walk cycle is broken and they're watching like a wireframe walk weird, but then like her game wound up being like it looks like a shitty flash clone of like braid it like this. Okay gets just anyone on set. That was way too fucking maybe that's a future career for me is just having me sit on sets of shows. If you're going to show a video game at any point. I'll be like a consultant for that. Yeah. I bet that doesn't look like video games. Yeah, especially because now video games are  You know, it's not like a little niche thing that only nerds like or whatever. Yeah. Yeah, everyone plays video games so you can really get away with that shit as much anymore. Yeah fucking 40 year old virgin then playing Mortal Kombat deception with 64 Controller. I think it's like a 64 controller and like a game controller. It might as well be a fucking flight stick or something somebody on that fucking set. I'll tell you what isn't annoying. What's that? Skinny Pete? What a good guy. He obviously really cared about Jesse. I thought what he did was very sweet. I also loved how he apparently just has pockets full of  Burner phones charged and ready to go at all times just because like him his friends are all shady as hell there. Oh, yeah, totally got a burner for you. Go for it. You know he wanted to take care of them and like, you know who's clean towel and let him use his hero. You're my hero man. Yeah. That was that was sweet. Yeah a nice guy. Yeah. I also love that. They just have a gigantic trampoline in the front yard of their shitty house. Thought that was really fun Zach. Yeah, it's two hours long. It's a lot of flashbacks and it's a pretty simple story at the end of it. It's just like okay Jesse.  Games, but he's wanted by the law. So he's basically just trying to start over and I talked to Robert Forester who actually just died right after this came out which is interesting. I forgot that he had been in the show, but you mentioned that he had shown up at some point. Yeah. I think the remember that happening he's like the kind of guy that you need a new identity to start fresh. Yeah sets you up and then Transit does the transportation everything. Yeah, like passport and all that stuff. Yeah, then it ends with you know, he he gets what he wants. He's able to kind of stowaway we  Exactly know but we know that he ends up in Alaska and he has a fresh start but it kind of ends the same way that Breaking Bad ends where he's just driving off to really who knows what fate but I think it's we can assume it's much more positive than you know, the events of this this movie where it's much more peaceful like they both end with him driving a car off into an unknown future. But like the first ones just like manic screaming and laughing and this was like, yeah, I'll ask is nice and quiet. Yeah. Well, yeah the at the end of Breaking Bad he had just been released or escaped from like a  Essentially being a like slate tortured like my white supremacist in a cage and yeah, like I thought it was interesting how they worked in the welder guy. I can't remember that actor had actually shown up in the show or not. He looked kind of familiar, but even if he didn't like I thought those fake cop characters were played very well. Yeah totally so yeah, I mean overall it's I don't think this I don't think this is like match the highest moments of Breaking Bad by any means because obviously those had whole Seasons, you know, leading up to the big moments, but this is totally like, I really enjoyed it. I enjoyed being back in that world. I feel like worst case.  Scenario, we would say like this movie really wasn't necessary. But I don't think that's the case at all. I think that it was a nice little book into Jesse's story, you know, we have idea of the stuff he went through and he seems way more mature now and like, you know confident and you know, just gonna get a fresh start and you know, he has the flashbacks with Jane at the end which I thought were a sweet call back. You know it he clearly Jane meant a lot to him because he was devastated after she died at that.  Tone of all the characters kind of match with how they were in the show it also true to those characters and just seeing some more scenes like that. We're solid I would say Todd's outside of Jesse. Obviously, I think Todd was the one that I enjoyed his story in this more because I mean again, he had more I think had more screen time than most - are any of the other returning characters? So now we're all my that's a thumbs up on this is your Breaking Bad fan. Absolutely if you like Breaking Bad, then definitely watch this indeed. Well, that'll be it for this week.

If you guys didn't get a chance to check out our last video. Be sure to check out the link down in the description box below. We are back for another Triple Threat Sports podcast. Now before we get into the Super Bowl edition of Triple Threat Sports podcast. I got to introduce you guys to my co-host first co-host. Say what up C ewan's what up next you guys know him as UT X JG to dine, but he's also known as the  The LA Rams supporter and he's going to the Superbowl. Say what up, GG don't it? Feel so good though. It feels so good. The lone person the triple threat Sports podcast by team is going to the shelf and people are mad and we gonna talk about it man. We got we definitely going to talk about it for sure. So at the time of this recording we've already gone through the Pro Bowl which was yesterday. I'm sure some of you guys watched it and you know whoopty whoopty Doo I've  Interest in the Pro Bowl after like I turned I 15 but AFC 126 to 7, but we're going to talk about these NFL Conference Championship games. You got to between the Rams and the Saints which whoo, boy, there's a lot of controversy behind that one and then the Chiefs and the Patriots before we get to the smoke and everything like that because jg's been handing them out all this week. Let's go ahead and start going into the NFL conference championships for the Patriots and the Chiefs now, I'll go with you.  First Ziggy what you think of that game? And did you think Man pages had it from the jump or what would you think babe?  I mean, I had a feeling the pictures win. I want to the Chiefs win. We talked about, you know, we made a mistake that the Patriots beat them. The first time I thought being at home was going to be the difference and they don't look like it would have been the difference but there was a lot of key mistakes of the chiefs made and we all we all knew from the beginning of the year that if the chiefs were going to go farther defense or it was going to have to play better and the defense was still  ferocious and it was not even more magnified because I don't know what this did was thinking lining up in the neutral zone that killed them at the end of the game to make it to where it was pretty much essentially. I think that's what made it to where the tide right? Yeah. Well they went to overtime and you can you gave because you gave Tom Brady to and a hat over two and a half minutes The Comeback because the chiefs were winning in the fourth quarter that she's had to score 24 points in the fourth quarter.  After going the first half score list and then you give took Tom Brady even though he's a little baby you give Tom Brady 30 seconds or more. That's all he needs to be able to drive it down the field no matter who is Personnel is I would say 35 seconds or more because he actually had 32 that wants to yeah instruments and laws, and that's true. I mean favorite and only no no, I knew I knew I knew and and way too quick.  Way to quake and I yeah, I had a feeling that was gonna happen. But the thing that was really that that play I was talking about the was when he lined up and it was a was a five-year plan to give him the first down whatever it was and that that killed that killed them they really did but um, but I was a very entertaining game and I was hoping that she can pull it off but you know, we could talk about that. Also. I know everybody I know that was a big controversy with the Saints in Ramsgate the we'll get to a little bit but  Once again the game being decided in overtime with the sudden death the touchdown thing. I think kind of killed the excitement of the game because everybody else started talking about like well, obviously if the pages margin for the wind, it doesn't seem fair and I can see I mean I've been talking about these overtime rules the NFL for years now, even when they switch to this it's better than what it was before it definitely is it makes no sense to make it to where or you have a chance to go for it with field goals, but not touch.  Donna to me. That's that's dumb. Why is it why can't it just be any score if you if you march down the field the other ball first and you score period whether it's a field goal whether it's a whether it's a touchdown, why can't the other team had the chance to try to get that also it doesn't make sense that it's only for funerals. I never understood that logic but you know, that's it is the rules and I think though this magnifies being the deal it was such an entertaining game, you know, I think a lot more people are now starting to question. Like why why why is it that the Patriots win just because they can  Touchdown not give the cheese chance because I would think everybody would assume that the cheese can easily support session also because the way the game was going they were going back and forth at the end, but, you know, we'll never know. That's the rules it always seems to always benefit that the Patriots in the end. So whoever won the coin toss, which we already do whatever have their out with Paisley to win the coin toss. They could say that about somebody's gonna win. He's gonna get the touchdown and sure enough. It happened. It was like kind of destroy it for me, but you actually just a joy to coach these Tom Brady and  They're back in it again. My third year in a row by the way, man, JG man your thoughts go for it. Yes. Well, I didn't get to see the majority of the game. I did up coming back home around the fourth quarter. Are you are partnering. Yeah, you were celebrating. Yeah, but not not I wasn't partying actually has some some wedding stuff to do. So look at that man being an adult. Look at you. Yeah, man. Yeah gonna be an adult. So um, but when I did see personally I was like yo like  Okay, first of all garage showed up, so he stopped just strictly blocking. They actually used him and he was very effective Edelman was very effective and it would just overall like on the Patriots side Brady didn't have to do that much because literally the running backs handled it all like it was it was pretty crazy. Like how once again the running game was like that dominant when you're thinking about the team like the Patriots and you thinking about the goat Tom Brady, but him not having  Having to take over the game as much as people would think that you would have to rely on him. It was pretty interesting how I'm Sonia Michelle and James White and and Birkhead ended up like like really pulling the load during that game, but it was going back and forth for what I could see because the chief run again with no slouch either but again, like the costly penalty will see he said I think that with Eric very he wanted up doing that one. That was a really really crucial play and then just the fact that the the pages when the coin  I mean, what do you say? I mean, we already talked about we joke about you know, giving Tom Brady too much time any time like this under freaking two minutes is like, you know too much for him. But you you know, you win the coin toss and then like just went in that fashion like I mean, what else can you say? I mean, you can't really be super upset because I mean that's just that's just the luck of the draw because if you really want to finish some you should have tried to finish them before it even got to that point but it is what it is. I do agree.  That I never really liked the NFL's ruled for over time. I would like for both teams to get a chance, but that's just the way that it is, you know, that's the way it's been for a while. So I'm not really upset at the rules because again like and we'll get to the ramp in the Saints in a minute. But you know, you see that that happened the Saints ended up winning and they they got the ball first into ended up losing. So like I said you just at the end of the day you had to stop Tom Brady and the Patriots and the chief just couldn't do that and over time but this it is crazy though. They're both of those are they  FC and AFC Championship gatefold width of vote went to overtime and and you know, it ended up being two different outcomes at the end of the at the end of the day, but I mean, like I said, you know, you can't better get the Patriots. I always wanted to see us win like you said in the last podcast, but that just the way the cookie crumbles man Patriots are back and we get a chance to run it back now and they let him right there is what that was one common theme in both the games both wrote Ames one which is kind of rare in. Yeah. It was definitely interesting.  Very very interesting. I thought with the cheese being home and definitely would help them. But again to say quote unquote to say that the Patriots are anything but underdogs is truly ridiculous. I mean, technically yes, but I'm going to go back to what you guys are saying about the overtime rules. I acree. I've always been skeptical skeptical about it. I mean just seeing it and then hearing okay, like I can understand to innocence when it comes to field goals you would and it's of course if you're a kicker it's easier.  Are you to be able to once you hit the if you got a good kicker once you hit that 50-yard line and then you're going towards the opposition's goal and you're about to score and you kick a 35-year 35-yard field goal. It's easier essentially instead of throwing a touchdown or running a touchdown because you got to go through more men and everything along those lines. So the NFL saw it as okay. If you can make that easier point then we should give the opposite team that opportunity to make that easy point.  Or score a touchdown Which I didn't that's when it gets kind of. All right. Well, they can score a field goal. Why not you do the same thing for a touchdown to so I understand I hopefully they eventually change that but I highly doubt they will and then when it comes to the Patriots and the Chiefs game, I mean to be honest with you besides how the cheese plate towards the second half. Honestly, they killed themselves when they didn't do anything in the first half. I think that if they would have played the first half with some more conviction and actually would have  Ward I think they would have won this game. I definitely do think that I fully believe that I think that if they would have played the way how they did in the second half. And the first time they would have won that game but they didn't so the Patriots are in the Super Bowl for the third time in a row you guys and yeah, so let's go over to the controversial game the Rams and the Saints also another great game that also ended in  over time which has been a while since I think both NFC and AFC championship games have ended in a ended in overtime placards Yeah, man. So let's just get right into it. Honestly the first the first quarter belonged to the saints Saints with up dirty know I know JG was kind of a little nervous but then I was the scenario that I told you a g. Yeah, why is if they found themselves down like 14-0. What was your confidence level and sure enough? It was put to the test right away.  Absolutely, but the one thing I said that he needed to do was go off need to play and sure enough. He did. He definitely did he got an interception but he still went from 2025 out of 44 297 yards. So I mean one touchdown when an exception so he he definitely showed up - for sure but of course, I mean, it's Drew Brees. I mean what he's got is you Breeze, right? He's going to hundred he went for 26 442 test surrounds one interception. So, you know, you can't he's not slouch either. So it was definitely a  A good game. I mean they were actually going back and forth the entire time. I mean Saints had 13 points. The first quarter Rams came around and scored 10 points, then then they didn't score then score again into the third quarter both teams scored seven and then mean then the fourth quarter came around and then that's how we got to overtime and the Rams once. Oh, man, I I'm shocked. I know JG is not necessarily shocked. He's happy as hell but there's a lot of controversy going around this game not just over time, but  Is a lot of controversy and JJ's been offering a lot of smoke on social media. Yeah, he's going in after the game was over. He humbly said hey, you know, I'm happy for the the Rams that we made it he agreed that some of the calls were a little much when it comes to consider Rams and his Saints but the Saints are clearly not in the Super Bowl the Rams are well, let's just go ahead and get death. Good. God let you go to smoke.  The Gameboy get into that because I don't want you going to bring up all the other penalty. Yeah, because Ingram do much and Chimera did not do much on the ground. He did all your damage in the air. And yeah, I'll all of those dumped off to the right and to the left. He killed you.  The am I gonna hundred yards? But guess what? We stopped Michael Thomas. So that was also a big thing Michael Thomas did not do much. So we did our job there and they could not stop us in the air as much as you know, we thought was going to happen. Jerry golf actually showed up. He threw some grey passes particularly to Brandin Cooks when it mattered and he made it happen. Robert Woods has spectacular catches to so at the end of the day like Siggy said Jerry coughs showed up and he was mainly the reason why we won because  We had a little you know controversy there as well with our running game. CJ Anderson was in the majority of the time and people are still wondering like why is hi girly not blame Todd Gurley this for a touchdown. But what was like a 40-yarder like it was barely anything in Tiger lie still very much on the ground CJ angular 10 years or lose. I mean, he's like, yeah stretching the bike to so obviously he's still not healthy like we thought that something was up with him and he just what I said, that's what I said. There's no reason why you don't, you know star him and give him the majority of the  The workload even though we have CJ so CJ ended up taking over the game once again, and I'm like, okay what's going on now? Senor Anderson didn't do much but he did enough that you know, he made them a little scared on the ground. And then that's when Jerry coughing it up turn it up and that's when he did his thing but really it was you're a golfer with the star and I'm just again, I'm hoping because this is The Big Show now, so, you know anti girly still not a hundred percent. He better be and I'm hoping that he can start and still still carry the workload because we're really going to need him.  Is and I really hope they like he can actually damage because again, he would oh, I love CJ Anderson. I still would love that do it rain attacked that I still believe you and those only Michelle and James White and Burke had her good as a three-headed monster. I still believe they CJ Anderson who won the Super Bowl by the way, so he has experience and Todd Gurley. I mean freaking like the offensive MVP of last year and still like it one point in time. He was a leading touchdown touchdown person on the ground. I mean he still could do damage.  Still a threat and I still think that with those two people that we are better than the than the Patriots big three on the ground. So I just want to mention those things. I thought that I thought that it was great that we did up doing our job. We neutralize their running game. We measure Michael Thomas ain't do much. So that's what I want. So now we can get into the controversy free smoke free smoke. Go ahead JG brother. Let's go ahead and talk about it bro. Go and talk about the pass interference, but I go and talk about it. So again, I will never  Ever deny because that'll just be a Sonata me to ever deny that that wasn't a clear call whether you're asking parents or helmet to helmet which it was bold. It was like three of them. It was like what makes it worse is that wasn't the only controversial no isn't very that did he get called on Roll be combing? Because it was both our OB call me. That's the crazy thing because I agreed that both of those.  Should have been called. You said you're a greedy gu actually agree. Yeah, the way I saw social is social media about you. I thought you disagree to the way they're acting the Saints fans. I know right? I will actually told them what they wanted to hear. But just because I'm a Rams fan and I was happy they got upset and I don't know what I'm like, yeah. I'm like I can't do anything else like we're here the Super Bowl like I will say this for the major call that literary everybody's talking about they can't stop talking about  Out it still wasn't at the end of the day. It wasn't in the end zone. You could I mean you could go with what else but if if was a fifth like I don't know what else to say. There's no guarantee that he would have scored there. And I think that people are I think the people are literally like just disregarding it and they're just saying oh because of the call that the the Saints would have won. But again, that's not that's not a hundred percent certain. The probability would have went up all yeah, I think what it would it would have changed the  The dynamic of the game because they were forced to go for a field goal to the first guy. Right? So it's you know, what they're what they're you know thing is that it would have got him like what are the four five yard line? Whatever it was. Maybe three. I forgot and their probability would have been highly likely that it could have been a touchdown and then I would have made it to where you know, it's by, you know, four points if they get there some point it could have changed the game because then even the Rams win or they lose it at that point. It was not going to be a  Over time. Yeah boy. I want to I want to meet you one day before you where you say that no, it's not going great. No, I was gonna say but just like in the Patriots game though, everybody, you know was like, oh it wasn't it wasn't touched by element with those bet on very next play. Yeah, it was almost like ball don't lie. So, you know that call was wild too. By the way that the very next play could be easily could have been a fumble or Breeze could just missed a snap and you know, by the time, you know, it could have been a pick six or something right so we can never play the wood is exactly that.  It's why I'm trying to get people to just stop that because like let's not act like that was the only most controversial call ever that could have swayed the entire game like everybody refers to and I know you did Siggy the catch the Dez Bryant cares, right? The Cowboys would have went on like if that would happen that would have got called then they probably would have went on most likely the pages. Let's let's go on the Patriots bro. But um, but yeah, I mean the Patriots have been a part of so many things that they just deny deny deny.  And like we're just going to forget about all that. We're just going to say that because of this one call that we don't deserve it that just because it didn't get called. I understand to do was right there. The referee was right there Saints fans were so mad that they mistaken that dude for another player. Who is it who apparently paid for the Los Angeles Rams in like 1981 Vera and also played for the Falcons. I'm like, are you serious? Like matter of fact, I got it. Not only did y'all get it wrong, but y'all are so damn pet.  He did y'all not only attacked him but y'all attacked his son to which my girlfriend know who met me my fiance knows and she was like, wait a minute. Like why I'm saying is I was saying you're gonna kill him sending death threats and all this stuff. It's just ridiculous. We have a freaking petition that's been signed that they want the game to be played over like I'm 760 thousand signatures. It's so many thing. It just boggles my brain how like everybody is trying to get on us and I feel like it's overshadowing the  Because the Saints fans and and apparently everybody else or across America. They want this to be recalled. They wanted they wanted to do a do-over like literally the Super Bowl is this Sunday? It's not going to happen. And even if you're not having Friday and they gotta play Sunday like no that's it's not going down fam. That's not even realistic. So this isn't baseball where you just pick up a pair right exactly that's never happened before I've never seen a redo and if so, we can go back, you know plenty of years and we should redo those games.  To then how about that? Because I mean the best connections. Oh, absolutely. Let's talk about everything else that was missed in that game because the rest apparently were letting both of us play both teams played there were plenty of calls again. So there were actually two separate face mask cause that did not get called when she was wild clear if we was Jared golf one when he was hesitating. He actually ran it in but if he didn't hesitate  Tape that's waited up getting to to the controversy there with the face match that didn't get called. What if that would have got called we would have got a fresh set of downs. And guess what? We probably would have scored two. So again, we're talking about probabilities that never that might not ever happen. So again, we're just being petty because it was plenty of those that got called there were other Pi calls against against us, they weren't called either. So it was no cause on both sides. It would just a particular play that and  It up, you know getting everybody around up because that should have been a call like no matter what and I am like I am like y'all put it out. They did have the ball first in over time. We saw Tom Brady took care of it with them Drew Brees. Good evening. I'm Seth anger and did it yo, and we got an interception. So I mean it is what it is. And then we kick the 57 yarn here. And there we go. We going to the Super Bowls that he 7 and then when it didn't okay now this is another part don't agree with the role because public shit.  Toby sister happy like yep, I did it. He said he put them in on a on a waffle house. I'm like role be stopped talking. He admitted it. That's the crazy thing is Suits like after it happened. He admitted he said hell, yeah, I did it because I want on the score and he would like some time and I don't think that it that it's necessarily a good thing to say, but I understand why he said it he said like I did it because like I would rather get the penalty then then the him scored and  I'm like, okay, I understand that but you could have heard him at the end of the day because it was a helmet to helmet so it's like I agree but I also highly disagree at and what the actual play was and how you did it. It's like okay. I understand what you're trying to say it but not know. I've read moliro be easier talking big stuff Dave and I even like watch they are not watch but I've listened to a Bleacher Report thing where they were anyone Roby Coleman after it happened. He was talking about like his hats and stuff and how his mom died when he was going to  Halogen how how his child died, like five minutes after being born. So he would like, you know, I'm used to all this stuff. They were talking about the past and whatnot. And now like he doesn't care what anybody was saying because people were sending him death threats to saying they're going to kill him and all this the like just people being extra again. I understand you're upset, but that's just this super extra. So again, I understand everybody is mad about that call, but I just want to make clear that there have been a lot of no calls and any sport that have happened if you want to go back and do a redo on.  This one we should do a redoing everything because I would guarantee you the Patriots probably wouldn't have all these Super Bowls or other team. When have all these Super Bowl and then we get the Tuck Rule. They wouldn't even have been to a Super Bowl. So like let's let's go back if you want to be super Petty. But again, I want to make sure and I want to stress that that particular game the rest were clearly letting them play because it was a ton of calls that were not called. That's all I want to say. We going to the Super Bowl. I'm gonna be in Atlanta this weekend fuck everybody that man J GC Heap.  No, and by the way, speaking of the petition that has over seven hundred and sixty thousand I'm gonna give you the exact number seven hundred and sixty thousand five hundred and sixty two signatures y'all and guess when the game was supposed to be played. Guess what January 27th yesterday at the time of the recording? Oh, right, right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah the time of recording. It was supposed to be played January 27th when I went  Hurry up when the Pro Bowl was going on. So pretty much whether so pretty much what they expected to happen is those players that if they went on to the Pro Bowl and everything like that, they were supposed to not be in Florida. They're supposed to go back to New Orleans and they were supposed to play the game and they were supposed to Duke it out from there. And then the winner will go to the Super Bowl and then that's where it's supposed to happen. Now the killer now the commissioner does have the power to overturn something like that from any extraneous situation or a strenuous.  All but he ain't gonna do that shit. Let's be real God ain't gonna happen. All they did was find Roby. That's it. I fine after the fact a fine. That's it. Nothing else a fine and that was because of the helmet to helmet. Your ain't the least worst of the least thing that happened. That's why I'll now y'all social media all y'all Saints fans are so-called saying fans acting fake mad and outrage. It's one thing to go get on a on a social media.  An outburst and be upset and everything like that be upset because the game completely fine but sending death threats to people because of that never is never called for and yeah, you're gonna of course if you see surround fans, you know what you could be mad at them and everything like that rich cultural Diego man that your true but the thing is though if it's one thing if the Rams Fans are saying no after that there was never a penalty did it at all it was clear as day. It was a penalty there was a lot of clear penalties for sure, but for you to say sent death threats and you want to beat people  This stuff like that like grow the fuck up. Like that's not how life Works they dug up information on all those reps. Yeah, all living in la-la land all that. I was like, oh that's what I'll have like everything. I've got all the evidence. I did all the DNA testing all they already in Heritage. They know who their great great uncle is right. That's a wrap again. Like that's wildly. They legit went through all that paperwork and everything like that to find out where all the rest lives they were like, oh, they only count  Vojta, they got ties to La it was a fix to fix was in all of that. That shit is wild. Imagine if you guys would use that all that stuff that you guys try to do and everything like that to something productive. Imagine imagine if things that you would do for your career for your health for your family, all of that that's wild grow the fuck up right? I don't have any any remorse or sympathy towards towards Saints fans. I just saying that you know, yeah I had to Legacy Katrina was was the  Nothing, but Katrina is over yard you want y'all Super Bowl in the last 10 years. So yeah, I can go on with that mess. I'm not trying to hear it eat anything. I read all the comments are. Definitely Repo Man here brick. I could be Petty and salty right back. All right, you can yes, you can use that. You gotta try to drive down to La like he would say they actually did because I remember whenever they started the playoffs it was a whole bunch, but the fire stuff  Like that. So yeah, we also clean off that they could that's the whole reason why my homie when we had the Chiefs game because he was already mad that we love getting, you know home field advantage after the at the New Mexico City debacle was a field. Yeah. They were like on your they're playing on the firefighters in the wildfires the out deaths in the way that all like if it's not one thing it's another so like everybody just needs to chill out. I understand like I've dealt with the struggle that is the Rams in st. Louis.  I've dealt with Jeff Fisher. I dealt with Steve's back Nola. I've dealt with the 50 million dollar man, Sam Bradford. I've dealt with all of that stuff man. I dealt with like everything after the greatest show on Turf. So you did your time. Yeah, that's right. That's exactly what he said. He did his time. You take my happiness away from me that we are going to Super Bowl I wouldn't even  Imagine that we would go to the football after the second year which are McVeigh. We went to the play all gonna coach ever do it. Yeah. I lost it the first year this time we end up going all the way and again like this is what we been on everything in the offseason. I was like yo and I think you said it to singing other people say that too if we don't go to the Super Bowl we called it. We called it. We spent all this money and we got the perfect team now, so we deserve it. I didn't think we're going to honor a religious go this far, but we did so you can't take my happiness away from me and  Again Saints. Yeah, I really want to go to Atlanta. Not this year. Y'all don't want to go to Atlanta. They would have more than earned it there would have been like a ton of fights there. I'm sorry, but we saved y'all. So JG middle of tell Lana will all the smoke on meat will all the rappers and everything like that and talk your shit and link up with black and everything like that. He won't all the smoke to all the saints fan free smoke free smoke but JG are you prepared to defend?  Your Rams if the if you guys let the New England Patriots win cuz you know they coming for that ass if they lose you know that right. I'm yeah, I know. I know I hope you ready. I hope you got your memes and all that ready boys because they are gunning for you to go the second. The game is over. Yeah, just another day for is what we won another championship Tom Brady gonna keep playing until he 45 saw that I'm prepared for all of that and I just hope that we can once again  I'm sat down. I'm not trying to have Tom Brady though for 500 yards though. They're just ridiculous. But if that happens, yeah, I don't want any of that crap happening, but I'm prepared it better not be no blowout either. I swear to God. I just thought LOL GG. No, I highly doubt it I leave and they pick y'all defense like that bro. Oh my God. I don't be it's going to be a chess match though. I'll tell you that for sure. Oh, absolutely you just matching. I would love to see Shawn McVeigh find a way to out with Bill Belichick, and I guess I don't know if you want.  Segway the like the Super Bowl. Yeah, we need to say we're right to it. So I mean we asking JG we know who he's going for City. Who are you going for a bro? Well, I'm going for the Rams. The thing is why though why are you going for the Rams? Because I'm tired of the pigeons. Okay always not want them to win. I appreciate what Tom Brady and the pictures of done all these years, you know archive.  I can stand still sit back and be like, okay. Yeah, that's pretty definitely Dynasty. But I mean, yeah, I just want them. I want them to lose. I'm always want the Hawks lost to them. I don't even like the Seahawks like that. I hated that the that was their faces lost to them the few years ago the Rams and I mean the Eagles when we when it was done with Navin toi which they won. I mean it was there's a whole bunch of times. I wish the Patriots for the lost. The only times I was happy was whenever the Giants probably did twice finally they say twice  And to be honest with those symbols are always my favorite just because of how they not only that they lost but how they've lost it was like, all right, only somebody miraculously beat them with some miracle play Eli Manning is a Time Eli Manning will forever be the Tom Brady killer always no matter what that's the that's the one Legacy that he will always have no matter where he goes later on in life. He will always be the Thomas. Yeah exactly. He will be to consider the Tom Brady and Patriots killer because once the Giants got there they won.  Won both times know and that's what New Yorkers use over the Patriots fans all the time. So yeah, it's always like that my but I do want the rest away now being realistic little looking at the game. I know that this was also game that that was high school. Was it 53 5050 for but you know what it was. I know the Rams did when that one the first time right? Well, you don't want this here. Yeah. Now we didn't face the Patriots year who was all that was against you so much. Yeah, they are the  The Patriots though in this game against the Rams they faced the Chiefs already. So they're not scared of golf like like, you know, whenever I was past weekend was talking about was talking about Breeze and I need that the Saints the to be the same as golf need to show up golf can show up in this game against the Patriots and that wouldn't matter and because the one thing we do know is that Mahomes and that Chiefs offense in my opinion. I know probably  not to Jake he's a pain is better than the Rams now now maybe earlier in the season when they were both scoring a whole bunch of points. That's what I thought about the 54 year because we were playing against each other that you know, that that that Golf and that Mahomes, you know, that would have been scary but they're not playing like that right now, you know the ramps now he did show up. It was still not like I thought he wouldn't I wanted the 400-yard golf to show up. We got 300 yard golf, but in order for them to beat the Patriots, we need a 350 400 yard go.  And I just don't see that in the thing is if girly is not healthy like we saw that he wasn't he was on his bike the whole time and look if he still like that after all this time, then there's just no way I see the Rams beating the Patriots and it's not because of lack of trying and stuff like that think the games can be close. It's just that the Chiefs threw everything at the Patriots and it still wasn't enough in the end and it didn't even look like Tom Brady like we talked about here.  Have to do much it even look like they really tried like they after they jumped out and you know ahead they kind of coasted and I'm afraid that that would happen and and against this team, you know, the Rams if they ramps like we talked about they were down 14-0 that was going to prom they were down 13-0 and it got to the point to where it was still they still won the game, but it was a struggle just to get to that point. Now their defense kept them in the game the whole time. I don't know if that defense can hold the Patriots offense like that because yeah, that's the three usually something 300 bags.  Then all of a sudden it's like oh hey, by the way, I'm Tom Brady even had his Edelman, right exactly that little fears or small bastard just gets everywhere. Right and that's annoying but he can't be stopped bro. It's annoying. And that's the thing that they haven't even told the used was 50% of their playbook. It seemed against the Chiefs and they really pull it all there, you know all the tricks and they just saved it down was carrying over to the ramp. So that's the reason why I have a feeling that the patron swim I do. Hope the rims win big. I don't like this man get a six ring bro. Oh,  Oh my God, Tom Brady on talking shit bro. He gonna be at the ring ceremony have a handful of Super Bowl rings and then get another one in stone bro. That shit gonna be wild and gonna be in the picture like this on and make some in the camera. Like this is the she's gonna be wild bro. Oh my God. Oh my God. That's why I do think that the pictures win. I hope I'm wrong. And this is one of those situations like last week. I will I hope I was wrong and sure enough. I was in the rap game and but I was wrong on the Chiefs. Oh for sure.  But yeah, I don't know man. I'm rooting for you. JG. I just don't know right and I myself I'm going for the Rams. I got to especially for the fact is like, you know now now they are LA's team at the moment because you know the Chargers, you know being the Chargers fuck. So yeah, I'm definitely going with the Rams but city does make it a brilliant point. In fact as I mean Patriots if they are going to stop if the Patriots get the Run game stop. Don't worry. They got a little bastard AKA Edelman that's gonna  Just and Tom Brady's going to literally pick your defense apart and the defense of really defense and the offense for the Rams are going to be a test at the test right now. I mean honestly coming into the game. I have the Patriots are definitely the front-runner. I do believe that the ram to the underdog. I mean regardless, this is a dynasty that they are going against but this could be the ending of the Patriot and Tom Brady and Bill Belichick's Dynasty with a loss here which evidently  Enough started with the Rams so many years ago. So it is actually it's a perfect setup. Now if the Rams do win then I see that the Patriots are going to start tumbling down. I truly believe is going to be the end of the dynasty. I did I do think so. I definitely do think Tom Brady has a couple of more years in him. They'll check definitely has a few years in him and then it's going to go down from there. But if JG and the  same time we can see the st. Louis Rams if JG and the Los Angeles Rams don't win this game. They are going to be the sole reasons why Tom Brady's getting a seventh ring and a 3 & A 9 3 and we're going to blame the Rams and we're gonna blame you th Jay cheated on. All right, wait for me. Hey Rafi, y'all win together. Y'all lose together man rims rims for one bro. I had to deal with my loss with the charges. See you gotta continue go down with that headache with the  A jet and fly got to deal with the Baltimore Ravens. So brave you lose what your team is y'all fault? It's your fault niggas. Yep, interesting. Okay. So what do you think that I mean? We know you're going for your abs. It's like and what do you think what he gonna take it Patriots and thankfully no. No, but I'm as far as how do you think the game is gonna flow what he did not know you said that you think that the key is going to be girly you think he's so healthy you think after these two weeks. I mean, how can only hope so but  I actually don't think that he's going to be a hundred percent. I'm a citizen. I heard that you don't think yeah, I don't think he's going to be a hundred percent. But I think that especially after what happened during the Saints game energy Championship. I think that Sean McVeigh is going to run him more. I think he just going to be more confident. He's going to have to say he's about to tough it out and then they do want to tough it out again. I don't mind CJ Anderson like starting all being the front back but tiger lead F needs to be the  EP that we need to to give as a patriot. I'm I'm actually a little bit scared. I'm not gonna lie. I'm really scared of the Patriots because now their grand kids showed back up. He's deathly that fact that I'm just like bro. Like what are we gonna do who we going to put on him? A lot of people are saying we're probably going to keep to leave on them. But I mean really nobody can guard him don't like big dude bro. Well, I started guard he's gonna run over everybody and then we got Edelman obviously.  Who's going on their way there sets been showing up to for them randomly. Yeah, because you know, you need somebody else's Chris Hogan a really big doing what she's supposed to, you know, I've been doing way better because the last year but he still hadn't really showed up. So somebody else has to is that is that you know technical second wide receiver, but he's just gonna die already. Nobody's gonna be dumping onto James White all the time. We gotta make sure that we limits only Michelle though because this kid, oh my Lord like I'm just going to hope that like, hi, girly and Sony Michelle were like talking to each other and tiger like, you know, I'm a  Oh are rightly so, you know anywhere you go they both Georgia Boy they were right today, you know, they were in the they were actually at school together. And Tony Michelle was actually a second. I think he was a second or third running back behind what's up? Everybody came on it with the ramp. So then under they got the little camaraderie there, but I'm hoping he talking like big shit to him. Like no, you're not going to get this Championship. Homeboys gonna be mine. I'm gonna get one before you so I'm actually very very afraid of Tony Michelle. I'm hoping that like because I don't know.  If ya'll watching the game and that man was breaking off for like big junkyard. Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. It's been suspect the entire season our secondary ended up being more suspect when the keep to he got hurt. Um, when once he came back, you know the stats don't lie. We definitely have to do a lot better but I run defense is still very suspect, but I do have hope though because we did limit the Saints running at  And I was really more scared of they're running attack than the Patriots but it's now the Patriots have three people compared to 2. So again, we can do anything but I know the one thing I ask you two things that we need to do is I think that we need to blips early and often we need to make sure they either Donald or Sue can get off of these because they're not going to be able to double team both of these guys every single play. So one of them needs to definitely eat and make Tom Brady nervous. You need to hurry him like every single time and we need to we need to make sure that  He cannot make these decent little dump all passes into seconds. We need to figure out what's going on. We also do not need to be planned Zone. I know that they want to but we need to make sure that there are men on Edelman and Gronk all times. Absolutely. I'm not trying to have a charger situation because they do we got eight up that game and it was it was terrible. It was absolutely terrible. So I'm hoping that Sean McVeigh that we can get that going man, cuz I really don't want the same thing.  Happen I think that if we can stick to that game plan and we can make Tom Brady nervous almost every single play and stop rushing like only three people at don't touch the shoulder week. Yeah, that's right you go get it boy. We could do that. Then I think that we will have a chance and I honestly still think there are offensive core it's better but the Patriots are physical or even without Josh Gordon is no slouch so it's going to be a struggle for sure, but I'm just hoping to like we can limit those dump All Passes for good.  Junkyard is I'm hoping that we can limits only Michelle and then entire Patriots Run game and I'm hoping that we can like hold Edelman and Grand to a minimum because if we can do it Michael Thomas and that we can limit, um Chimera and Ingram then I think that we do have a shot against the Patriots.  Okay. Okay.

Kurkjian Fran fraschilla Ian Begley whole bunch of awesome guests all around basketball this episode. I'm going to try to do a two-minute take on just about every team in the league through two games, which every team has at least played by now two minutes two games. Perfect. Nice.  Concise quick takes on every team. If you only care about your team. I'm going in order on the standings right now starting with the Eastern Conference. So pretty easy to figure out starts with the Lana ends with Sacramento all the way through the NBA really appreciate you guys listening and without further Ado. Let's check out my thoughts on the leak so far.  All right starting with Atlanta to know start impressive obviously question. Will it be sustainable Trey young is having a score nearly 40 every game. I know Kevin herders still working his way back from injury, you know, he's obviously far from a hundred percent. My question with Atlanta has just been basically the depth issue. They don't really have a backup point guard. They're really thin camera. Reddish hasn't been really good. DeAndre Hunters been. Okay, you know, I think he's a solid  Roll player, but you know unless Kevin herders is Klay Thompson, then you know, I think they have a superstar in tray young and then they have a couple decent role players, but I think their bench just isn't very good Jabbar. He's been a pleasant surprise. I will say that he's got himself in shape and as plain as active rolling five man, you know, really diving hard finishing strong at The Rim that's been good to see you know, I just think they basically  Need trade ask or 35-40 every night to win games. And you know, I think that's going to be hard to sustain as great as he is and you know, he is he's very great. But you know, I still wouldn't make a huge just meant I said 33 wins, you know, I still think they hover around that Philadelphia has started well to know their issue also to me I think is depth related. You know, you see Brett Brown playing a whole bunch of  backup point guards Off the Bench which shows me he doesn't really believe all that strongly in any any single one just yet. You know Josh Richardson's played. Well, I like, you know, how he can kind of handle it as a backup point guard a little bit when Simmons out of the game-winning with Adam bead obviously was was pretty impressive, you know, the rookie Matisse has really good Defender and is played well, but again, I just think they  I know that they have a really good starting five, but they do have some fit issues obviously and have to figure out who they want to finish close games with, you know as playing that such a big lineup at the end of a game can pose a challenge. So I'm still you know, I still think people are way too high on them. I don't think they're in the same tier as I say Milwaukee. I think they're in that second tier, you know with  With Miami potentially with Austin potentially, you know, I think they're really good, but I'm not overreacting to two wins to start the season for them Boston two and one been really impressed with them. You know, Kemba obviously is great and fits in great as a brad Stevens type player. I think they're back, you know, trying to re-establish an identity as a greedy, too.  Nosed defensive team and you know in their two wins, they held the Raptors to 106 the next 295. You know, Philly they lost to Philly opening night gave up 107 but I think they're going to be a team that that you know hang their hat on defense. I think obviously they have a whole lot of bodies and and Williams and you know, semi and Jalen Brown Tatum Marcus Smart, obviously, you know, Grant Williams bunch of guys with that kind of  Mindset and identity I think you know the issue obviously is just the Five Spot pretty pretty darn thin there, especially when canners out I liked ice but he's ideally you know it a 15-minute a game guy. You know, I think if they could send my trade for for a really solid five or find somebody out there at least until Robert Williams is really ready to step up, you know might limit them a little bit but I  You think you know think it really surprised a lot of people this season I think 50 wins or something around that, you know isn't out of the question. I think like I said, I think they're at that top tier of the East and I think Brad Stevens is a terrific coach Toronto starting 2 and 1/2 really good wins against the Pelicans and bowls siakam is a stud. I did a YouTube video If you haven't seen I think  He's going to get MVP votes this season. I think he's he's a poor man's yanis he but he can shoot too. He can post up he can dribble the ball full core. You can pass, you know, he's got some moves off the dribble. He can roll he can handle and pick-and-rolls. He's got a whole bunch of stuff to his game Fred Van Fleet is has made another leap. He's just so funny.  Only solid and has improved so much in this time in the league just such a worker, you know, so I might have underestimated them. I said they weren't going to make the playoffs. I still think, you know, unless siakam. Like I said can really take that leap to an MVP guy the season, you know, they're they're going to have some nights where they really struggle, you know to score a hundred six against Boston. I think they're going to have some some down scoring nights they again,  Then don't have a ton of depth Nick nurse clearly. He's not happy with with their offseason acquisitions and hollis-jefferson and Stanley Johnson, but you know, they do still have a really solid at least core five starting five and you know siakam can score 25 30 if OG can continue to play well and you know really make an improvement all offensively, you know, then for sure they'll stay around the the top of the East  But you know, I do think they need a little more at least scoring help for sure. Miami has been awesome to watch without even without Jimmy. I love I love bam. I love Tyler here. Oh, I love Kendrick none as a rookie if you haven't seen him yet. Make sure you check him out. He's got a tremendous amount of confidence, you know Big Time shooter big-time floater. I love how they have.  Olynyk and Leonard are there stretch bigs? They have Derek Jones and Bam to dive, you know, they keep the floor space with one of those stretch bigs the other big roles hard every single time, you know, they surround it with Justice handling some they surround it with Goron Off the Bench as been terrific, you know, he's been around so long and his hidden shots really really well.  When they get obviously their Max guy back in Jimmy, I think he'll fit in perfectly and be a perfect so player hopefully James Johnson, maybe Dion if he doesn't mess things up can can give them something this year off the bench. You know, I think Duncan Robinson's a pleasant surprise. He's he looks like an NBA player. I mean, he's a good piece Off the Bench can move around all screens. Shoot really good.  I work really fundamentally sound Miami, you know, they really defend the gritty and that's how I spoke coaches, you know, a lot of guys with a chip on their shoulder, you know, holding it down again until until Jimmy's back and then I think he really gets them over the hump, but they even without him. I mean they've got a team that's really fun to watch, you know, just wonder you know how exactly the rotation changes it's hard, you know when you start to and one and have some really good.  Names and then have to integrate back on your star. You know, does that mean you know Meyers Leonard, I guess probably goes to the bench. But you know, like I said suppose had a good thing going with playing one of Leonard or Olynyk at all times keeping the floor space that way, you know, so it is a new challenge when Jimmy comes back but I would think they'll be able to work come in just fine Cleveland beating Indiana shocked me. You know I said, I think they might win.  In 10 15 games that I thought they're going to be really really bad this season, but it's a good reminder that you know, they still have some adults in the room, you know in love and Thompson's been balling out so far Matthew dellavedova, you know, John Henson, they have guys who've been around. I really like Darius Garland as a rookie, you know Sextons played pretty well, you know, but I think they'll hang around maybe the best case for there.  Front office is to hang around and look pretty good in the first 10 15 games and you know, then I think maybe you can attract some trade value for your vets and you know, get some more assets and young pieces. I still think as a whole they'll be pretty terrible. But you know Garland is a great piece and you know, obviously love is still a really high level player and kind of sets the tone for the young guys and yeah the wind  Randy was impressive but I you know, they've got a tough schedule coming up might be a while before they get that next one Orlando 101. Markel folks has been awesome to watch, you know, really cool seeing him play with a whole bunch of confidence again, you know attacking hard not being afraid to take a mid-range or even a three, you know, when he's left wide open, you know playing really really hard defensively.  using that set the tone playing with great Pace offense ively pushing the ball attacking the basket, you know, obviously they've got a whole bunch of wingspan guys, I think for me though, you know, my biggest takeaway is I need more out of Aaron Gordon especially games like Atlanta which they lost you know, he's he needs to be a 20 25 a game guy this season, you know, I just know he's been he's been good overall is analytics or solid he's certainly  Good player in the league but every time I watch him, I just come away thinking there's there's something more, you know, there's there's a whole bunch of talent and I always think there's there's a little bit more that you know can be pulled out of him. You know, he's had a pretty very quiet start to this season and you know who bounced back but I need to see him more in an attack mindset killer mentality, you know, he needs to be there. They're  Guy on a lot of nights and I think he kind of has a tendency to defer and let you know they've got Fournier. They've got vouched. I've got Isaac, you know, they've got pieces but I think for them to be their best version Aaron Gordon needs to be you know, not only just a solid to way guys. I think he needs to take a step up all fensively really get going Milwaukee lost to Miami at home was really disappointing. They really blew that.  Game choke that game away. Also disappointing to me is just seeing them not really change how they're playing at all. They're still really really predictable. You know, they play that five outset pretty much every time they don't run hardly any plays, you know, makes it really easy just to load up Miami just got basically, you know Five Guys in the paint and showed Jana so wall and you know, he  Rove when he could kicked it out to spot Shooters when he could but they just you know, Wes Matthews Brook. Even Robin now just Chuck's threes George Hill, you know, they just space the floor and honest Clauses Forces help kicks out for three is don't run any other sets allergic to taking mid-range jumpers and I think they're just predictable, you know, there's still like I said, they'll be the best team in the East I think, you know, I  This is that good but I think they need to change up how they play a little bit the same way Houston gets that criticism for being easy to guard and just you know playing that that same way every single time. I think, you know, they need to execute be able to run some things and not just rely on yanis getting the pain every time and kicking out the shooters Wes Matthews took some some really wild shots. Robin did like I  Said, you know, I think they they need to switch up the style a little bit, but, you know watching you honest.  You know, he's not he's not shooting the ball very well just two games obviously, but you know, I still just you know, I don't really like that. He's taking a whole bunch of Threes. I'd like to see him, you know dribbling occasionally Rise Up from the elbows Elevate over guys, which he obviously can do. You know, I think they're they're playing hardcore analytic ball over will work to an extent especially in the regular season, but is it good enough to  To get you over the hump in the playoffs remains to be seen Kyle Korver has been really good for them. You know how he they were able to slide him in there. So cheap was was a great find he's a but player he still can shoot the heck out of it. You know, they have a pretty deep team. I need to see a little more from you know, Dante T Vincenzo, you know Sterling Brown some of the young guys Pat connaughton. I  I think you know some of those guys can still step up and make a little leap and you know blowing that game to Miami was was not good. But I think they'll they'll start to see some really strong Charlotte. Obviously guy. Everybody's been talking about PJ Washington shooting the absolute heck out of the bowl, you know miles Bridges has been good Dwayne Bacon's had good moments, you know, I think Borrego has them as I'm  Think hard, you know, they're super super hyung team. I can't believe bismack biyombo. I every offseason forget. He's still in the NBA and then I see he, you know started a game for them. You know, I think yeah, there's going to be a whole bunch of growing pains. They might only win 10 15 games when it's all said and done but Bridges has improved PJ's really solid, you know.  Terry I've said I'm high on Devonte Graham obviously had a huge first game Off the Bench, you know, so maybe they surprised sorry second game for gram. Maybe they surprise a few people myself included. But yeah, I think overall, you know vets win in this league. They don't have enough of them, you know with with Batum and you know, mkg, you know Rosie tomorrow.  Williams they have a couple guys but you know the focal points of that team or their youth you know, which they have to rely way too much on at this point in their career. So it's obviously developmental year for Charlotte. You know, I think you just need to figure out who can really play who's going to be a really good piece. You know, they have a lot of those guys have a lot of confidence. So, you know, I their NBA players don't expect them to back down.  down from anybody, you know when you have guys that believe in themselves as much as regehr does and you know, Washington does and bridges clearly, you know, all those guys, you know, they'll be competitive in some games but macro big picture probably not going to go as well Chicago one and two hasn't had a phenomenal start, you know fans are freaking out shouldn't have lost that game in  Our let's open the season, you know Toronto still a really good team obviously, but they, you know could have been a lot more competitive in that game. You know, I think they're seeing the the reasons that I ran ski why there was even a starting point guard competition was set around see solid, but he just he loses his confidence in his shot a lot and that's happened, you know a lot so far through three games, you know, I think  Market in is spin up and down and struggling like a young player does you know hasn't found the consistency that he needs every night. Kristen's been good Off the Bench, you know playing his role really defending obviously doesn't do much scoring Colby white does some scoring doesn't do some so much passing, you know, so it's just an imperfect team the with a lot of guys who you know, I think don't know exactly what their roles are just yet. You know, I think boy  One, like I said, I've been a fan of his and I think he's done a good job getting them to play harder and try to establish an identity as defensive team. But yeah, you know that requires then guys understand that the Levine and Market in an auto or the main guys all offensively and you know Kobe obviously Off the Bench and everybody else, you know has to really buy into being a Defender and doing their job and you know letting those guys go to work offensive.  Ali you know, haven't that young is the adults in the room and a couple of the other, you know Arch and auto obviously the Vets will be good for them. So, you know way too early to overreact on Chicago. I think they'll be just fine. I think they'll you know compete for that eight seed which is all all you can ask at this stage in their development. So fans can can take a deep breath and I think they'll they'll be all right.  And right there in the long run Brooklyn one and two not good enough, you know losing to Memphis not really acceptable, you know, losing a Minnesota. They look a lot better but probably shouldn't have lost that game at home either to open the season, you know, and to me I get all these these Kyrie stands furious at me for posting a single clip of him.  You know not being good defensively with a minute 30 left in overtime and people say now post the clips of you know him playing great defense after that which he played good defense after that or you know, you're nitpicking you're you're doing what people did about LeBron know to me. I think people tried to paint Lebron as a poor Defender went a lot of times. They didn't even understand what was going on in the clips or how the clips weren't really LeBrons fault, you know,  Somebody else didn't do their job, you know, Kyrie obviously is we know he can score the ball. He's continued to do a phenomenal job of that, you know, but the question is is he going to Bear down and make winning plays and in overtime 1:30 left up to rough three, whatever was you know, just flying a poor shooting Solomon Hill off the three-point line and you know,  No, just just jumping for no reason and giving no effort to get back in. The play isn't good enough. It just isn't a winning play, you know, and that was kind of that was an issue obviously in Boston and in the playoffs in particular and you know, if you're going to be the guy if you're going to have the house of highlights and bleacher report's freak out every single time. You have a nice dribbling move and finish up the basket. You need to remember the  Leti that comes with with being a superstar the max guy requires you to be a two-way player and to do it on both ends night in night out, you know until obviously KD maybe next season gets back. They need Kyrie data set the tone and be a leader and that's just not what leaders do you know? So yes, he's done a great job scoring like he always always has he looks really good on that end, but  I need to see Kyrie give more effort on the defensive end for me to really really by what Brooklyn's doing. So Detroit one and two obviously been missing Blake. You know, Derrick Rose is still looks like he's found that magical Fountain of Youth Off the Bench, you know, he's I think people get mad why he's not starting at times. But you know if you can only do it for 20  Five minutes, it's hard to start a guy like that. I think he's comfortable in his role Off. The Bench. Tim Frazier is is not a good starting point guard at all or really a point guard even kind of worthy of a roster spot in my opinion. I feel like they'll look to do better than that if Reggie or anybody has to miss extended time, but you know canards been going good Off the Bench, you know Snell is  This is up and down as he always is Andre I think is has looked like a much more committed player. So far Bruce Brown is a gritty guy. I'd like, you know in that lineup is going to really defend, you know, I think they have the pieces around Blake to really surprise some people this year and you know when 45 or 50 or so, I think case he's a really good coach, you know, so they just they need to get  Of the we need to stay together Reggie when watching a little Reggie Jackson II think he's in good shape this year. I think he you know has been much maligned obviously and probably rightfully so at times, you know, but watching him in the preseason, I think he's you know, Casey's got him a little more bought in he's she looks like he's really playing defense. He's playing hard, you know, obviously making shots and  giving them something offensively as more the question mark, but yeah, I think Christian Wood is really exciting Off the Bench. He plays really hard and just super freakishly talented. So still really high on Detroit obviously need Blake to get back. But yeah, the they'll be they'll be solid this year the Wizards won in Sioux, you know bread obviously is the guy andrewy has really impressed me.  Burton's shoots the living crap out of the bowl Isaiah had a good game off the bench that was good to see Thomas Brian's a lot better than a lot of people realize, you know, the again, they're competitive. It's just you know, they might only be eight or nine deep, you know, Bongos has had some good moments, but he's just not not a starting three, you know, I think they're having to rely at unruly and he's been really  Good. Like I said, he's a lot better than people thought he absolutely can defend. He's really solid in the mid-range. He's even proven that he can he can make some threes. He plays hard he rebounds he runs the floor. He's got a good IQ to me. You know, I think yeah, it's just it's a really thin team, you know, they lack second Superstar at least for now, you know and bread can only  Only take them so far but they've been competitive and you know, I Brad is he's a he's a competitor. That's what he's gonna do for them every night. As long as he's playing he's going to go out there and give his all and compete and be one of the best two-way players in the league, you know, really work on defense run some offense obviously through him handling the ball, you know, obviously shooting. He's he always starts assist the season a little cold, but he'll really  we warm up and get going. So yeah, you know the Wizards it's going to be a long year for them. But rui is a really good piece Thomas Brian's looking like a really good piece, you know, the it's about figuring out who who was part of that that team next year with John hopefully back and Brad, you know and Thomas Bryant rui, you know, that's a solid four right there who else can complement that as a starter off the bench figuring out.  The three position sign mellow maybe, you know, they've got some things to figure out but an encouraging start to the season not encouraging the Pacers, you know, really struggled losing to in Cleveland not good, you know, obviously they need all the depot to come back before a lot of people thought he would you know not yeah, I might maybe I've been too high on them. You know, I  I still really like Brogdon there. I like sabonis and Turner, even though they you know still don't seem to really know perfectly how to how to play together TJ McConnell, you know didn't do much in the last game and leaf kind of still doesn't seem to figure it out. You know, they need a lot of guys to step up. You know, Mike D'Antoni old quote. Somebody nobody knows has to ask  Step up today or shine today or something like that. You know, they have a lot of guys who haven't really made a big name for themselves in the league yet Off the Bench Sumner starting at times, you know, they yeah, it's going to be hold down the fort until Vic gets back. But you know looking coming up. They've got the Troy Brooklyn Cleveland Chicago Charlotte the Wizards plenty of time to to turn it around and you know,  I'd say at least hover, you know be around 500. Hopefully Vic comes back, you know again earlier than people thought couple months less maybe if he doesn't, you know, then it's scratch and Claw just for a playoff spot, but I do think with him, you know with him with Warren with lamb Brogdon, you know with the bigs. I think they're you know as deep of a team as a lot of teams.  Yeast I think their gritty I like Nate as a coach a lot. And yeah, I think still really early but the got up got to find a way to get some wins like the Knicks. Oh and three to start, you know, Boston not super competitive Brooklyn. They were competitive Spurs, you know, hung around for a decent portion of the game, you know physics has them competing. But yeah now we've gotta turn that into  some wins RJ obviously as been as been really good, you know, that's very encouraging to see because work with your handle and I think clearly paying off Drew's one of the best development coaches in the league RJ's, you know shot that has been a lot better than people thought it would be at this point, you know Randall as been good. I think, you know the issue just remains that they don't really have a point guard.  You know Alfred is is a Defender and doesn't things and you know, Dennis obviously was going through the personal thing I guess but you know just just didn't really give them anything and Frank fact that they still won't throw them out there. I think just again confirms that the Fizz just has no trust in him. And you know, I think again, he just doesn't see Frank being able to make shots and you know to handle the pressures of being appointed.  Gar, when teams go under every single screen you have to make them pay by making some shots and you know, obviously if Alfred and Dennis continue to not do that either, you know, then Frank's going to have to get his shot by necessity. But yeah, it's pretty amazing. They have three, you know young guys were all high picks and have a ton of potential in this league. But you know right now it just doesn't seem like they really have any NBA starting point guard.  Makes it really hard to win games. Despite. Despite how well RJ plays. It's like Marcus Morris playing pretty well, despite Mitch, you know giving them good minutes. So, you know, they've been grittier. But again you can you make that leap to figuring out how to win games. Oh and three not a good start looking coming up Chicago Orlando Boston Sacramento Detroit Dallas, you know, it's there.  Is winnable games there got it. Got to find a way to sneak some in there, especially the close ones because the next thing you know, you know, you'll be 2 and 14 or 15 again and you know, the things will be despondent pretty quickly got to turn around speaking of turnarounds, Minnesota or Ryan Saunders done a great great job starts season, that is a fun team to watch if you haven't yet check them out lead pass wherever you can.  You know the Boston last night against Miami Miami team who I talked about and love, you know cat bold out in the first half Wiggins balled out in the second half was way too early to write him off despite his inefficiency despite his struggles, you know, he's super young earned the max contract for a reason still a tremendous amount of talent there. I tried Graham plays great defense of kogi plays great defense.  Since Covington plays great defense and hits threes. You know Layman's decent Off the Bench Napier's decent Off the Bench Von Lisbon. I don't understand how the Knicks why the next just let him go. You know, they said they you know, they have cat obviously as the guy offensively, you know, I think they have to figure out if Wiggins can still kind of be that that second guy, but you know, I like Covington obviously is has huge.  Angel is defensive player of the year type guy, you know grams really gritty and you know, like I said the guys off the bench Ryan Saunders has everybody really understanding their role guys know the offense going to be through cat. Andrew will get his when he can you know other guys T groans A Team a little bit cause of me, you know hit shots Shabazz can come in be aggressive Off the Bench, but you know, they know everybody seems to understand what's expected.  The them Culver hasn't been great, you know, but he's had some good moments. He's had some flashes. You know, I think talk again in 10 15 games about him. Give him a little time. He's he's very raw obviously, but you know still still really high on him. And yeah, I think Minnesota I certainly could have been wrong about them. Especially if Wiggins, you know continues to really give them something then  Yeah. Yeah, I think Minnesota can absolutely compete for a playoff spot. This season towns couldn't compete for an MVP if he keeps this up and yeah, I think you know, they have the right right amount of defensive players around cat this season to make things a lot easier for him. San Antonio continues to be as well coached as ever maybe the best, you know, well definitely the best all-time in the league.  You know beat the Knicks the Wizards gets a lot tougher from here Portland Clippers. You know, how do you do in those ones remains to be seen But Murray looks great plays with phenomenal Pace really defends can score more than I thought can play make more than I thought, you know Eddie obviously, this is huge Off. The Bench Isles has done a couple things as shown me a little something.  You know that there's clearly Talent there. The the Papas is working to unlock their quite Lonnie Walker. You know, they have a lot of bodies a lot of guys who play really hard, you know, they play their same way and you know again solid as ever when hover around 50 games like pop always does and you know, they're they're they're going to be right there near the top of the West Denver I notably  You know was not huge on but you know a good start to the season for them. You know, yoga job obviously is the guy I think the question is who's the second guy? You know, I think Jamal Murray is the obvious answer but you know, he needs to make a little leap again, you know, he's been really good, but there is career and make taking little jumps every season, but he needs to make a pretty  Significant significant one this year same with Gary Harris, you know, I think my concerns still with them remains Millsaps kind of falling off a little bit or hitting kind of a little veteran wall. You know, we'll see jury's still out on that hasn't been you know, hugely productive so far, but Jeremy Grant the big addition Off the Bench Torrey Craig is a heck of the defender and you know had a huge.  Block on Booker to to win the game against Phoenix Malik Beasley can shoot you can play defense. My Morris is a solid backup point guard team, you know, they're just there's a lot across the board. You know, I think again, it's to me it's just about every team in the west, you know, even the Spurs have Lamarcus and the rose and you know, pretty much all the teams at the top have have two stars. I think yoga just clearly is star.  Are you know and Jamal Murray clearly has that capability. We just need to see it every night from him not just on occasion stroke Phoenix two and one really good impressive start for them to really like what I've seen Monty Williams has done a great job there so far, you know book obviously is fantastic Kaminsky Off the Bench as been really good and makes it a little little mind-boggling.  Why he didn't play last year in Charlotte, you know, I think Javon Carter is a heck of a Defender really gritty having a real point guard in Rubio obviously helps having a you know, a big in Danes veteran obviously helps losing Aiden for something stupid does not help can't be taking diuretics. He knew what he was putting his body not good. Sorry, which is gritty really gritty guy.  15 and 10 Uber a gave him 20, you know Tyler Johnson has been solid Off. The Bench Bridge has been solid Off the Bench, you know, they've got they've got pieces to be competitive and you know, both of those struggles, especially if Aiden's suspension is upheld, you know, they have to hold down the fort without him, but, you know been really competitive, you know in just about every game to start the season  Them and I think yeah, they can make a huge leap 35 40 wins, you know Monty has them again playing really good ball really impressive. Like I said knocked off the clippers, but still not much reason to be concerned. They're specially while George comes back, you know similar to what I talked about in Miami. They do a great job, you know her L Zu Bots, you know, they do the rolling.  Patrick Patterson jamychal Green Space the floor phenomenally. Well Patrick Beverley obviously is a pitbull Kauai, you know is the best player in the league right now Landry sham. It's a bunch player that but she's me bunch better than a whole bunch of people thought.  You know Lou is Lou obviously he's gotten so much better as a password. You just be able to go left only to shoot now. We can go right to shoot or pass just picks people apart in the pick-and-roll in the two-man game harkless looks real It Off the Bench playing with the tremendous amount of energy, you know, Doc is an amazing coach. So yeah, the they might win 60  65 if George comes back reasonably soon, you know, they're going to be really really good Portland snuck out when in Dallas last night, you know, they yeah, I think they're they're still right there. They're cunning that Denver group to me, you know, love Dame love CJ, obviously, I think the question just is you know again the Clippers, Utah.  You know the Lakers so many teams made this this big leap, you know, did Portland do enough to keep Pace remains to be seen, you know, I think they're relying on the development of a guy young guy like Simmons this season, you know, there was a relying on Zack Collins to really improve and make a jump. You know, I think they you know, they need white side obviously to hold down the fort until nerd gets back.  You know, but we know what them they're going to play hard every night, you know that they clearly have those two stars, you know, the Rodney Hood continues to look good for them. And you know is the most more underpaid players in the league. Yeah, every reason to still be optimistic about their growth, you know, that they've been there since they know what they're doing. They've you know, they've got a wild  Figure things out. But what they don't have you know is the flexibility that some teams will have like like the Clippers, you know, Glide needs some load management, you know, you can afford to be without George for a while Portland needs, you know, they need Damon CJ to play just about every game, you know, which is taxing is a big load on those guys, you know, the Lakers, you know a DI, it's funny. You know, you hear people  Talk to people who watch the Pelicans and you know, they would tell you that ad wasn't all that good in the post. And then you see him with the Lakers. He's just killing guys from the left block, you know shows you fans or the Synergy numbers, you know, just as a lot of bias, you know or people that don't really know what they're watching ad is a heck of a poster vocals going to be committed to pounding and pounding the ball down there through  Ooh him through LeBron down in the post as well. Avery Bradley looks good. Gritty as ever defensively in good shape all offensively giving them a little jolt there. Troy Daniels Dudley obviously can make shots white looks good, you know travail look competent. I think Rondo, you know will help Quinn cook just shies away from the moment a little bit too much for me Cruz has been good. He does not try it.  He's got he's got Swagger. Danny Green is fit in perfectly. So, you know, it's a process to figure out their exact identity. But yeah, they're going to be just fine with with Ron Nady and the pieces around them and obviously, you know getting because back will be huge, you know, and I think you know that third piece kind of determines how far they can go but  you know, they surrounded the roster with with vets Danny like Bradley and you know guys who can really play and I think they'll be you know, one of the best teams in the west All Season Utah's is somehow emerged two and one despite Conley's brutal shooting slump at times, you know, Quin Snyder proven why he's one of the best coaches in the league even without  You know bogdanovich at times Royce O'Neill is an X-Factor for them. He was the guy somebody with Utah told me is just really going to break out there. They're really high on him. You know, I think Donovan doesn't need a score 30 every game anymore. Just great more balanced Jeff Green Off the Bench Moody Off the Bench Ingles Off the Bench, obviously Ed Davis, you know, they deep team really well coached team.  Team, they play together is my point they you know, it's not about any one guy. It's Rudy being a superstar defensively Donovan getting most of the points offensive ly Mike Conley being the veteran bogdanovich giving them, you know big scoring punch when needed just really solid across the board Dallas has had a good start 2 & 1, you know wins over the Pelicans and wizards lost to the Blazers Luca and kp2  They're obviously look really darn good. You know question is just who else is with them? You know, I think they yeah clearly don't have a third banana that might not even have five stop solid starters. I like the line, right? But yeah aside from that, you know, Seth Curry is a bench piece. It's pretty limited pretty slim pickings just have not done a good job filling out that roster, you know, and I think that  That will be why they why they don't make the playoffs. But if I'm wrong if Carlisle, you know can really get the rest of those guys to outperform and be solid compliments to Luke and KP. I might very well be wrong Houston talking about struggling defensively. Well, maybe that's why you shouldn't have fired your entire defensive coaching staff that held one of the best defenses of the past couple of years that nearly knocked off Golden State Which F is delek.  And a really good defensive scheme getting rid of all those guys made no sense. No disrespect else in turn. But yeah, just nonsensical, you know Russ's has been really good Harden's been struggling obviously, but he'll be fine. You know, they they have enough they're clearly to win. They'll be a top four seed ultimately all the narrative with them is going to be about the playoffs. That's just the way it is.  So, you know if Harden has to Pace himself a little bit more and kind of float through most of the regular season as long as they you know, still the top four or five sixteen, you know, and if he's saving more in the tank to go all out in the playoffs and what Russ do a little bit more of this regular season fine, you know, I as we know nobody cares about the MVPs or how many 50-point games Harden has or still going to trash him until he gets over the hump in the playoffs. It's stupid. It's  Out of but it is also the culture and you know, it's about rings and winning and so on and so forth. So yeah talk to me in five or six months, Oklahoma City big win over the Golden State Warriors who everybody is in full-on panic mode about you know, Oklahoma City competitive against the Wizards against Utah. They were no into T home against Golden State, you know, and everybody says,  Is talking about how terrible they are and you know, they're probably not very good. But they have pride everybody in the NBA a lot of Pride they came out, you know punched Golden State in the in the mouth yesterday. Shy looks really good proven me wrong so far. He might be a lot better than I thought having Chris Paul there to Mentor him obviously helps, you know, people forget so is much about your situation and your surroundings as it is about as about your abilities.  you know Gallinari is still terrific first has been good, you know Adams, I think hopefully they can maybe trade a couple of these pieces, you know, because it's still going to be a long 25 30 something Men season, you know, Chris Paul still way up there in age, but still is heavy as ever and as good of a vet presence as you can have so yeah, we definitely expect  Them to compete as long as they have him and the do things the right way and Billy Dee's solid coach Taylor Jenkins solid coaches. Well, I had a good start huge win against Brooklyn last night ja terrific obviously, you know, like the way they play fun to watch, you know fun.  Sorry blank. And for a second look. Yeah, just a competitive roster across the board everybody. That's out there plays hard. Jae Crowder plays tenaciously hard Clark's look good. You know Bruno's a good piece Jen's veteran Brooks can really score Jackson, you know obviously is going to be a really really good player in this league. I wonder if maybe they can talk iguodala's back into into showing up and you know being a part of  Team, that's fun and competitive because I think he can make them, you know whole lot better and you know, probably still not going to the playoffs or anything like that. But you know, they can win 30 35 games. You know Jaws is like I said, I think he's maybe the best pure passing point guard from day one. He's got phenomenal feel for the game. He's proven he can score better than I thought even he's a, you know, had a huge defensive play against Kyrie.  She sent over time so going to be special. They're going to be fine, you know growing year obviously, but a fun really fun team to watch not fun to watch so far Golden State reminder though their own to relax too long season. Okay starting to guys in Chris and Glenn Robinson who nearly were out of the league, you know, Chris could have easily floated overseas Robinson didn't have a lot of  This offseason both those guys are starting their beds made up of no names and rookies and you know, God knows who yes, they still have stars and Stephen D'Angelo and Draymond and they should be playing better than this. But anytime you have to you know, integrate like six guys in your rotation from absolute scratch. There's going to be growing pains. I still think they're going to make the playoffs. I still think give it at least 10 15  18 games before we're in full on freakout mode losing to Oklahoma City who are owing to at home not unforgivable. They were more competitive against the Clippers in the first game. There's plenty of time all the people freaking out about Steve Kerr don't know what they're talking about. There's a reason why he doesn't run Steph Curry and 60 pick and rolls every game reason is his body type is ability to see things more than just the first pass when I  That is yes Steph Synergy analytics, whatever they ran a lot of pick-and-roll and his MVP season. He'll still run plenty of pick-and-roll. But his thing is he's small. So when you rotate over if the Trap stuff in the pic of hole and then you rotate over and take away that first pass a to Dream On he has a hard time seeing over seven Footers and making those skip jump skip passes against a trap to the corner and even if he does make that pass, it's Glenn Robinson over there.  It's not a guy with a whole lot of confidence. They know they're leaving. There's a reason why he's not Steve Kerr's not an idiot. Okay, there's no magical ski most importantly in the NBA. It's not about X's and O's it's about Jules and Jose. They don't have the Personnel right now any system, whatever system you want to play first of all starts with playing hard playing harder playing together learning each other. They have more than most beautiful offensive systems and of all time with Draymond passing the ball with stuff.  Flying off screens doing everything obviously harder when you lose not only your superstar in KD, but the other Superstar you were still do have on your team and Klay Thompson. They're severely undermanned right now. Hang in there level the survive the storm, you know, give it a little bit of time. I think they'll be okay, but you know that they were killing Steve Kerr even when they win championships and win 60 games. So the noise levels at an all-time.  I'm high. I just have to tune it out find a way to grind out a few wins speaking of grinding out some wins desperate for winds at this point New Orleans Sacramento narrative about Pelicans much better. Obviously without Zion, you know that they've still been really competitive lonzo's been pretty good. Ingram's been really good Alexander Walker, you know, the heart's been solid Off the Bench  You know, I think they yeah, they're right there that you have every reason to be encouraged about that team. But you know, you look science going to be out a couple months. So, you know, there's got to be a sense of urgency. You have to just find a way to win some games. Whatever your recipe is for doing that if it's in Ingram scoring 30, 35 points, you know, then do that if it's you know Lonzo spread the getting everybody involved if it's true being more aggressive.  You know if it's given JJ go to a little bit more Alvin Gentry just has to find a way to get them some some early wins before, you know, Season really slips away from them because I do still think you know that they can they can hover around 500 hover around competition for the eighth seed. But yeah movement losing Zion obviously was was a big blow to that and makes things a whole lot harder Sacramento. Yeah. I crushed them on Twitter the other day.  Because firing Dave Yeager just made no sense, you know to take that team 39 whatever they won last season when most people thought they would win 20 before the season was incredibly impressive Luke Walton like KD tweeted at me. Yes still a young coach in the league still has time to figure out maybe he figures it out in Sacramento, but you know to me he's not he's not but he's not suppose not Brad Stevens, you know, he  Not a coach that's worth firing your coach for I think Sacramento still did they signed some vets and Ariza? Dedmon, Cory Joseph but you know the Stars everybody on the team is Young, you know Fox Bagley, you know bogdanovich complaining about his role. Apparently, you know, there's a lot of guys who aren't fully bought into winning and doing what it takes Yeager. I thought was a disciplinarian held guys accountable was was tough on  Them, you know and Luke so far has not you know did not do that in La you know as not done a good job in his first three games in Sacramento obviously early plenty of time to figure it out. But yeah, you know, not not an encouraging start at all, especially to not even be competitive, you know, just getting absolutely smacked by Phoenix by Utah, you know looking  Man up. They've got Denver. They've got the Hornets Utah the Knicks the Raptors the Hawks Blazers plenty of chances to get some wins in there. But you know clock's ticking. I think the leap for them. I predicted them to be in the 9 seat again. Like they were last year anything worse than that is a failure. You know, I think they're good enough to be in the playoffs. That should be the goal goal should be making the playoffs if they're worse than I thought if there.  R regressed from last year that is not good for Vlad a for veck and the front office that continues to fire good coaches for no reason. So anyway, thank you guys very much for listening. I apologized early in the morning going through the whole league. I'm sure there's guys I missed things. I screwed up on tweet at me. Let me know where I was dumb, but appreciate you guys listening.

spotify:episode:1Et77iXMZHKCm50ZMO5JOo	 All right, gang check check one two check check check one two. All right gang. We are live. We are back here on the soapbox. This is episode. I think 11 or 12, which is pretty awesome. And I'm actually in a hotel traveling around for a CrossFit level 2 seminar. It was a super busy week, so I didn't get to record in Normal Abode, but I wanted to bring my stuff along with me and chat about some stuff. So.  Last podcast we had I was with Paul Tremblay. We had a lot of good feedback on just barrier to entry that type of stuff. So really appreciate that on Buried entry to and across it affiliate this week. I'd like to switch gears a little bit and talk nutrition nutrition is it's a topic that most people don't like to talk about because it's kind of like religion and politics it brings up so much emotion, and it's really what I want to kind of talk about.  That helped me a little back story on me and my life when it comes to nutrition. When I found CrossFit. I found CrossFit Journal issue 21, and with that I read the article which explains the zone and and then from there. I followed the zone to a tee. I weighed and measured food that I was just naturally eating sandwiches. So on and so forth that changed my life. It was unbelievable.  my relationship with food changed so much after that and  I quickly learned about quality of food because I could eat more of it. So when I was owning, you know, just normal food that I was eating. I learned that okay, well favorable unfavorable carbohydrates and as it was written in the in the in the cross of journalists, you're 21 at the time. It was super simple. It's like, all right. Well, are you have bread right a half a slice of bread is a block of carbohydrates. So if I have a sandwich that's four blocks carbohydrate. So why not just get rid of the bread and eat more fruits and vegetables and other things because I want to  More food and that was my natural progression essentially into you know, you know, you could consider it paleo. I would almost consider it more like a you know, whole Natural Foods like we talked about the level on meats and vegetables nuts and seeds some fruit little starch and sugar and the reason why it's not you know, I don't know if I actually ever truly prescribed to the paleo diet the paleo diet, you know omission of grains Dairy and legumes and very very restrictive depending on the practitioner that you're  thirstier you're learning from but the reality is whole natural foods naturally occurring absolutely having less processed and refined carbohydrates check and that really did change my life and I weighed and measured my food for about five years straight and never cheating. And for those of you that were around me at that time know that and I changed my life and I recommend everyone to do the Zone because of my experience and I know that seems like what does that mean? Well,  I learned about food I learned about a relationship with food. I understood macro nutrients better protein carbohydrates and fats. I learned how to turn my body into a laboratory. It was super easy because it was a block system and it wasn't super complex. It wasn't super minut in the details and into what some of the stuff we're seeing nowadays now. I'm not saying the zone is the diet that works for everybody. I'm just saying it taught me something and I now use it and I use that.  Base knowledge for everything that I do from a nutritional perspective. Can you go through that learning process without it? Of course, but coming from someone like myself who really had no scope or understanding but a goal it really helped me. So I definitely recommend it if you want to start to learn and go down that Journey but you know, is it hard? Yeah. Well crossfit's hard and we still do it because we know that hard work gets results. So yeah, you got to do a little more than nothing, but I don't think that's an excuse and you know if we're looking for that.  Type of hey, like I just need I don't want to work hard, but I want to see results. You know, I understand nutrition is different than Fitness, but at some level it's like all right. Well, if you want to do 20% of what would be 100% effective you're going to get 20% of the results, which means you won't get as much results and you won't get there as faster, which is okay as long as you're aware of that but just be aware of that right? Well variance functionality and intensity isn't variance functionality and low in density is high intensity.  And that intensity gets results. So if you go at low or moderate intensity, you'll get lower moderate results. No different with nutrition. So with that said what what I don't want to talk about is preached about a type of diet I want I want to talk about is I think a problem and infestation that we have in the nutritional world nowadays and I think it's a narrative. That is It's upsetting because I don't think anyone wants to do it. I just think it's how people  We'll think it should be done. I don't think at the heart people are have mal-intent everything people have care and I've talked about this a lot. So what I mean by that is alright when someone is talking about a nutritional regiment or type of way to eat or whatever. It might be.  what has been creeping into a lot of presentations creeping into a lot of narrative out there is eat this way because the other ways are stupid eat in my way because the other way will kill the environment will you know, kill you whatever it might be so my way or whatever way I'm talking about  I'm not going to talk about the health benefits of then how about the negative effects of the other ways so essentially vilifying other types of Foods nutritional programs diets. What have you over highlighting the benefits of whatever style of nutrition we're talking about and I really think this is a problem because I don't think we should be doing that type of stuff. So for example, right take the the vegetarian or vegan.  World because it's a world that I think is very interesting. I'm not a vegetarian or vegan. I have a lot of friends that are I know a lot of people that are I know a lot of people that were registering for 20-30 years and have changed and I've spoken to some of the most educated people in the world, which is not me on this topic and it's interesting because putting everything aside I do notice that a lot of the you know, why do I eat this way? Well, and unfortunately I've been  I've heard this I've seen it's like well, I don't eat meat or I'm a vegan because of what meat does to you or what these other thing? It's a very negative based as opposed to what I would really love to hear from specifically that Community but others is what are the benefits of a plant-based diet. That's what I want to hear. I don't want to hear the negatives of other diets. I want to hear the  Fitz of that diet which I know there are benefits and their office also shortcomings and yeah, let's not also as every there's no perfect fit right the fact that we think that one size fits on everyone should do something is ridiculous. So like there's always pros and cons but it's got to work for you. Right? So what is the narrative that I want changing guys? This can be a simple Concept in a simple episode is Art. What are the benefits of eating a plant-based diet?  Diet, you know the micro nutrient content the fiber the you know, the real foods, whatever it might be like, you know what it can do for gut health, whatever. I want to hear. I want to see it. That's what I want to know. So if like hey guys, I want to bring awareness about this type of nutrition program because I'm passionate about it. I like it. It's something that I enjoy great. Tell me what's good about it. What I would rather not hear is what's negative. And so then I did some self-reflection talking to people. It's like, all right. Well, how how  I- about other things and I think that okay, you know.  All right special interest groups, right? Well any special interest group has a special interest in whatever they have a special interest in and therefore relatively biased if you think that you're right, you're right, right. So the good thing is is I was like I well I think I vilified sugar for sure. I vilified processed sugar. It's not good for you. We should stay away from it. But what's funny and I so I was like, you're right. I have done that. I that's the one thing I have.  so I guess my thought process is does that unify across almost all rational nutrition programs and what I mean by that is site from veganism to vegetarianism to you know, the raw meat diet, which I guess would be the other end of the Spectrum, which I know nothing about but and I'm not sure many people do to the Paleolithic diet to zoning to intermittent fasting to the ketogenic diet, you know to you know, you know anabolic fasting to  Purification unit but let's go. We got this forever. I'd pretty much across the board. That is one thing. Everyone agrees on sugar is something we should stay away from it's not that we want you to never have cake or enjoy things. We just realized it's a treat it is something that is that yeah. It tastes really good. And if we end it's something that we know we shouldn't be it's not really necessary for survival. We know that it adds really no nutrient value. Other than that empty calories that it provides but it tastes  Great, and it's there's there's there's nothing wrong with that other than the fact that unfortunately, it's Laden with in a lot of processed foods and it's masked and within a lot of processed foods and foods that are you know, not naturally occurring so that's something we need to be mindful of so I think that and again let's just pause there for a second to like food that's naturally occurring so like all right. Well, you have plants and vegetables and fruits and nuts and seeds and meats and all these things and all of the nutrition.  Programs out there. I really do think so. All right. What do we agree on whole process unprocessed food Whole Foods. So yeah, are you don't want to eat me? All right. Well what we know the challenging to be Associated there you don't eat vegetables. We know this the the challenges Associated there, you know, but when it's all said and done, we're all really trying to fight the same fight. We want to put healthy fuel into our body now if you have a religious or if you have a moral value when it comes to something  There's nothing wrong with that just you know, there's a little different purpose behind that and it's not as much nutritional. I can't speak to that too much because that's not something I'm I understand quite frankly to well. It's not something I'm involved with but there's nothing wrong with that because it's works for it allows it to work for you and your lifestyle right? But it's just another variable to way when your when your nutritional regiments I do caution.  And here's my caution on any of this stuff because I've tried a lot of stuff guys have I really enjoy intermittent fasting now, you know, I've got, you know, I have never really truly done the ketogenic diet, but I understand it and I said I've eaten very clean for a long time. I've waited measure my food and different shapes or forms, but we need to be mindful of data that we see in studies that we see, you know it, you know the effects of you know,  Cultivating on Farmland on things like that like the effects on the environment the effects on this or that like because it's and I tell you I don't know. I don't know here at here's the I don't know the answer because it's so overwhelming amount of information out there the amount of that I can read something like wow, this is amazing. I can watch a documentary on Netflix or whatever and be like, wow, this is 100% the way need to live my life. I need to change everything. You know, they said that there's a new movie out James Cameron directed that I haven't even seen yet. But you know, I mean, I'm sure it's  Decorating no different than you know all the other movies and you know out there that you can heal sugar-coated and all these other things like wow, like you kind of go into this existential debate and I think that we just need to really look at where the studies are coming from. And what is a what is the study read it because when you read studies you're like and you have to nerd out on if you really going to go to the bank on this stuff. I don't know what you guys are reading. It's up to you guys, but really question everything.  Ethan you're reading because it's correlation is not causation.  Okay correlation is not causation which means we can't say if this then that if it's a coral it and and being able to derive causation is something that is very difficult to do we can take best practices and learn and understand that stuff. But I just wanted to get this off my chest keep this episode relatively short, but guys, let's stop.  Bringing down other types of nutrition just leave with the Positive. Hey guys, I want you to learn about this this style of eating. I like it. I ate this way and this is the benefits that I see cool awesome, and I'm not talking bad about any other nutritional regiment. I'm just talking about this or it's it doesn't have to be negative about other things and I just it can be a simple conversation that way that you know, or are we all trying to be healthier people?  Yeah, cool, then let's stop fighting about it. Now. The proof is also in the pudding. Let's let's get real. Right like I'm around a lot of people that are relatively fit and I see a lot of common denominators and it when I be fit when and here's the thing.  efficacy matters  I have the opportunity to be around some of the fittest people in the world and we're not talking the CrossFit Games athletes because I'm friends with those guys, but I'm talking, you know, just people that have been doing CrossFit for a decade and I know what they can physically do. I also know their health markers. I also know how they've handled, you know surgeries and injuries and setbacks and honestly across the board they all eat relatively the same.  They really do they've tried different things and they're stored if they sat in front of Mike probably similar similar and wherever they're at. Most all of them eat meats and vegetables nuts and seeds some fruit little starch. No sugar. They've waited measure their food in some way shape or form their way of how much food they put into the body. They're clear that they want that clean Whole Foods, but they eat a spectrum of proteins. They eat nice different spectrum of vegetables and eat good healthy fats and they eat the right amounts and honestly,  Those are the people that are the healthiest. I don't know their blood work is wonderful, and they get it tested because they're maniacs.  It works and and the people that I respect the most that are within the nutritional field also have challenged and continually learn. I was go back to even Clara's and Kowski. I've you know, and I've had her on my on my YouTube Vlog and like it just you know, they anagram challenge is the most all-inclusive nutrition thing you could ever have because it's hey guys eat a hundred grams of fruits and vegetables a day and then from there fill in the gaps. It's the rest up to you and it's really cool because that's a really simple low-hanging fruit, but  You know, it's very inclusive to every single human in the world yet because there's a lot of benefits to eating that type of stuff and she talks about those benefits and it's pretty cool stuff. So notice how it's not not no Mission diet. It's an inclusive diet and and again in a world where I think people are too sensitive. They're two emotional they take things too seriously or and they jump to conclusions too much about what works be mindful of this stuff. But like this notion of be inclusive be inclusive I get it.  It but let's actually be clear of is your want for inclusivity actually being exclusive which is inappropriate. We want to make people healthier. We want to make people better. How do we do that B+ highlight things let's not vilify. Let's not put in a corner. Let's keep it super simple and just because you do something does not mean it's okay for other people, but you can talk about your experiences what you liked what you didn't like and if you are convicted for  For some reason to something 100% solely and not willing to look at something else then usually your Viewpoint is flawed.  Just be aware of that. Hey, I'm 100% invested in this because of this reason and that's okay. That's fine. Just be careful of pushing that on others if that's your reasoning. There's nothing wrong with that but we might not want to let that sort of overlay and others there. So again some nutrition stuff. Hopefully this stuff help you guys but let's let's just help our people out right caloric restriction Works eat less eat the right amount of foods, and and you're going to live long and happy gosh. I love it.  Fasting I've been doing it and you know, it's like and I've loosened up the reins. I haven't been so maniacal about it. But yeah, like most of the time I'm fasting for 16 hours eating for eight my energies phenomenal works for me doesn't work for everyone. But like I finally found that Vibe and and I'm really enjoying it. So weekends are a little different than during the week. But you know, I really enjoy it and you know, that's where I'm at right now my nutritional Journey. Hopefully you guys can share some of your thoughts concerns comments, you know, hit me up. I law have this posted up on YouTube as well. Thank you guys.  And we'll see you in the next episode.  	"In this episode I talk about a problem I have seen creeping into the world of Nutrition space and it is how we talk about other types of diets.  There are MANY ways to eat an ways to get to results and many are based on your goals as well.  In this episode I talk about HOW we have gone wrong with going in the other direction and vilifying other types of diets that are not ""YOURS"" and how this is dangerous and overall counterproductive to helping others.  Take a listen and chill the heck out!  "

Yeah, I was the youngest so yeah because I didn't I met obviously your older brother first and he came to Watford. I don't know at what point but he came for a year, right?  Yeah, okay, and then those aren't even 12 or 11. I think yeah, we saw him at a battle in Trocadero and he just came up to most I think I was like hey, bro, you live in Watford. And then yeah next thing. I know they brought him to training and then he became friends and then it was actually only after he left that mean you became friends with it. You like stayed and hang out with us and train but I think you also quite Young when Isaac was here. We're definitely must have been like what 14 something. Yeah. Yeah he 15. So yeah, we move to Watford. Yeah.  2009 be living in what forever since I've done my studies and whatnot here in England is all and then yeah during that time Isaac a met you guys I wasn't really I was dancing back in Germany still. Yeah, but it wasn't like taking to it yet. Like I love dancing. I was going it was that what I wanted to do was all kind of thing but not until like I hit like 15, that's what I really took on the Journey of wanted to get better trying to Excel and you know that type of thing.  That's that's when I started getting closer to you guys as well because I knew you and what food is around the corner. Yeah, and we were also super dope. That's what you mean. Yeah. He's like, yeah. The reason I can I hang out with you guys because it's again it's convenient. I really would have loved to train with someone else but you know you guys around yeah, I didn't have to take the underground together know obviously I'm playing. Yeah, so then okay, so then obviously a stayed in Watford we've done loads of stuff together and whatever and you've done your own stuff here, but when  You how long have you been back in Berlin now for good?  I moved back to Berlin last year. Okay. Yeah, like kind of this time last year or it's January 2020. But yeah, I'd say about not say about  like march-may times maybe a thing. Okay. Yeah, so maybe like just under a year you mean? Yeah, maybe just on the okay, but I've been back and forth as well more times just back and forth but mainly staying in Germany. Yes. I it's like yeah you always a bit people see me as your family still here. Yeah, come here come here and see them and then you're back in Germany in your own place. Yeah, so then all right. So, how did it go from?  Okay, I'm 15 and I want to start dancing and now you are like in a movie. Where did that come from? Well sabzi come from the back the battle scene. Yeah, just in the battle scene. I feel that teachers feel like teaches you a lot teaches you a lot of discipline any way to like kind of bail yourself and that also kind of transfers onto life is also when it was from training every day. I realize okay. I need to do my studies as well if I want to have like a bigger plan or have that.  A backup or not? Yeah, so I feel like it was a lot of trading a lot of training connections meeting people, you know, they kind of happened organically happen. Organically, I'd say it wasn't like, oh, I got an agent and the agent like booked me for this movie or something like that. You know, it's not just like they found you from yeah. Like I have a friend out in Germany called Pepita. She's a choreographer. Okay. Yeah, and she we've done a job before that. I think the month before two months before that and yeah, we connected really well.  I liked her so she liked my stuff and then she was she's the choreographer of the movie. So she suggested me to the director the director real Acme went for the audition. And when she suggested you it was for the role that you eventually got or none of what I went to this evil was the main role. I didn't get the main role. Okay, because I was like to like the main rule is meant to be like 1560 in the movie and I'm actually yeah, how tall are you by the way?  The people that you're sitting down, okay. Yeah, you've been hitting the gym obviously not much everybody. Yeah. Yeah, but I know that you can't play 15 anymore. Yeah. So yeah, and then they gave me a number of their said I would perfectly fit into that's like yeah pretty cool row. I felt I didn't it didn't feel alien to me. You know, what was wrong? Basically we I'ma Do we could Joe and pepper pepper. We're powdered Street and seen we  Really know the street that scene and the main role is also in the street then seen these kind of power over click, but then again, he's not he's got he's in his own world, but he's just always around that type of thing. I don't know if that makes sense. My life's a way street dance click. Yeah, Joan pepper like the leaders of the street and click and we have Marlin and he's just always in the room for example, but he's not really with us all the time. But uh if they're kind of you know, so that's that's kind of the role that I play and  And you've never done any acting before this no and they knew that. Yeah, and like when you went to do the audition shit, did you have to act like or was it more like dance and then we'll do the rest of it was like no doing acting scene and you are we started with the acting scene. Okay, which I feel like I messed up a lot on but I don't know what this like that must have seen something that worked for them. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it was funny. It was funny because I kept messing up the text. Oh, really? Yeah, like as in forgetting the lines or what?  Kept mixing up. I think what was obviously for context. This is in German. Yeah. This isn't the movies in Germany, which is your first language. Yeah. Yeah exactly. I'm just making it worse. So for context it wasn't in your second language so you got no excuse at this because obviously I studied here and all these type of things. I feel like I can even articulate myself better in English. Now, they really then in German - it did that affect you do in the Scripture. It was even that I just I feel like when I act like  eggs  I still need to of course that comes with experience but I still need to learn how to like control my emotions and still remember the script. Yeah, and you know because I can't get into Mercury the words mixed up in stuff, but they weren't too fixed on me getting all the words perfect, but they wanted to see more of the emotions and how I appear on screen and things like that. Well, I guess with and I know fucking nothing but I guess with film it's like they can always do the take again. It's not like a play right? We have to be able to get all your lines right the whole way through.  Whereas film is like okay fucked up the line but like if he gets it, right? Yeah be a banger kind of thing. So I read yeah fair enough and ended up working really well. So yeah, okay sake and how long were you filming that? It wasn't long, you know, it was like a month that we were filming. Okay, and it's like a street dance base through the kind of pre pre ordinary story is like nothing spectacular biologists hasn't been in Germany before. Yeah, so it's like I'm all german-based or filmed in Germany. Yeah, and it's like set in Germany.  Well, yeah. Yeah, okay. Okay sick. So I was going to ask anything else whether I'm not sure so yeah that's coming out with Dave coming out. I think just before somebody said okay. Yeah, they haven't given us any updates yet. But I feel like is from what I remember what they said. They said yeah. Okay cool. And then obviously you kind of open to like if more stuff comes from that. Yeah, definitely that guy had a crack in time. Yeah.  The film is good is good. Definitely a good experience once because I feel like I've danced is what kind of used to also be in front of cameras and whatnot. If you've done music videos and whatnot and also with like the some of the modeling that I did I already did feel comfortable comfortable in front of the camera. Yeah, so that wasn't so alien to yeah, and I guess being in a street dance movie. It's not like they're asking you to like method act be in the Joker or you know what? I mean? It's like okay this  Is kind of like my life. I just have to like really say a few pre-written lines kind of thing. So now I can imagine that's not  As like scary is doing something else could be would you do other shit? Like if they were like do you like a completely fingers? I can imagine that it will be hard but obviously has not going to stop me from trying to for New Opportunities have a thing I can imagine it hard if I had to do like some play Cycles or is that something you think you'd enjoy? Yeah. I feel like yeah would cause a challenge is a challenge and it's not impossible. What? No, it's just I just need to do it. Yeah, so it's definitely something you and I would be open.  I mean it would be great for the podcast. If you went on to be a famous movie star and then people came in this this went viral have a great so if you could for me, thanks. I'll try my best. Appreciate your help friend. Yeah. Okay cool. And then so you moved back to Berlin that's like some point in the last year and a half were saying and your brothers are out there. Yeah, so you got a younger brother Lennox. Yeah. My younger one is here. Oh, he's sorry. He's here. Yeah, and then you got two older brothers in  Yeah in Berlin Co and as I can print Isaac and Prince also dances. Yeah and like together you like a my K is your group is not only family people in EM. Okay, right. Not only family who else is in am okay. So and how did they get there if it's not because it started off as a family thing, right? Yeah kind of so, well, if I do go back yeah, tell her tell me the story. So yeah and my case I came once is in krump. Yeah, and we were a bunch of people.  Poojas dancing in the youth center that Prince was working at okay. Yeah crumping crumping afterward transition to go into hip-hop. And yeah, so obviously live have been some people jump off the other things school, and then we were like fill a finger like six people of and then two more jumped off. It was like already a crew or is more still just like a group of friends kind of thing. We already accrued. Yeah. Yeah. Bye.  That time we were ready a crew Yeah by a bunch of people jumped off and then in like two years ago. I say of to three years ago. We were four people me Prince Isaac and Richie. Yeah, and then when she's not related you just read she's not related to us, but we've known him like since Primetime. Yeah, but very long time that type of thing and then I think last year two years ago. We got two new people give any Mi ke and  James of my K and the first person that we created last year in the middle of last year nails and make a yes. Oh, yes. I know. Yeah, I know of gifty do various people but I haven't met her and then Jaden ever met. So now with seven people. Yeah. Okay. So how did you go from like the for especially like it being like a close-knit family people that were all trained together what made you like? Bring the others in was it more like business or like we trying to like get things in the crew that you didn't have or was it more?  They were just around and like the more they kind of became family but man the crew right like what I'm asking is how can I get some camera? It's like a mixture of things I say because at that point I was evil for people Isaac was out there laying that time like three of us in his best line living in fear. We're in Bevis.  It's ago, you know, like yeah free people feel free out for studying and stuff. So we were all like a crew family. We know we're family but can also do not own thing trying to hold it together, which work well good, but which also worked well, but we felt like okay we want to get bigger. We want to go into different things as well. So we kind of need to also be open to letting other people in  Could we have so many people around us that grew up around us and stuff like that. But we also it was always like oh this Mi ke and we have like different just people around us that know are part of the kind of Mi ke thing. Yeah, Mike a movement, but there weren't we never labeled them a my K now if that kind of makes it? Yeah, even though like functionally they were part of the family, but you weren't giving them the official. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. So after a while I was like, okay, we want to you want to get to another level when you do new things so we need  Kind of also new people and it wasn't even new people because most of them were around us. Yeah, right. They were right wasn't such a hard thing of like, oh, let's look for new people. Yeah so did so that's why I say it was like a mixture. So the first one that we took on the first two people were James and gifty and gift the gift. The all says history of us like with Prince. Mostly. Okay Prince is dead Mak increase the oldest brother. Yeah oldest brother and he's the one that made them ik yeah, they already had a history and a German.  So thank you make it sound like that. Good luck some mad stunt. Mr. Mike had some history and I was like a romance and then Warren. Yeah, it's like they from the battle scene like a from what gift he said is she always looked up to Prince. Okay, because Prince when he was battling as one of like the first generation badly hippo battle is in Germany. He was a gift you would look up to people like Prince. Yeah. So I remember seeing Prince there was a battle. I think express your style expertise is  and it was him with M&P dog. Yeah. Yeah finals against I want you to know was it what was it? I'm gonna look it up right now because we didn't benefit breath. It must be from it was either them or like yeah, cool Fabrice and Cannon or something. I think you're right. It was a lot of like one point was like one of the bigger like things in Europe. I'm just going to check and make sure  I think it was that pretty soon. Let's say let's say I think you're right.  Coat. This is just I typed in Prince and p-dog and this is lots of dogs cool. They express the you're at some point. We're going to get to the point where this can be put up on the screen on the video, but but we're not there yet. We're still growing guys. Give me a chance.  They are yeah this one p BB are you? All right. He was right guys. Everybody was right. So this was 2011 hip hop find a way to express your style and I remember watching this because I was looking for battles to go to in 2010 or something and that's when I found express yourself. So then I remember seeing that but I never knew that was your brother until way later. But yeah, so anyway all that to say I remember seeing  That way back battling and stuff. So that's cause you know gifty looked up to him from those. Yeah, and even when she used to come over to Berlin like Prince would always take care of things like that and ice and then so he was she from she's from Hamburg. Okay handbook. So that's like three hours from Berlin. Right? And then yeah after a while like copy is Leo see each other events what know and then eventually she would do quite a lot of jobs with us. Okay. Yeah and people saw that her energy matched with us afterwards.  I was like, okay, we're at that point where we said. Okay, we need like less. There's utilize everything that we have around us. Like let's make this grow. Let's go again to bigger things and yeah showing like if you bought that was bringing in people that were bring it in nice energy and stuff right like 50 nails with Jay. Yeah. Yeah because no this was like you guys were battling together for a while first, right? It wasn't like he was in a mic a and then you decided to be partners or was it? Oh no, we've nailed this we were with notices the journey began.  Laughs feet so yeah like you wanted to learn some life you want know we used to live together and then it just came to that we've done events together like bells and whatnot. And you guys did some good shit this year, right? You know, you would yeah flavor armor. Yeah. We're I feel like you had a few like impactful battles for you guys. Definitely are like that one you and I was against the Cozy and Tom. Oh, yeah, it's good as I really love what you're not like even like it doesn't even matter anyway, but  That was nice Vibes, right? So yeah, I liked that. It was a good moment where you guys were killing that day you lost in the finals. Uh, yeah against wasn't some Reds four million some Year from Italy that was dope. So yeah, we were battling we're bending and then after a while it's just like he Vibe so well with the whole fam he's in the house that we all trained and could trans Ally 5. What's like a training space? Yeah training spot where we all that he comes through that space. So it just made sense again. He's around everyone anyway, exactly.  James same thing really he's been around for years as well training in the house. He kind of grew up in that house as well. We were battling for for quite a bit as well as like Partners type of thing and then he jumped into the crew to so yeah, sick Yeah, man. So the idea is kind of just pushing it like a and making it bigger and stuff. And yeah and also like cuz we don't really just want to be seen as like just a dance crew type of thing. That's why we also like like they organize events.  It's like we got Dance Festival that we organize the CDC Festival.  Then we have parties that we also organize. Yeah and like concerts that we also organized as well as dance classes and show as well as dance classes and shows so we're trying to go different directions. What's the reason behind that like IU is it my thing of like, okay, we're going to serve this thing where we can all live off this and it's more like business Empire that your building right or is it more like this stuff that you're interested in, you know, like then you guys particularly want to do or what's the  Kind of Drive behind expanding. Yes. So so I think we all heard it. Like when people when when when people ask you what you do, you say your dancers are also so how do you live of dancing type of things and everyone says we don't yeah exactly. Yeah, if like and we know that many ways. Yeah to live off Dancing if you really put your head to and you really have the right mindset for sure. So for us it's like, okay, we've been doing this for quite a long time now about 15 years now.  It's like we're trying to we're all getting older. So where this is what we love we're trying to live over it as well. And we're like, yeah, there's a point where it comes with like go in and train in and doing bottles and it's not for free is like, yeah, you're kind of like, all right, Mom, and I don't know I need money. I need to be able to write also part of it. And then and then we 4K we need to build something. We need to be our own brand. We need to be our own type of also business for the the outside people of potential.  Other organizations that want to work together that they don't you see as a dance crew, but see as a potential customer potential client people that they want to work with, you know on same I hire not just be like, oh, it's us I don't know what's gonna take advice and advances. Yeah, you know, so it's like actually be like self-sufficient and like being able to yeah, like you said come at eye level from them. Right? Right, right. That's smart. And how what's the dancing like in Berlin? I do you find that.  That it's a bit easier to do that than it would be safer here in Paris where there's like big dance scenes or do you feel like it's still a lot of competition. I feel like Berlin is growing like Berlin has a lot of commercial opportunities for dances for sure underground wise is still growing because we don't have as much as it wants as for example dances in west of Germany that are right next to save France and Holland deck like the lab one hour away from Holland on the train wherever I can.  Training with the Seal of the okay, you know Berlin's like quite big in itself and would imagine you would imagine that there's a lot of dancers just there, you know, but yeah, the underground scene is still growing definitely is right. Now a good place in a good place. I feel like about commercial wise and Governor wise. I feel like when it comes to funding for us and stuff like that. We're still a bit behind to you like say I feel like UK and France and stuff. Is that for hip-hop or do you find?  Maybe the same way like contemporary and ballet and Singapore, right? Yeah for hip-hop. I mean, I guess it's the same with a lot of the world that like the hip-hop the stool as hip-hop becoming like an institution like ballet and contemporary and stuff is taking a bit longer. Obviously. It's Noah by quite a few hundred years, I guess right. So yeah, I guess that's natural. But yeah, so like that's kind of on the come up in Berlin and like being able to get actual legit opportunities through right hip hop and suffer exactly. So for like I said funding things that I feel that with  Ooh a little bit behind and that's why a lot of people that come off the come from the like hip-hop background or what not a lot of them maybe not see the opportunities because they're discouraged by the fact that okay. There's not many people around us that have made it through dancing or things like that and just make you want to try. Yeah, and that's why I feel like people  like also flying steps and stuff like that that really went flying steps of doing a lot right commercial. It had that tour. I do fly news. They've done a few things. So you need people like that to show. Okay, you can live of this you can really do it. Even though Jeremy still a little bit a little bit behind. It's flying steps Berlin. Yeah flights have symbolic meanings. And do you feel like they kind of like you kind of follow a bit in their footsteps of that and they kind of give you a little bit of like an inspiration or you guys on the similar generation or how does that yeah. Well, it's nine steps came before.  Mikey don't actually I things like 'nygh, nygh six or so. I remember flying says when I first started they were like, yeah, definitely they were there before us but they be with courage and ladyboy cream the end and now they're definitely like an inspiration. Yeah, if you look at that way till I'm kind of doing something Beyond just battle are exactly because I'm they got school as well. It's cool. Right, right. Is that kind of the route you want to go? Yeah. Yeah. So when like say a another company comes to Flying steps, they wouldn't just be like, oh, it's just these dancers because  I know they do a bunch of different things. Yeah, they have their own like brand, you know, it's not something. Yeah, we can just like degrade their value type of thing. Yeah, you know, so that's definitely an inspiration when you look at and they're very successful with that when but I feel like we still have kind of like our own name. Yeah. Yeah for sure. Yeah, but it's like that kind of inspiration of like are these are other dances that haven't just stuck to their line. Yeah dancing and like they can go out and do bigger things and more like it's a yeah, of course.  Movies like that, dude. Yeah. Yeah sure thing. So that's definitely sick. Good to see. All right sick. So let's talk about your social media, sir, because like I guess talking about the rise of like a Mike a and  You guys trying to push stuff is like also, I guess it's been last couple years at your social media feel like it's blown up a bit. Mmm. Would you say the last couple of years? Yeah how talk to me about that because you're like what like 16 and a half thousand followers. Right? Right, which is like in social media numbers you like. Oh, yeah 16.5 is if you think about sixteen point five thousand people. Hmm. That's a lot of people those people. Yeah, that would be  But it's like yeah, sometimes I think about this year on social media and it's like I know not everybody's like not all of those 16.5 are watching everything. But yeah, that's a lot of fucking people watching. You know in style. Yeah. How did that like did you do that on purpose? Did it just happen? Like did you think I'm gonna grow my social media this year or did it just blow up out? I feel like  We saw that there's opportunities in social media, especially like for dances. Yeah, like the time that we live in now it's like it's quite blade and I think a lot of people know this and we thought okay, we're going to use all the opportunities that they're there are so or social media was one of them. Yeah. It wasn't the sole purpose to just be like our let's get like all the followers in the world war. Yeah, but I like it was for a reason of like let's use this to ya let's use this as a tool to you.  Create more opportunity and we did this by saying okay, we like bringing out content being creative and things like that and we just did that like by doing videos, you know, trying to yeah. Yeah trying to do that and it works because and how much like so kind of give me give me some details because like I was talking about this the other day with social media of like it's crazy how many of us like live on social media and use it like we would say like use it for business and stuff like that and I would love that.  It's crazy how hardly any of us. I don't think we'll people that are know what the fuck they're doing on social media. Like they're just like copying but I'm doing it like copy and paste and hashtags that are kind of relevant and like posting stuff and be like, oh I need to post this on this day and post this on this day words, like who set like, there's no strategy. We're just thinking we know what we're doing and it's like for some of us that's like our biggest tool and like our biggest thing where were advertising and stuff like that. But we kind of I feel like anyway, there's this thing of social  We're for I want to say our generation mom a little bit older than you but like I said My Generation, it's like a bit of shame in like trying hard on social media is like, oh no, I don't love it. But I just use it. You know, it's like it's like will fucking love it. Like let's not let's not let's not pretend like we all love social media. But also we will love to complain about social media. So it's like when we're using it in this business way people are spending all this time on it, but without actually understanding what they're doing like, oh, I didn't know.  That I was watching a video the other day about how you're supposed to research each hash tag that you use and like it has to do with the engagement. And if you land yourself in the top nine searches right when you say when someone searches that hashtag you the aim is that you want to be one of the top nine posts in that hashtag. So it's not always like just putting a hashtag that gets loads of views because then you'll never be in the top nine because those videos are so popular. So you find that middle group like screwed I was watching and I was like, oh my God like I thought you just fucking  Like hashtag dance hashtag guy let you know what I mean like so it's just crazy. How much how much depth did you go into to get? I mean 16.5 is a pretty reputable following and also I was checking earlier today that like you're getting good engagement like you're getting like 1,000 or so likes on most of your posts, which is I guess a well. I mean compared to the full following that's not a great percentage, but it's still pretty decent compared to what most people get, you know.  I mean, right. So do you how in-depth do you go in like researching and understanding social media and go or is it just kind of like this post cool shit and hope people like it at the beginning it was kind of what you just said. Let's pose cool shit. And yeah, just hope that it grows, you know people catch on to it. And even with that way you paying attention to Trends and stuff like all these type of videos are going viral or it was just what we feel what we did a lot with seeing what works.  Or black previous videos that we've done. Yeah seen that okay. This one worked like seeing why this one popped up more and more of than another video that we've done and things like that. We fought and we saw some common traits. Yeah, like what sort of things we are infinite like like for example keeping in a square yet always works best better than if you have yeah. Yeah type of thing. I think that's something to do with how much space on the screen it feels.  Zup, that's what I would like. For example, if your if my phone is like this I was going to like the cameras are but like if you're doing a video that's like that you're only using this much of space. But when you use the square or the portrait mode, it fills up this much of your screen, right and it catches your attentions ever so slightly more. That's what I've read. I don't know shit so I could be wrong. But but we just found out okay, when we post videos like that it worked more. I don't know like the exact reason why but it does work. Yes to working kind of other things I would contend.  Is containable wearing or music? Yeah things like that didn't type of music that's like for example going around at the time like, you know, especially with afro, yeah is Isaac the one that really got me into the afro thing. Yeah, he's been doing it for years, but now's the perfect time because I froze going around like everywhere and special social media. There's so many like bigger pages and whatnot that promote afro. Yeah, so when they caught on to like one of our videos it was like, okay, that's  So the content that we dropped did they like the like that ideas like for example certain locations that you do your videos that it's not just a thing of our although sometimes it can work but it's not just a thing of just going to put my phone down and record in the bedroom what know some of them can blow up of course, but it's like we always try to think of okay. What can we add what different sceneries can we give people in terms of what we wearing like what you give in to people like me and my brother? We look similar. So you said okay. Am I Kate?  I know things like that and people at all. Look at these twin brothers dancing, you know thinking in reality your house how many years? He's like seven years older than me. So that's like supposing you now on social media moving the night even twins headlines. Oh your engagement just drops tomorrow. It was nobody like we say I already know that. Yeah, I don't think so actually  Like also Isaac's a fucking monster at the moment like refugees. Yeah, mate if you guys go on em, like I'm like a dude. He's been hitting the gym. He is huge. I heard rumors that he has to turn sideways to walk through doors. That's why that's all I had if you go straight is just won't work and he's like broken a few door frames and stuff because of his huge shoulders. So it's a very very yeah. It's a big guy.  Yes, okay. So you start paying attention in these kind of it was the afro stuff that got really soft. So does that do you feel like that forces you to because I know it's a Tyler as well a lot of your afro. Dance. What's the right time I've read dance. Yeah, I'm Robi. I'm from yeah, they blow up a lot. So did that kind of make you feel like are we can't post so much like feedstuff. We got post so much.  Is it like I mean for those that don't know you're so good at a lot of other shit and like you do your hit I was talking about this the other day but your hip hop choreography or you're like kind of stripped down to whatever choreography is is fucking dope as well. But and the so is the light feet your hip or battles, but does it force you to be like, ah, like that stuff isn't as popular as that stuff. So I've got those more of that. Does it kind of dictate what you do? I will I see the mixture once they dictate. Yeah, but it's just like being  About it and kind of thing. Yeah, so it's like when we did the apple stuff it worked. We did that for a while did it for do for a while the pages were reposting and whatnot that gave us a certain crowd. So now I feel like I have a platform to show different sides of me. Okay. Also that kind of going strategically about it. So if I was to do like one after video is going off and obviously people probably want to see more iPhone stuff and I just randomly put like a light feet fingers. Yeah, that is like, maybe they like it. They may not like it but strategically made sense to just  Just keep giving him some afros and I'm kind of like constraint like right in the way of a bit if it's happened. Yeah riding the wave a bit. And then now you after a while using my platform now to show them different sides like say the hip-hop stuff or light Feast off as well. So it's just like showing different sides. Okay, that's interesting and how because I mean the thing is with social media is a lot of people are like they I think I mean I don't to get into this too much now because I have  it stressed about social media about people getting stressed over so familiar that stresses me and I want to talk about this more but with different people as well, but like  I think people think of social media as like oh, this is my like social. This is my circle of friends and blah blah blah and then at the same time they think of it as a business thing and those two things don't work. So then when they are posting this business staff and they feel like maybe what I was suggesting of like that they have to post certain things will being strategic about it and they then go like oh, you know, it's such a shame that I have the pressure to like. I can't just post a thing with me and my girlfriend or blah blah and it's like well you can yeah.  But if you want to use as a business to use it as a business tool, you know, whether or not your relationship and your personal life falls into the realm of like promoting your business through people seeing you as a real person and connecting with you because I think that's also important in social media. We want to see that you're a real person not just a like a faceless busy. You're not Nike on you know what I mean? And even the big brands are starting to get into that of like making you connect with them more on a human level, but they annoys me when people are like, oh I just want to post  so from my personal life and not so good do it then but you're not gonna get all the likes and stuff and that's not there's nothing wrong with that. I don't think it's just even when I'm on Instagram is like there's some things I give a shit about this something. I don't give a shit about like, I might follow you for a certain reason because you're my friend but in the someone else might follow you and not give a shit about your life, but care only because they love your videos and there's nothing wrong with it, you know, and I think yeah people will feel pressure to be like  I'll have to only posters I want to post this and I want to post this and it's just I think it's like a thing of like what are you using it for? Is it a business tool or is it not and so do you ever feel like we're their stuff? We're like you want to share your personal life and stuff or do you ever feel a pressure of that? I mean, I've just cause people that do that. So if you say it now, it'll be really awkward. But now I'm joking. That's the thing is I don't pose as much about my personal life. I don't know if you've I mean, I think you're quite a not be quiet but like you're quite a reserved person in real.  About your personal life anyway, so I think that's kind of reflected. I didn't take it as like a girl because you're doing it for business. You don't post that. I just think that's kind of what you're like in general. You won't know if we all sitting around at dinner with dancers and stuff. You're not going to be like, hey guys. Guess what turbulent emotions I'm going through tonight. You know what? I mean? Like you're Morgan a like save that for when you're really connecting with people. So right so that's kind of what like you said. This one reflecting on the gram is all but  Like he said nowadays Brands and stuff also, like people that showed that side of them as well. So if you think it to grow your Instagram page, sometimes I'm in between like, okay. Should I also give him some of my personal thing or she'll just keep it the way it is now just like lychee content Just Dance things modeling things or whatnot. Yeah. So it's like kind of rip in between is all like should I give him some of the personal stuff which I haven't done yet. Really? What would your classes like personal stuff? Like what would you feel like because like you'll share like  And I like a picture of you or like you hanging out with people. So yeah, like what is you like sharing something personal? Is it like captions? Is it the content of what's in the picture or whatever I think things out my personal I like girlfriend stuff and some things in my family maybe that I just wouldn't reveal to the world type of thing. Okay. I wouldn't I would even know what specific because family is pretty out there as well. Like I said, I can print this stuff. So if ya know about maybe maybe like situations that you'd be  I got We're Just Chillin for us because there's some people on the ground that literally tell everything about their life is going that's like the type of things. I don't think I could do you have any examples not not like other people you don't have to cuss. I'm not going to put you on the spot like that. What is something that like you maybe would have seen someone posted you like feeling comforted with that? I have the same thing. So don't worry, you're not alone. Like I'm not really the type of guy for example to cost people out and make a big fuss. Yeah of things on the ground.  Exactly. Imagine if you're pissed about something. Yeah, like I would get pissed and start ranting every week now. Yeah. Yeah, like in directing people do things like that like Wiley Wiley if you're listening which you're not confident that things like that.  Costume people out every other week on what do you think that is like, but are you because I mean being your friend I'm a bit like an Insider on this but I don't feel like you're that type of person anyway, yeah, you're always the person like when when me and you have conversation, I'm always a person that pissed about shit. Like I'm not necessarily present to ran on Insta either but I will in my personal life if you know, I mean, so it's like a conscious decision of like I don't be a dick on Instagram, but I will come in and be like, oh this person's a fucking asshole, you know what I mean? And whenever we've had these conversations I'll  Like I don't think like well, I know you always like oh, yeah, you know man, but like they're just trying to live their life. You always wanted makes me feel like an asshole because I'm like, oh they're so annoying you'd like. Yeah, but have you thought that you know, maybe they're going through something and I'm like now you made me feel bad, but like so do you think that's a bit easier for you? Because you don't have those. I mean, maybe you're hiding it from me like like that. You don't really have those Tendencies to like feel that you're not that ever much of a person with like hating you or like you don't get annoyed very easily. I do get annoyed of course, but  Like I wouldn't be the type like I'll try to see the bigger picture. Yeah, I'll try to see the bigger picture of things. Like that's why I be like, ah by before maybe they had this or you just is that try not to get too much bad vibes of people because in end of the day is affected me if I do get mad about things that maybe won't even change anything in my everyday life. Yeah. Yeah. So it's like man, I need to take this fucking advice. I just need to I'm just kind of I just kind of differentiate like what things are going to mess around.  If like you know, because if I rant for go of it people just going to take my energy, you know, that is some boss that is some bars again while I hear ya know, that's that's very true. But then so what things do you feel like because for me I think  Like people love relationships online. Yeah. It's like that's one thing. Yeah, and that's one thing that like, I feel a bit conflicted about like I'll post stuff but some people I feel like use it and they like put some lung caption that like took the milk. Yeah Mill KS perfect example, so but at the same time  People love that especially with celebrities and stuff here or people like on that verges they know they're in a new relationship people love that shit. So do you ever feel like you'd get to a state? Do you feel like there's a right way to do that. Do you feel like that's something that you might like use and I'm not saying that's necessarily something wrong with it. Hmm. I just think there's anything wrong. I just wouldn't milk it in the way that I feel some people do but yeah, what's your thoughts on that? If you were like, I don't know if you want to put your relationships their self camera. Yeah. Listen.  This is DM is already full if I mention that he's single. No, but like if you were like had someone like that and you were wanting to be public with it. Hmm. Do you think there's a way you would be like maybe I can work this into the strategy of my Public Image and someone that or not really I feel like  You don't have to hide it type of thing. You don't have to hide it. But then again when people do do it in terms of like milking it. Yeah, I feel like that's a conscious decision. So they know that they're going to pour out there and maybe that you want to certain response to it. So it's just consciously consciously Leslie year. They're doing it to maybe get a response. So for me if I was to put up I wouldn't put out with the conscious decision to milk. It all try get response for I will let you just put up if I felt  I actually put inaudible. Yeah, if I did feel like okay, maybe I am going to give people like a kind of update or what is happening in my personal life. But just at the surface I wouldn't go into deep. Yeah, you know type of thing. So I feel like at that level was still healthy. So if you for example, okay, boom, that's my girlfriend. Love ya XX that wherever there's nothing wrong with feeling proud. And yeah, like you said like putting it all I guess on a surface level and the surface level thing means  Different things to different people but yeah. Yeah, I think for me I was like to think of social media as like there's a big room full of everyone that's following me. And when I post I'm like getting on the microphone and be like guys I've got something to say and then I'm saying it, you know what I mean? So it's like if it's like I've like had a one-year to you ever anniversary of my girlfriend and I'm like, hey everyone. I'm just stopping you to say like fucking love this girl. She's awesome blah blah blah like then. Yeah, like I'm consciously saying it like  With the intent of like I'm announcing this to the world kind of thing. We're running one gives a shit is a different story like probably not but that's my intention behind it. But I think it's when people act like, they're not saying it to people they just it's for me. It's like well if it's for you even fucking post it, I don't know if that's relevant. But just something I was thinking she's spooked. But yeah, I think it's like that thing of like you have to be conscious that you're you're putting that out there putting out there which is what if you're doing it with that intention of like I'm  I'm announcing it's all because I'm proud because I'm happy because I'm like in love because I'm excited like or cuz I'm announcing something because I want you all I'm starting a class next week. I'm saying this because I want you all to come or to tell someone like that's fine. But yeah, I think it's when people are like you said like maybe consciously doing something and trying to get a response. But then also what I guess annoys me is when they act like they're not doing it to get a response. It's like it's fine if you just want to be like yo, I'm in love or yo I'm doing this but  Just can't be real about I guess that's what is a way to be real about social media for sure. Mmm, which I think people don't.  Always hit the nail on the head with but then again, you know through different now you're doing it to me again. You make me feel like an asshole never fucking argue with you and he's like these things always make me immediately say one line and I'm like, yeah, I'm a terrible person. That's factual. Yeah, and it's worse because this is all being fucking recorded. So I can't take this back here. I'm just going to edit that bit out.  I'm not you. All right, cool. And so let's talk about that afro dance stuff because like I said that's been quite a big part of at least the last two years for you. Yeah, and then my cane Isaac would like you guys were doing that before. Yeah. Anyway, even independent of you what's that like in Berlin? Is that a is there a lot of people that are in Shock because I feel like that's quite a worldwide thing. It's like even I was watching Drake's Rap Radar interview. Did you watch it? Yeah only when I was in fact, did you get to where they're talking about?  After Ibiza stuff. No, he was just mentioning like they were talking about him doing being influenced by like crime and iPhone. Oh, yeah, that's not bad things and go but you should watch it and then watch Joe Budden right now about it. It's really funny. But yeah, like he was saying about him help or being a part of it. It's rise and stuff. So I think it is quite like a worldwide thing that everyone's the music as well as the dance is spreading a lot. Is that quite a big thing.  In Berlin and is it like that you get a lot of people that are interested in those classes and stuff more than maybe the other classes or people are really interested in like like I this class classes are full right now a mic a dance classes because everyone sees these don't like Aphrodite is an Instagram they and they just want to be able to dance to it like that or even if they go out they hear a lot of afrobeat and things like that. Yeah Woody's like in the clubs and stuff it clubs. Yeah, all these trendy dances and they just want to be able to be part of that wave so that go to these classes.  Causes a search for and yeah, you know and right now Isaac in Germany Isaac is the man like white fish. It's just hard facts.  TV talent show got to dance. Okay and 2013 and we were doing a fro back then as well. Oh, yeah, so sick people noticed it and people loved it as well. But now that it's become a thing. It's a bit more relevant and they're like, oh that's that shit. That's all I think. Yeah, so they kind of feel like okay we kept authentic. We been doing it even before there was like a big hype around you and then they they feel like okay they can trust us with the knowledge that we provide to them type of thing. Yeah because and also you  You're like your family's from Ghana. Yeah, and you went there. When did you go there John 15:16. How long were you there three weeks? Okay. Yeah, and that was to visit people or just to go or go back through. Yes true. You have family this don't ya we went to visit family and just you know, cuz out the last time I went to Ghana was when I was like well before that trip was when I was young very young. So it was just like I need to go there. Yeah.  So and did you learn anything dance-wise out there or more? Just kind of soaking up the culture soaking up the culture dance-wise. We did like some workshops and talk. We talk a lot of the year and did the show out that two shows out there but not much. We didn't really go and take any workshops and things like that to be honest, but the thing is with us has in our culture. So when we went out we dance a lot even just outside the music.  I was playing it's just part of our culture we done so that's what I soaked up. Yeah, it's not so much like learning to class or whatever. It's just outside music is playing moving that she's the kind of like organic way of a growing right? So then in so, I mean your family is gone and like it's kind of part of your culture and like even do you feel like even being here or being in Germany? You still got that kind of African culture within your family. You still feel like that. So you grew up with that influence. Yeah, even though you want  There yeah pushing because my dad my dad speaks Chi anyhow, I was going to say one thing. I still how long have you been friends for eight years ten years twelve years. I'd say been friends has known each other known each other known each other fences at least 10 years Rove. Yeah. I don't know how to pronounce your second name bro. That's a very sticky question because it's different everywhere you go. I'm really in Ghana you say this is  Renee and name. Yeah, okay trick you actually say Trey Trey Trey Trey. Okay, but it's spelt forever listening. KY e re today today. Okay. So for the sake of other people just getting confused when I say I say in Germany I said Kira eating less a Kyrie. Okay, just whatever whoever's gonna shut people up is is the past right way is and that's the Ghanaian language. Yeah it like it's a name from the Ghanaian language. Yeah, which is called tree.  Like how do you spell that? Here we go. Again wi Twi. Yea against a g. Okay. I'm not going to try. Yeah. Yeah, that's like on a language in your name comes from that. Yeah my surname, right. So Karen, what were you saying? Sorry. What was I forgotten? That's why I said carry on with what you're saying. So you're talking about growing. I know your dad was language in the household as well as German and English. So the mixture of all of that and going to likes a girl named parties and  Like family parties of like kind of a community of gonna yeah Germany or here even in London, so you kind of stay connected with the yeah write music that was playing in the house as well. Predominately glad gonna music also some Reggae and stuff. Yeah. So definitely grew up in the like very musically inclined household. Yeah. Yeah. Thanks. And so now that I mean now that this is like a I mean, I know you're going to have such a Angelic take on this but like school.  You're going to make me feel horrible what like it's become like a massive hype around the world. So you've got people in like London in I mean London's of not great example, but you've got people that are like very far removed from the culture of the thing right doing these dance styles. I'm really like even teaching it and like living it and whip the dance styles but maybe not necessarily the culture behind it. What's your take on that? Because I feel like this is a really interesting question, especially  The afro stuff and like I have the same questions with Danton even hip-hop, but like how I mean it's one thing people loving the dance and finding it: blah blah, but then is there a point where it's like you're kind of taking the danced are making money from it without caring about the people who made it or where's the line of cultural appropriation? And that sort of thing do you find or do you not really think it's like everyone is free to love everything they want to kind of thing.  That's probably more towards the views I have on it. Yeah, right because first of all, I didn't create it on style exactly like oh, I don't know anyone that did like I've like you see afro come from many different countries. It goes a long way back. So there's a thing as well. Like I feel like afro is it's not like like even with hip-hop we say like it came from New York and then, you know, you have these influences in LA and all other places, but it's America that we kind of agree a lot of hip hop started.  America right it wherever the influences came from but after is not one country. It's like is named after a continent. Yeah, you know, I mean so it's like that's a lot of different influences all in one thing. Yeah. It's like cuz there's many different dances that like the term that a lot of people use is like say after Fusion or four beads just to put all these different styles that were creating different countries into one term that one umbrella term, you know, and it's like if people I don't know.  Oh in Serbia web are doing afro. It's like yeah, why not kind of things like I don't have a take on it when I say they're not supposed to do it. When as long as they they do in a respectful way because I don't know if you're Russian think that was a big deal. I mean that was done so that right. Hello twerking or yeah. Yeah, they say it was fucking nothing but not throw. That fucking was like a black facing right? Yeah.  Would do fuck man makeup and whatnot, you know, that's like that's taking it. So, okay. So that was like very extreme example, but that was them like taking the pit or even if they weren't doing it because that's where the goal was like saying. No, I wasn't trying to be disrespectful and it's like well that's even worse but like that's a very extreme example of like this is so obvious that you shouldn't fucking do this stuff. Yeah for anyone that doesn't know what we're talking about. There was a twerking class competition in Russia petitioner.  Yeah, and this woman, I don't know. It's like she is and I don't want to like give her props on here. But I like her she was teaching the class. I guess she did a demo with like a big helmet on which was like a in blackface and was twerking and doing afro dance committee afro. Yeah African women who have that dance? Yeah fro and then was confused by the fucking uproar it caused but you're like, that's a very extreme example, but  is there a  is there a line when it's like okay you're  From like Spain teaching a gun at you're not going to be in like does it matter to you or you don't because like I've heard different opinions, I don't quite know where I stand for me. Like is it for me? It's not that big of an issue as long as it's like you kind of just do your research. Yeah, you know in terms of what in terms of like doing the dance style properly. Yeah. Yeah like the vocabulary that you give out and things like that like the type of music that you dance today. Just kind of like in tune with what the coaches about.  And this test I carries and things like that, you know that you're like doing it in as from a place of appreciation appreciation and rather than taking the piss. Yeah, like in terms of appreciation and just knowing what like what you're doing type of things like with hip-hop latches knowing okay, you're kind of doing your research on that specific step or whatnot like knowing maybe came from New York and yeah knowing that I don't know different like vocabulary that you put out there.  There and just trying to get the essence of the move and things like that, you know, so it's not just that you give out like water down steps of my to the people, but you can see that you really actually into it you can you can just tell when someone Downs is a fro like he's really with it or he's just trying to imitate things as that they stole from Instagram whatnot. Yeah. I know most dancers you can see that nice straight away. Hmm interesting and would you yeah.  yeah, I'm kind of like split I guess sometimes I'm like, I'm not sure how I feel about this and sometimes I'm like, yeah, why not let people live I guess because that way it's like if people  Like like who's the question is who's going to be able to say someone else? Serbia is not allowed to teacher after Workshop who? Yeah, because that like, I don't know for like  Hippo whoever you could be like lingo. I don't know. Yeah, but you that started this but for afro, who's going to be like you're not allowed to do write knowing it wasn't like named creators have no name create is like there's no one. It's more cultural dances its cultural dancers, you know, even if you go to Ghana and you're from Serbia, and you ask people out there to to if you're safe with Serbia, I keep saying sir, but very very random crap, I think because you went to Siberia where it's not he's not just attacking Serbia.  Doing a flow which are for though. Alright, even if you go out there to Ghana and you ask people out there to teach you the traditional dancers, they're not going to be like no like it's just off this allowed to dance it. They'll teach you opening and be happy. Yeah for you to do it, you know, and then okay and it's another thing if you then go back and start work should be like yo, I'm the this is what I mean, but like the way that's sort of line of like, okay, you've gone to this place taken the stuff and then you come back and you're making money from it. Mmm while maybe  These people aren't making money from it and they're just like living their life and like oh, yeah, like we talked this guy some set of meanwhile, you're making a business of it like right? Yeah. I don't know where the land I'm saying this from a place of a guy who my family is half Indian half American white American and I do hip up and it's not my coach I did. I mean like and I'm very aware that I'm like a guest in the culture but that's kind of why it's something that is on my mind because I'm like, what was the line of this like no matter how  Really? I treat hip hop or that someone else might treat afro, so it's like it's not my culture and I'm making a living off it. So yeah, I don't know something to definitely think about that to me is like as long as like I said you try get this is over you're really involved. You can connect with maybe the community that was built the African Unity that was built now in Europe or whatever, you know, you will get your you will get your respect from the right people to everything and then yeah people will know people that you're like not  not taking the piss out when you're trying to take it seriously and you're trying to care. Yeah type of thing here and you feel like a lot of people feel that way in the kind of let's say like community of people that do afro dance who are actually from Africa. Do you feel like a lot of them feel like that or do you feel like you hear some people being like like is it split decision that some people are like no you shouldn't do it. If unless you're like from the place or from that culture with her out. I was distracted.  So good. Nana, I was laying in your because I'm not in that community at all never taken a class in it or whatever. But do you feel like in the community of people that do afro? Yeah that that's kind of the general feeling is everyone's pretty accepting and like yeah, you want me to try and make an effort and you really care then live your best life kind of thing. I feel for ya because I feel like those that are really people see those that are really dope when those are the ones that usually get booked. You know, it's like but in most cells  Type of thing. I don't think they're not not many people brave enough to even give like say afro class just like that because I froze a very new to have certain grooves and certain flows that not that are not easily thanks imitated or faith, you know, so people can instantly see if you're just trying to like kind of making a fool of yourself and you want blow up unless you got yeah. Yeah, so I feel like yes, I'm just yeah, I think this is definitely a conversation to be continued.  For me personally whether or not on the podcast, but with other people of other stars, I think this is something I'm really interested in of like coming from someone who's like I said what I think there's a slight difference with hip-hop because there is a hip-hop culture in the UK now and where we came into it like I grew up around Grime, I grew up listening to like run when it first started. There's like stuff that came from the UK that  I guess was part of my culture if that makes sense. Yeah, yeah as much as that culture came from somewhere else it then developed itself in here, but I don't feel like there's an independent and I may be saying some bullshit but I don't feel like there's an independent culture of Afro dance or because like say you said you went to parties and stuff in the UK, but it's not African parties are still people who are African doing those dances because they're from Africa.  Create a community here. Does that make sense? It's not like the the UK hip hop culture. I was around wasn't American New Yorkers who came over and started rapping here. It was people that had you know, like develop that culture after being influenced by America. Does that make sense? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so there's not you know what I mean? Like am I making any sense? Yeah. No, you know, it's just something that interests. I don't really have like a question or it's just something that interests me of like, okay, where's the lion of when are we?  Just doing someone else's thing and making money off it and not doing much back or yeah, interesting that like side note thing like when I was in Thailand, I went to a fro Polly. Okay full of life. Just Thai people. Oh, that's what was dope. Yeah. It's like they'll play like proper deep like afrobeat type of songs like yo, like I know what I'm doing. Yeah. Yeah.  like like me my brother and like  To free our people probably like the only black stare body proper like enjoying the culture, you know sing along to the songs and stuff which are fools. Don't just want to put that out there. Yeah. That is no. Yeah. Yeah, but then it's like I guess they with that it's like there was there's no like time moves in afrobeat that they've like crazy that I mean like crime is something that came from London, I guess or like you can't least. So that's like it was It's a UK creation, even though that the roots came from like somewhere else and  We had our own roots in a garage and stuff. But the hip-hop side of that came from America. We then create something of our own version. So there's no like Thai version of Africans. They were doing the African version. You know what I mean? So that's what me being like, okay cool. Like and I all that to say I fucking love when culture spread and people like can appreciate that. My life wouldn't be what it is without hip-hop or without a lot of these influences, but it's just something on my mind. I'm like, okay where  Should we draw the line? What should we be doing to like kind of I guess give back or whatever. Hmm But yeah, it's interesting. Yeah the kind of leave that out in the air because I don't really have an answer for it. And it's always good to end the podcast on the deep note make everyone depressed. No. Yeah. No, I mean it's I think it's definitely something important to think about especially if it's not your culture, even if it is no like necessarily answer or you're not taking action straight away for me. It's like all right. This is something I want to think about and have on my mind and speak about of like  Should what should we be doing? Should we be conscious of their stupid? Like I don't want to have conversations like you with you and with other people and be like, what do I do? But yeah, but now that's the first type that you're very like open and sharing guy and that's like I'll cook I'll compensate you. This is not just for the Pod Kyle conversations always go like this me being like isn't this fucked up and you're like Mom not really like everyone has their own life and love is great.

Say some shit. He's ruining them like that. No, but for oh, it's nice to have like friends that like pull you in different directions and I would just encourage your your how are you are and kind of challenge like we always think of I guess friends challenging each other in the sense of like you think one thing in your like. Oh, why do you think that way but it's like you challenge me in a way of like   Making me not be such an awesome. Well, I tell you we're not by saying that you're wrong about stuff the more like well, this is how I'm going to live my life. So have you considered this? Yeah, but it's good because I feel like that's where we kind of call it. No, I do it the action you're doing has nothing to do with anything. Like I don't know what this is where we like share each each other. Oh my gosh, I can cut this up. No, but we're not so lucky.  Figure it out bro, but at this point because you're saying we seen two different points, but I also take your point into account. A lot of times Well, it helps me think differently.

Okay, so  So today we're talking about a Colombian case have we ever done a calming case? I don't know.  I don't think so because I've definitely started on some Colombian outlines. Like I have like mental notes about Colombian cases. And this was one of them but like I don't think so if done Venezuela, no, we don't many many. Yeah, I don't think maybe I should have sang Shakira then I feel very no no.  Yeah. No, I think it was a good choice the song. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Mhm. So with Columbia, like I feel like I wanted to do something that is not drug related for like, you know, the first time Colombian case because like you search Latin American to cram you only get Pablo Escobar basically. Yeah Google so yeah, I mean Google is not a good thing.  To keep finding cases for me especially. So today we're talking about Leanne acid who I mean this is a big case like this is recent history like, you know past like 10 years, I think case that like struck not only like the whole column you like the whole country, but you know, regionally, it's like I'm sure people are like still very upset about it and it's like the big big big  One is every time something happens regards to a Twitter Twitter like explodes. So it's a huge one and we're tackling it today Oprah do it justice because it's huge. So this outline was based on articles by tobacco pulled Zoella Universal and a documentary by El rastro, which we definitely recommend for you guys to watch because I mean not only it's available on YouTube, but there you can listen  To her parents friends and siblings talking about her you can watch footage of her like doing stuff is really cool. And you also can get more insight into like the case and evidence, etc. Etc. By investigators. You can hear the investigators talking about it. So that's really cool, you know always movie time with Suspiria we can watch the documentary so they get so Leah Patricia nasa.gov idea.  Born on December 17th. 1983 instance Alejo Colombia. She had a huge personality. She was super quirky and friendly and honest her brother said that she would just like up and do stuff. She wouldn't think too much about what others would think of her when she was doing so she just like super spontaneous super fun and nice and fun to be around so she had a shit ton of friends. She was the oldest of three siblings and was super  Super close to her family. She was 26 and she was attending the Universidad Del Norte anybody Kia for law actually, so she's almost at me. Yeah, and she was on very last semester, you know? No I because it said like she was on her very last semester just bummed me out. I feel like almost done with college. So she was working at the policy decision.  Incense Alejo, so I don't know if you have to do that and us but stuff you should know it was doing like a residency med school buffer law school. So she was sick of working in the field before she was allowed to get her degree like so it's looser school. Yeah, you have like, yeah, you have to work during the Summers but I so she was gets like necessary. Sorry. I don't think it's like necessarily like I don't think you're obligated to do it in order to become a  Here but by working every summer in law school. You have a better chance of Landing a job after you graduate. So yeah, yes full. Yeah, so but with her case really she was working. I don't know what she was doing there, but she was they refer to as practicing law. So she was probably getting some real hands-on experience at the policy that you see here, and it was I think don't quote me on.  On that but it was I think it was mandatory for her graduation. There was a test after the judicial tutor. Yeah thing. So, yeah, she was like enough like at the end of that prepping for the test. So like the bar exam like be Brazil. Yeah, like and then after that she would I mean or base something that you do after you're done with school. I know you can do it but now or two because my best friend's fiancee he  Go to law school in Brazil and he did our bit before he graduated. He passed the test that you're graduating. You're any good luck dude. Yeah, not everybody. Does that though? No not let this is clearly the smarter round says someone who doesn't know anything about nothing anyways, but with Leah, she was finishing up her lie since your Twitter, no, sorry. Yeah this institute and then no should be sure to the only since it to the  Sorry, and after that she have a test and then after the test, she would graduate basically like I think she would have to finish the test and go like pass the test to graduate. So it's all like, you know sequence of events so in but that's in 2009. I'll go back to 2000 because we're talking about her anyway, so in 2003, she started dating one pop of the logos who sorry I keep saying who fucking aisle, so there are  Kind of wrapped up in the relationship and decided they were going to get married pretty fast. I don't know how fast the relationship but they're mine was kind of made up and no one could tell them otherwise their family is approved of the relationship. Don't get me wrong, but they thought it was a bit too early for a wedding, but they got married anyways.  Thanks, Joyce. Yeah, and their plan was to get pregnant. So Mary didn't get pregnant and ASAP and that's what happened because by 2004 they had a daughter they sound like me but when I was a teenager anyway, so after a few years their relationship wasn't the greatest The Clash a lot and fight and go on was growing distant since he traveled way too frequently for  Work, of course as it turns out. He was really working something else working on something else doing the trips. Mmm sex. He was having an affair.  She was devastated when she found out in two thousand seven ish. She divorced his ass, but it took a toll on her. She lost a ton of weight. It was really tough on her. So as with everything time goes by and she's able to you know, rebuild herself up and just like become a badass again. She went back to school changed her hair as we all do after a breakup. Everybody changes her hair.  Even it's if it's a little bit and got a boob job. Now get this her and a surgeon Javier Gonzales became instant friends at first. He was kind of a confidant but the relationship develop into something romantic after some time who imagined that I would love to like being a relationship with my plastic surgeon like I would get so much work done for free. Anyway this time it was a little different with no rushing at all. They dated for a while.  They're coming out as a quote-unquote formal couple which is like his words. They both had daughters from previous relationships and the families Blended pretty well, they even travel together. Why did I just think of that episode of the office when Michael photoshop's is picture magic arrows Christmas car why I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry. I think the minute I read that even travel together - that scene came into my head. Okay. I'm sorry. Anyway, they're doing great. But but but a big but almost as big as mine and carols but not that big Javier had an ex-girlfriend who didn't take The Break-Up very well, and she was trying to raise hell on the relationship. She was verbally attacked lien public Steven.  I made some serious threats that prompted Leah to end the relationship. She told her parents like a day before she died that she was a grown I'm grown woman with a kid. She needed to make good choices stay in a relationship wasn't worth the drama, which I totally agree like dude. I don't you love her like this is yeah so nice so good. I mean like it's a good relationship. This is working, but I'd I can't I don't have to deal with this and she does like umi's  Thanks. Yeah, like he's strong, you know, it was really good. So now it's May 29th 2009. She tells her dad that she's going to meet with a classmate later on the day as far as we understood there were exchanging study material sump report or Preparatory stuff for the test. You know, some sources said like he had some quite the questions that are being to test some or the sources said some stuff like something else. Some people said they were like,  Doing a project together irrelevant. They were like exchanging something. Okay, so he didn't she didn't really say with the friend was though so at 7 a.m. She got on a taxi and when her job Palacio de la giustizia. So now this might seem a little unusual for a lot of our listeners, but Lea was in constant communication with their parents, so they not only knew where she was at all times but had active  Taxes are at all times.  So keeping that in mind they get a little alarmed after she gets silent after she goes silent for two hours.  But I mean, it's two hours. They just brush it off because she might just be busy. But yeah hours and hours passed and she still not picking up the phone. Hmm. But like 1:00 p.m. Her mom's already calling have years mom to check if she knew where Leah was and then she called have yet and all of us. She called them first free. Yeah, I know like yeah, that's what your Hound thing. That is such a thing. Yeah, so she  All have yet and she wasn't with have year so he joined the word party they were all trying to call and she'll still in my ear at 2 p.m. Lea cell phone stopped ringing because it had been turned off. Oh, yeah, the parents didn't went to her workplace to investigate. They find out that she had left earlier with an unknown young men. Now Leah's mom was a former judge. So she might have used her Connections in her favor, but she was able to obtain.  Security camera flew camera footage that showed Leah leaving with a man wearing a blue shirt and holding a folder.  So they show the video song her classmates in one is able to identify the man. Was it water Jose de los acantilados Conte Contreras. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. So the video shows the entrance of the building and also access to the stairway like a door when the stairway is. Yeah, and we can see it wardo entering the building am then walking out a few minutes later. So the appears at  805 out of the staircase and walking out of the building wearing khaki pants and a pale pink shirt very big cash.  That's business casual for you guys at on this animal passion. So it's still at the plaza toward you you just like sounded like Tom Haverford. I called chicken parms chicken parms pizza biscuits. Okay guys.  So still the past you sorry. Yeah, so the parents are told the policy here and they talked to her colleagues and they tell them that the time that she left. She had been in a brief phone call and she will say okay over there by then hang up and she told her colleagues that she'll be right back. She even left her purse at the office.  So she clearly didn't think she was leaving. Yeah, it was probably like to Intrigue. I'm very intrigued. Yeah, I wonder what's gonna happen to break up this sub downstairs. Why did I immediately think about food? That's just how I think Subs leave your purse. Yeah. Yeah, you tell me there's a sub downstairs. I'm leaving. My nephew's upstairs like you guys chill here. Like anyway, I did that today, but it was only for like two minutes.  It's so I could get some hot dogs anyway.  Oh, it's me. Sorry. So when the search party finds out about it, what don't they contact him? And he pops why the Palacio at around 3:00. He doesn't know where Leah is straight up dead end. He tells them that they left a philosopher earlier on his motorcycle. But before they reach their destination, she got a call and had to cancel the plans. They had made. Can you smell that? Mmm-hmm. She apologized and put a rain check on it, basically.  Later on that day. He went back to the police tried 11 to pick her up again, but she wasn't there. That is true. By the way, he actually went there at 11 and she was already gone by mid-afternoon. The family is driving around since Italy. Hope looking for Leah. They're organizing prayer groups getting started on the missing persons Flyers all her friends and family are involved there thinking might be a kidnapping then they finally contact police.  After all of this now, let's address that. Okay. She went missing at around eight or nine mid-afternoon. They're already prayer groups and missing were no police isn't this like the fastest? No, but it was actually very effective on this thing, you know because they're always on her and it was not like, you know, a suffocating like family situation know like it was always like it was just the way they were, you know, so the  This is going to be like this why they were able to solve this case really fast because they're all on it.  So it investigation starts right away, they talk to Eduardo and he says the same stuff. He had said before and Leah had a lot of people that were directly involved in her life, obviously, so that is a pretty long interrogation list. I comes and Leah still Missy that is absolute torture for her parents interrogation list. The investigators had was more like a suspect list really just a reminder.  Leah had a sour ex-husband a recent ex-boyfriend. Adam was still looming around for some reason. She had a weird guy pick her up at her job and the crazy ex-girlfriend with the threats and shit. That's a field day for police and also  Also on top of all of that. She had a soccer sorter. She had been getting these weird messages from an unknown number telling herself. Like, oh you look pretty today. I like your outfits Etc these P She gonna figure out who was sending her to text. So it's close to noon the day after Lee goes missing police working on the suspects. They're able to cross out the ex-girlfriend right away, but they're still working hard on a rest paying special attention to Javier.  Actually, it was the main suspect that's when a woman walks into the station. She is losing stea Romero Eduardo's housekeeper. Oh shit, dude. Oh mmm.  so  let's put a pin on that for a second and talk about it was a bit shall we so it water was 24 from San Marcos. That's like two hours from since Alejo and he had been living with his sister Ximena and her husband. Akela is for five years at the La Palma neighborhood.  I mean he's going to school it's insulated her like a bigger city, but like yikes, you know, so he was a classmate of the has and he was kind of known for being super smart. He was the kind of person who would like reading Tire books in a few days and had kind of brag about this. But anyways, he looks like an evil snail. That's the only way I can describe it. I've tried to do like that popsugar thing that you like put your picture and it tells you what kind of celebrity look like.  And here the people that popped up it was ludicrous doesn't look nothing like Ludacris Robert Downey jr. And like Morgan Freeman. He's not black even so I don't know what's up with his face like that. Three reason of this be like because like even ludicrous and we're from a war like black licorice. Oh cool water them and you tell me I think I look like Ludacris more than he does.  Jesus  yeah, it looks like he works in IIT doesn't he look like a snail? Yeah, like I evil evil face. Yeah person. I don't know. Anyways, we're going to have a picture of him on Instagram.  Huh?  So loses stay logged tells the police that it was actually bought Leah home on the 29th at around 8:30. So right after she was picked up at the policy. Oh, so she was working and kind of lost track of the to while she made a rate through the house cleaning. She made her way to the master bedroom and it's vital kind of popped out of it like his head and he was like, hey,  Loose can you buy some soda at the store real quick? And she was like sure I don't know. Who were you guys doing in there whatever so it's kind of weird and kind of condescending but like, you know, whatever and she comes back and it when the door is locked like the front door to the house is locked and he knocks he opens and he was like, all right, here's some more money go buy me some cookies. I hate this fucking guy just for that but Tim.  This later. She makes it back to the house and she saw it why little tide sitting on his motorcycle with a blue Barrel between his legs?  But didn't expect that. Right so it will take a 32 gallon container and it isn't like a metal drum. It's like a plastic-like track. It looks like a trash can like of a big trashcan plastic not metal. I know it's it's like a big bucket. Anyways, the bucket had a lid on it so she couldn't see if there's was anything inside. So Eduardo took the fuck off with a bucket basically on the bike like, you know,  Trying to bounce Ellison. I'm just picturing out of that and it sounds like disasters this all actually happened. We don't make anything out of it like on a documentary. They have like a reenactment of it. It's possible but like, you know,  I don't know. I feel like there's got to be a more effective way to dispose of Honor exact. So we're not getting ahead of ourselves anyways.  So anyways loses teller she went back to work. Just clean the house. Whatever just a hiccup. She hadn't seen Dia lift that leave the house. So she just assumed that she was still inside the master bedroom bedroom. Of course, you probably thought they were just having sex in there or something. So that's why it was sent around and so she needs to clean the master suite so she knocks on the door three times, and there's no answer. She calls for deleting.  Side, there's no answer and she opens the door and walks in and sees.  A blood-soaked metres. So the sheets had been all removed and I was fresh Blood on the middle of the bed like right dead center the blood fresh, but what?  Yeah, three hours later. It's hard to comes back with this bucket and starts cleaning. He washes the bucket his clothes his shoes the whole area everything at least it didn't make her washer weren't ya mean ya at around noon Ximena and achilles get home. They asked losses tell about what happened in their bed. Can you imagine walking your bedroom? And it's like blood. Yeah, right. So she tells them that she doesn't know.  He has to do with it. Why didn't you ask me ask him, you know, so that's a good guess like not getting involved. But that's a good fuck off answer from a man. What do you think is mean like, why would you ask me? I just clean things. I don't like them dirty. It's like a little weird because house all day exactly. Yeah, so they don't call the police, but they're very worried which  I'm sorry, but like if I found blood on my mattress out of nowhere, I'd be like I'm never sitting on that mattress ever again. And yeah the next day but a timely has picture was like everywhere. They showed a picture to lose. She recognized her as the lady who had been at the house almost immediately. I feel is takes her to the police station. Please go shooter house where they examined the mattress and find a blood.  Obviously, but also clumps of hair.  They find the bucket and notice that the bottom was broken something that would probably happen. If you put something really heavy inside the little bucket drumroll type of thing. They also find out what kind of egg rolls or something. What would you be exact or Rock several hammers exactly. They also find a blood-stained hammer. They start building up the case against Eduardo. And the main thing is to prove that Leah could fit into the bucket if I  Woman that was about Leah sighs. She happened to be one of the investigators by the way. How fun.  Because we're going mourners would set wouldn't set until all hours after the death. It is very possible to put someone in a bucket which I can just but picture the bones like cracking like, I don't know. I'm sorry. No, I mean she could fit like, you know, like with Annie search has just sitting in the bucket.  Yeah, this is the kind of bucket that you like fill up with water and let you like kids play in it, which I've been inside that kind of bucket.  So that's nice ruined a nice childhood memory for me this case. I feel like my grandpa's won't problem those things too. Yeah, it's like a big blue plastic. Yeah, like a water gallon the like you yeah. I know what you're talking about. I feel like yeah anyway, so they moved to find a body because they want to charge him with homicide instead of like kidnapping so they get a hunch that Lea might be at a nearby lake turns out that she wasn't  The next the next day. Oh, sorry. Go ahead the next day. They move to First Eduardo. Anyways, that's funny because what's funny about that is that it will actually calls the police and tells them to come for him basically saying that he wants to be investigated because he's innocent.  What a cocky asshole. Yeah that come for me. But yeah, so catch me outside. He tells them that the blood is really just because they had that sex on the bed. I don't know what kind of sex his Irene but not that I'm going to write that much blood or sex. Mmm. So he's also says that she left the house on her own after he was gone, basically.  Contradicts his first statement that she left the motorcycle all that and that counts as evidence against him.  So he was arrested only three days after Leah went missing on the 4th. He's already in front of a judge with the whole city out protesting to try to avoid the he gets away with murder.  So this all happens fast and people get really involved which is cool. The whole Community is like pissed. I love it. The police actually had to escort him out of the courthouse with riot gear, you know, like those like big like Shields. Yeah. Yeah to avoid a lynching because people were pissed off rightfully. So by then he's playing the fifth. They don't have the fifth in a Million.  Columbia but you know like he's it's not talking much doing it. Yeah. Yeah, and he's a he's like super cocky and still insisting that he didn't do anything. They in court show a picture of Leah to him trying to get like a guilt reaction or him and he just like Smiles just laughs.  Yeah.  So the police is using attention the case is getting to try and find out what happened. So they published the pictures of the involved and the bucket and an architect. I was working at a construction site recognized the bucket.  He had seen Eduardo on the bike with a bucket. It's just like they don't forget, you know can imagine just like seeing him like yeah, cuz that's been passed down this fandom.  Like that, like sounds we have you seen those pictures of like 20 people in one motorcycle. Yeah, that's exactly what I think. This must have looks like yeah, so he parked in front of him an empty lot of the Venetia neighborhood of since Alejo and he spent about 45 minutes. They're the guys like looking. He's like one of those like Grandma's the say it's like by the gate like walk out and fighting Street. Yeah. He's  Definitely does not does not have like anything to do that day. Like I wonder when the guy with the book it's gonna leave so yeah, they go and search the lot and they find Leah buried in the shallow grave wrapped up in the bed sheets and in the fetal position with only a thin layer of dirt and waist covering her.  Nice, we should have been joking before we said that so at Topsy confirmed that Leah died as a result of asphyxiation and that she had also been on the back with a hammer. She had been raped the guy had like broke her spine in several places with hammer. So that's where the blood came from the official narrative is that it wardo arranged the meeting with Leah to give her the papers.  And she thought that he was going to show up with them. But instead he took her to her his house to get the paper. So there he tried to rape her. She struggled and he used such Force against her that he ended up strangling her and he didn't rape her after that because he killed her before he had the chance which fucking sucks. So he didn't put her inside the bucket which was used as a clean laundry basket usually at the house and he traveled on his motorcycle with  the bucket for 15 minutes until he gone to the empty lot located not even 500 feet from her house from her home. You could actually see the empty lot from like her parents house. Oh my God, that's so sad. That's the most heartbreaking part of this case now.  Cuz there cuz like they're looking for her and she's like literally right there. It's like soak the closest. So yeah.

See you later.  Pull your obsessed with her.  So during his trial like on the do you plead guilty part? He did a really nice speech. He said that this was all a joke. His family was Torn to Pieces. His dad had been threatened his mom was almost dying because having a son in jail is worse than death itself to a courtroom filled with Leah's friends and family. Can you imagine  the size of the jackassery that you like  He pled not guilty obviously, but he was sentenced to 29 years in jail for the murder The Disappearance and the highly of the body. He has never confessed. But he has said that he accepted the charges even though he still maintains his innocence.  After an appeal, he was able to get three years and one of his charges out of the sentence today. He's in a maximum-security prison, but he's able to get out for we think 72 hours every year a benefit. That is a right for Colombian prisoners who served at least 3/4 of the sentence except that he really hasn't. Yeah, he was he was gift to that benefit like super early and no one else why  Yeah, so it's not only Brazil to has the freaking fucked up sentencing system because of good behavior. He's eligible for parole in 2020, which is literally next year. Mmm. And if not, he'll be out by 2030 that's like 20 years after shield and probably exactly killed a mom in 2009. Remember 2009.  Guys remember how like recent 2009 is?  Think Jesse ever hitting a glass table think what else happened 2009 like oh my God, Katy Perry kissed a girl this 2009. That's like yesterday. I moved to America yesterday steps like because exactly 19. Anyway, it's like no, you know, yeah. Oh my God makes me so mad.  There are a few question marks about the case including water Leah died at the empty lot or on the bed. And also what it was premeditated. Which if you ask me I think it was if he was like stalking her this whole time, but do you want to say what you think I mean?  I think at least I hate the shape.  At least a rape was premeditated because Lea didn't think that she was going to go anywhere with him clearly, but he did you know, and he took her home to get stuff but get this allegedly and I couldn't find too much corroborating like especially car sourcing and you know many sources saying this, so, please don't call me, but the empty lot was owned by Eduardo's brother-in-law the kiwis.  So that plus the fact that it was located where it was located that close to the appearances house her house. Yeah that for me kind of seals it they was premeditated. Yes. Yeah, and also, I mean not I mean he was definitely trying to work an alibi like him like the whole thing of him actually going back to be as workplace at a round the  Same time that you know like a few hours after before the parents went.  You know you basically like finished dumping her body and when like right to the workplace to try to like a fucking piece of shit. Yeah trying to get his story, right? So yeah, the his brother-in-law he lives by the way. He's like the DEA.  Like oh, yeah. Oh so that explains a little bit. I think I mean explains like why I think he got them, you know get out of jail card early. So Nia was killed on a DA's bed when you think about that kind of thing those terms.  yeah, that's like  and the outcome is like not even.  Comparable to the gravity of the case. Yeah, not comparable. But like it's not enough. So the overall overall sentiment about this case not only with the local community, but also with Leah's family is that it / AC impugn basically being able to leave the prison this early in the sentence and I'll be in to be eligible for parole barely 10 years after the murder is just bananas her brother has vented on  Social media about this and I think it's good to end this with something. Her dad has actually said so he said quote we lost our daughter. We haven't seen her in ten years a person like Eduardo should wrought on the soil which definitely doesn't translate well to English, but the sentiment definitely does he should just vanished Rock on the soil upon the land and work as a fertilizer.  That's my final position. Honestly, I say this from the bottom of my heart judge me all you want listeners, but I seriously hope that whenever he gets out his ass gets Lynch. Dude, you guys are gonna watch the documentary right? Scroll down the comments. You'll see a bunch of people like a bunch of Mexicans like oh boy. How is this case happened in Mexico? The guy would be basically doesn't membered in prison first week, man, who would not have  Which I think is hilarious thing to say, but like but you know, I know definitely hope that he dies. Yeah.  So yeah, I mean, I'm sure those things happening come on in prison too. He's probably like when the high-profile, you know Taemin bear, but call me. Yeah. Yeah, I don't Colombian through my bed where they play Shakira all day. That's a point. Everybody's hips. Don't lie. You're sleeping sleeping in the middle of the night and all of a sudden check it out. Check it out you like, you know, that's your punishment. You can only reach out. I'm  We had to wake up like dancing. Yeah, he is. Yes. Can you imagine that can you actually give day woke up people in prison would like frano mass dance routines that people had to do it like 5:00 in the morning. Oh my God. I'm like picture some people some picture, you know, I'm pushing like gar stress with last like the Village People. Wow, the cells. Let me run a point prison, but please I'm happy.  Get some awesome ideas.  Some people would enjoy it but like other people that's like the worst punishment for them. I feel like after like serving a ten year sentence that's definitely punishment. Like you enjoyed the first week, you know, but then when they start like doing the same songs all over again every day get on your feet get on and let it slide to the left slide to the right exactly.  Oh my God. Oh my God.  so  you guys  Oh, man. Are you still picturing? You know, do you do you watch American Dad? No.  Fuck there's a there's an episode of American Dad.  Where they dance so I'm gonna send you this episode later. But basically there's a dictator that forces people to dance to Bananarama. I'm like everybody has your day is like all day 24/7. So this is what I'm picturing it. I'm gonna send this to you. Definitely. I'm sorry. Sometimes my chair cracks. That's just not a good quality chair and you know, it's well made for my Brazilian body.  I like my chair at work keeps like doing this and I'm like, yes, please break right here so I can get Workers Compensation. You're not broken my ass bone before right you have I have yeah, how did you do that? Oh my God.  Okay Sobek story.  I just got your episode here. But anyways, I was like 11 man. I was like going to field trip to the caves. We're going like to the caves, you know, and so we're going to the caves and that was like one of them. I think it was. Oh my God, what was the name? The name of the case was agua. Suja. Dirty water doesn't even if the cave so there ya are as we want to cover the Java which is the the devil's cave because there's like a face.  Face that looks like the devil like on the on the one of the walls but that's like a light cave because you have like rails and stuff you have like path. But dirty water was like Caves at the whole thing. You have like water up to your 11-year old ways. But anyways on the way back, we're like super wet, you know, and I'm going to go through like this hike, you know, and it was like wet stone and it was like, oh my God. No, it was like a I was like super concentrated on like not  Alan right and they will take this piece that it was like a totally go down like some like the move like a stair like staircase like, you know, like and I was like so Mario she loves him Donkey Kong like stairs and  I felt like I got out of the stairs and like I was like, yeah, I did and I fell on my ass like sitting out back just slam down. I broke my ass, but I didn't find out until after the 10 hour bus ride back home. So my ass was very in your broken ass for 10 hours. I sat on my broken ass for 10 hours and my ass was injured and then we went to a doctor like  But wasn't even a bone doctor orthopedist. This is a person that actually exists. His name was Kimball the name of the Kimball but King ball with a W Kimball Kimbo. Yeah. Dr. Kim Bo so, dr. Kimble ordered me to sit on a thing that looks like a float like a donut Lifesaver. Yeah. So for me a very bullied eleven-year-old showing up this  school with a little float thing was not nice on my making friends thing. So yeah, I had to leave the school the Eddie another your because I was not having you the time but that's a story for later. Yeah, but at least your parents were supportive and like took me to the doctor. Yeah change you, you know change schools. Oh no total because a lot of toads. Yeah because like like at least not my parents but like my grandma  Whole raised my sister for a few years like my sister tells me that if she got beat up at school and she came home. She was like, oh Grandma's on beat me up. My grandma beat her up and be like, this is what you get for coming home crying instead of being who ever beat you up, you know? Yeah, so  Your parents could have been like yeah toughen up. Yeah, so I mean they wanted me to be the one to change me like change classes, you know, would you can do them Brazil? Because if you guys don't know it's like the same class and then the teachers rotate instead of yeah, the class is rotating here like it is in America. So she wanted to change me to a different class and she was like, oh you can make friends there. Well, then my aunt was like fuck you guys don't do that change schools, and then we'll school when I went to  That I actually liked and I had a chain that's a different story for later time metal leave that school for a different reason but it was yeah, I stayed in that Ike which problem might be you Carol. I mean you probably was honestly, but the next school was super cool because it wasn't my communist school where I went to a mess there. I went to a misstep protests. I went to like a colomba on that school. It was a lot of learning and I loved it. It was great. Like, excuse me.  Easy ninth grade trip to a since I mean sink there, huh? We love it. It was good. I didn't know where I was going. But then and the q1 was really good because I'm a was a lot of fun. You know, I would think that that would be him but not like it missed a I'd be like what am I doing here? Why don't you guys have houses that would really like know they know it was like what they do after they invade the lands. It was like a farm just the farm. Oh, yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. It's like  Negative I'd like because this what they do is they they get into like a big like usable like land for agriculture. That's not being used in any way and they invade it and after they are able to acquire that land through legal processes and we have that legislation that allows for that and result and then they divide the land into like little pieces in each little piece goes to a different family and they can like Farm on it and stuff. I think it's pretty  Cool still it's not very used, you know.  Yeah, but that's a very controversial thing Brazil. But that specific place that I went to the land had been acquired by a farmer like a big farmer fraudulently. So it was not his first place. So up for grabs are rather free go to the poor people just like this one is nice nice people.  Yeah, I like the Robin Hood type of thing would like which people's lands. Yeah. So yeah guys, I think this is a good place to end it with Communism.  If anyone's listening to this, I did not show any support you anything. No. No, it's just me talking guess. Yeah, we'll talk about more about fraudulent land acquiring and farms on our episode is coming out later this week breaking the format times 2. Yes. Mmm, what's gonna talk about the whole how do we say in the world situation that's happening right now.  schedule a shitstorm on fire  Exactly. Mmm. This girl is on fire. Did you see the video that deep fake video? They did they got Alicia Keys in the yeah, so it's not as face on her so much.  Anyway, I'll kill you first have a good Facebook group that we can like post that kind of stuff. It's like see all the means that we write. Will we ever have a Facebook group dog? Well, maybe when Facebook people get a little better.   Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, I'm afraid that if we have been dumpster fires. Yeah, every that if we do create a Facebook group, you just like implode in two months. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so maybe someday if you guys asked for it we'll do it, but that will be a tough screening process.  Number one question. Have you ever started a dumpster fire on purpose?  If so, leave the link so I can read up on it. Yeah. So yeah you guys I hope you guys continue to have a good end of the world because he has already started by Estelle. Ciao.

spotify:episode:3DoW4hv2EoMCzfuDkrqdDi	What's going on till my beautiful listeners on my podcast? So I have been using anchor for quite some time now and I have to say this is the best app. I decided to download it is free of use and it's very simple which I love. Okay. So if you're trying to open a podcast and you don't know where to start or how to start I highly recommend anchor okay, you can also make some side money on this as  They send you sponsorship and one not so I highly recommend this app. All right. Now you guys enjoy my podcast for the day have a good one. What's going on told my beautiful listeners on my podcast. I would like to make this episode dedicated to the ego because I just think a lot of people don't understand the eagle and what is all about? Okay, I think some people kind of get it but at the same time  You know, I guess because so many people's brain are using the left hemisphere is kind of like it can kind of like fog the broader perspective of of what the ego is all about. Now this three reality this this Matrix, you know right now every what we are experiencing right now. Okay, from what we came out of our mother's womb.  Umm to when we leave the physical. This is all ego base. Okay. So this entire room is revolving around ego. All right, we are in the 3D Matrix. We are in the third dimensional density. All right or fear. Okay. We are experiencing this 3D realm in the 3D sphere. All right.  so, you know when people in the spiritual Community or real individuals that are doing the spiritual work, you know, they're going to constantly talk about the ego because this is something we really have to become aware of on the 3D Matrix because if we don't become aware of our ego is going to consume us and we're going to start operating from it on a very very very very very extreme rate and that is  To call the false self. Okay, so when people operate from their ego on an extreme rate and their detached from who they truly are their authentic being, you know, they're not going to even recognize that they're operating from a false self. And this is why a lot of people have issues with projecting self-reflecting introspecting taking accountability things in that nature because they're operating from their false self and an  Same rate. They're very very very very detached from the true self. That is you know, the buried within your being. Okay, the body system is just the mobile. You are not the body you are the soul. The body is just something you're using until you leave when you leave your physical flesh. You're not taking your body with you. Okay, and this is the whole thing where reincarnation if people are not aware of themselves and people are just  Doing a lot of toxic shit to each other and and it's sad because there I don't think some people are even capable of acknowledging their own toxic traits because they're operating from the false self. So extremely that they think is normal they think is okay and they just start justifying those things. Like they don't know how to self-reflect. They don't know how to acknowledge like wow.  I've been doing this all my life, but I didn't realize how toxic it was to me or others. Some people don't know how to do that and it's a sad reality. But now the twist to this is that people think they know how to take accountability. They think they know who they truly are and they think they know like how to tune in keyword think and that's because many people are trapped in the mind. You know what I'm saying? They they  But everything that they are experiencing in the 3D realm there, they're stuck in the mind and they're not really truly embodying the things that they're thinking or saying out of their mouths. You understand what I'm saying? They're not embodying it and this is why so many people don't you know, they don't know how to back up their words what action it's a sad reality. All right, A lot of people are stuck in their head.  Ed and detach from the body, you know, they you know, they forgot to to I guess it's not that they've they have blockages from embodying the things that are coming out of their mouth. All right now like I mentioned the Eagles not gonna die if you want to kill the eagle, you have to kill yourself. There's no other way around it. Okay, but when spiritual people say, oh kill the ego they're just talking about become aware of the fucking shit. That's really what they're trying to say. Okay.  You know, if you kill the ego your you have to kill yourself because then that means you have to leave your body every matter on this physical is ego-based every materialistic thing. All right, even when we speak every time we express ourselves every time we think okay, all of that is Eagle base. You understand what I'm saying? Even when you take action all of that is ego-based, but of course  You know, some people have unwell a lot of people actually not some they have unhealthy Eagles. Okay, where's to extreme and they're stuck on their head and you know what I'm saying? They're in prison to their head and their detached from embodying whatever the hell they thinking or whatever the hell they're saying and these are people that are operating from their false self, you know, and it's a sad reality, you know, you know, you can when you speak to people you can see the  Ego versus the true self, you know, you can see the difference. You see what I'm saying? But at the same time when you have unhealthy ego you realize like okay, you know, it's still a part of me. So I'm going to have to utilize this in a proper manner. Where is not consuming me too much where I'm operating from a false self a false identity, you know, you know how many people are operating from a delusional?  No mindset, it's a lot and and you know, this is the 3D Matrix, you know, everything that is created here on this physical came from a thought. You see what I'm saying? So everything came out of nothing so all of the stuff that that we give matter to his only important because we created that reality and are self-conscious but there's no importance and the majority of the shit on the 3D Matrix not even your body. It's a reality, okay.  There is important from the ego the all these things are important from the eagle. So when you have a healthy ego you learn how to you know, do things that is good for your physical body. Go to the gym. He healthy, you know, all those things work out, you know, go ahead and on the physical, you know, do what you need to do.  Make your personal life better for your for yourself because we're all individuals. We are we all here for a different purpose. So what I'm here and the vision I have on this physical is different from one of the person because we all lived through different mental Dimension. And I think people forget that, you know, people are very one-track minded but you know, you just cannot escape the ego but at the same time you have to utilize it properly like I mentioned, you know what I'm saying?  You have to know because the ego is basically, you know, what you're going to what you're going to utilize the most on the 3D Matrix. Okay, because this is the realm of the ego but not the problem is a lot of people are too detached from their true self their true nature and they're operating from it on an extreme rate. And this is the cause of blockages. Okay, people also tend to be very very  You know, they told you one thing but then their action tells you another and that's because the false self is doing that you understand what I'm saying? But you cannot blame these people, you know, it's just the way the body system is like a machine and it's just the way these people are operating on the physical and how self-aware they are of their body which is like a computer system. How aware they are of it. Okay, you are the only one that could uh, you know, decode and recode and and reprogram yourself.  Subconscious nobody else can do that. But now if you live heavily from the false self then and you have no control of your power you understand what I'm saying the false self, which is the ego seeks external validation constantly seek external materialistic things, you know, like, oh, well, you know and this is the cause of rebounding I'll give you an example like, you know, let's say you're dumping your partner because their shitty person and then they don't want to take accountability or self reflect that there actually  Teddy person because they're operating from the ego the false self, you know, so they don't know how to Humble themselves to go within you know, and and do they know work right as above so below so below so above so what happens to these people is they because they're so delusional to their own shit right there living from the ego and an extreme rate, they run and and and try to find anybody that's going to give them any kind of attention just to seek the validation just to seek  the justification that they're not toxic that there are not the problem. You know what I'm saying? This is why a lot of people rebound because you know is usually toxic people that do a lot of rebounding so, you know, what happens to these type of entities is they don't they don't want to take accountability. They don't want to be like, wow. I'm really I'm a shitty person. You know, I just really do need to work on myself. They don't know how they don't want to do that. They're too weak. So instead. They're gonna go ahead jump into a new relationship and then they're going to  Feed their ego more through external validation and say well look this. I have a new partner and this person that called me toxic is still single, but I have a new partner and I'm in a new relationship. So obviously that person is the problem not me because look I'm in a relationship and is way better than that relationship. I was in and thought of and you know, that's what the ego does because they egos a trickster. It talks a lot in the mind.  It uses words all those words in your brain. That's not you you just a listener. You just observe her. Okay, and you know many people have different name for this, you know, and people, you know, religious people like to call it the that the devil demons, but it's not really the devil or demons. It's just people avoiding the Shadow Self. Okay, the more people avoid the Shadow Self  And the more they gonna keep living through external validation. And then this is these this is why individuals think that the devil's and external thing, you know. Oh, you know, why is this happening to me? Why is why is the devil attacking me, you know, these are individuals that live from the ego and an extreme rate you feel me? There's they're afraid of the dark. They're afraid of themselves. The dark is the true self, by the way, you know, and not every darkness is bad, you know.  No, you just have to learn how to balance the light and the dark because when you too extreme on the light, you can operate from the false self ego base. When you too extreme in the dark, you're going to consume that energy so much that you can become very self-destructive and very negative on the physical. Okay and very evil doing things doing evil things to people without you even realizing it. Okay, but if you're too extreme on either end, it can become evil.  Have to learn how to balance the yin and yang within the body system is state center. Okay, but you know, I just want to make this clear that you cannot kill the fuckin Eagle. Okay, it's just about becoming aware of it. Okay and and things in that nature, you know and about 95% of the time if we go up to people and we just give them are unwanted opinion of who they are, right?  You know a lot of people love doing this to other people, but what people that do this are constantly projecting and is sad because they don't realize it, you know, people that constantly have to give their unwanted opinion to other people without the other individual asking for in stuff like that. Usually that's that's most likely a projection. Okay, you know when somebody is at when somebody's ready to ask for your advice, they're going to ask you okay, but the you know a lot of us we just give our unwanted  Penny in and perceive it as an advice because the ego wants to justify what they're about to say and they're not realizing that they're projecting. They're not realizing that what they're saying to that individual is actually something that's relying in their own conscience and they're not aware of it because they don't know how to self-reflect and introspect, you know, if you ask me I think one of the biggest and the biggest key to existing here on this physical  Without becoming too extreme on either end. It's just fucking self reflecting and introspecting people just do not know how to do that. You know, people are just constantly distracting themselves running away from themselves. And you know, they're just living the fast life and you know what I'm saying, and and all of that stuff is like a it's like a drug to the ego, you know, because the ego definitely releases some type of  Endorphins in the brain when it is fed. Okay. So if it become a if it becomes a monster, you know individuals are going to do what they need to do to feed it. And unfortunately, you know, this is what happens to narcissist individuals there. There are slaves to their ego. Unfortunately, you know, they're stuck there.  You know what I'm saying? It's you know, this is the Matrix the body system is a computer and you know, some computers are fucked up. You feel me? Some computers have some deep viruses that I don't even think is possible for it to come out you feel me? But you know, I just wanted to make this clear because you feel me a lot of people think like, oh, you know, you know, you know, they go around talking about all you got ego you got ego  Everybody does even you telling that individual you got ego. That's your ego doing that. You know, everybody does the Eagles always going to exist and is heightened here because this is the this is the home of it. So it's very big here, but it's about  Making it healthier don't beat into it too much to the point. It becomes a monster. Okay, and then you can't control it in your in your in your being you understand what I'm saying? But who you truly are is very transparent. All right, you are a transparent Source. The soul has no gender. It has no no physical attachment anything but we are experiencing this.  Room right now. So your soul is trapped within your body. Okay, and eventually  as time progressed and and and we and we leave this physical then you your your soul is going to free yourself out of the body. Okay, but at the same time they call this the Saturn moon Matrix, so they using Carmen us a lot here a lot of car Manos. Okay. So if you going a lot of things that are perceived as normal, you know from The Matrix is actually not normal and you know  It can cause more karmic depth in your being but that's what the elites want because they want you to come back. They want you to come back right over here so you can keep being a slave to them. So that's why they're going to you know, set the system up to the point where you're going to come back regardless, you know.  You know, but I think there's a possibility that people can actually transcend out of the 3D. Once they leave and not come back, you know, definitely you definitely have to have a good heart. You definitely cannot be using people and taking advantage of people and distracting yourself and feeding your ego, you know, and and thinking you're better than people and cheating on people and sneak being sneaky and this  Leaving people and a lot of things there's a lot of things that people are doing and the sad reality is they're not even they can't even be there not even able to acknowledge these things. They're not even able to say wow.  I didn't realize this toxic trait was in me because the eagle is Big here. People don't know how to take accountability. Okay, so I felt like ranting about them, you know, because I just feel like people confuse the whole ego thing big time.  Big time. So yeah, that was it. You guys have a good one.	But now if you live heavily from the false self then and you have no control of your power you understand what I'm saying the false self, which is the ego seeks external validation constantly seek external materialistic things, you know, like, oh, well, you know and this is the cause of rebounding I'll give you an example like, you know, let's say you're dumping your partner because their shitty person and then they don't want to take accountability or self reflect that there actually Teddy person because they're operating from the ego the false self, you know, so they don't know how to Humble themselves to go within you know, and and do they know work right as above so below so below so above so what happens to these people is they because they're so delusional to their own shit right there living from the ego and an extreme rate, they run and and and try to find anybody that's going to give them any kind of attention just to seek the validation just to seek the justification that they're not toxic that there are not the problem.  And you know, they're just living the fast life and you know what I'm saying, and and all of that stuff is like a it's like a drug to the ego, you know, because the ego definitely releases some type of Endorphins in the brain when it is fed.

And today we're going to continue our fourth part of week two and four new words are words for today. Are incomprehensible manipulate maximum and mimic. Let's start with the first word incomprehensible. It is a little bit big but we're going to spell It Anyway Inc. Om p r e h-- e NS ible incomprehensible incomprehensible is a very simple adjectives which means impossible to understand.  For example, our schools intercom system is so old that this morning's announcements were almost incomprehensible or impossible to understand and synonyms for impossible are the words baffling confusing and bewildering and antonyms for in comprehensible are the words understandable clear plain and intelligible. So that was incomprehensible our first word. How about the second?  Manipulate manipulate is spelled maaaaan. I pu late-2008 and it's a verb which means to handle or use skillfully to manage or control for personal gain or Advantage. For example, we say scientists should not manipulate data scientists should not manage or control the data for personal gain or Advantage. They should be  Active and synonyms for manipulate are the words work maneuver exploit and influence. So that was manipulate our second word. Our third word maximum is spelled m ax I am um, and it's a noun that means the greatest possible amount or degree and it can also be used as an adjective which means reaching the greatest possible amount or degree. For example, this postage scale.  Can weigh a maximum of only five pounds or we can say to ease the patient suffering the doctor prescribed the maximum dosage of painkillers when synonyms for maximum are the words largest highest or at most and antonyms are the words least lowest minimum or smallest. So that was maximum and how about our fourth and last word for today? Mimic mimic is  expelled mi mi see a mimic can be a noun and that means a person who does imitations or it can be a verb and it means to imitate or to make fun of for example, we say the comedy troupe has many talented members, but it's still needs to hire a good mimic a person who does imitations and we can say Troy continually entertains his friends because he can mimic any accent. He hears and  Means he can imitate synonyms for mimic as a noun are the words copycat and impersonator and as a verb are the words parrot and impersonate. So these were our four words for today incomprehensible manipulate maximum and mimic. I hope you liked our words for today and don't forget join me tomorrow for the last four words of week 2 and then we will have our interactive activities that will help us remember  For these 20 words, we will have finished by the end of this week and we will retain them for a long time and add them to our active vocabulary Bank.

I just like our lawyer above that. Are you above that turning in a resume for? No, it's just that like I just got like, you know, when I was younger I didn't have to turn a resume. They just told me to fill out an application and come in and do an interview and you're good to go for like, you know, it's got to structure for my liking and just like that's life in the valley dude. You gotta have a master's to work in a coffee shop.  Now in the valley, that's what it seems like so I just kind of like put that on the side just kind of like enjoy my weekends now, but I want to find a sidekick Oh, I thought it's pretty funny. When I saw that you were DJ and I was like, what is this dude doing is you get like invited to every wedding what's going on here? Oh, yeah, it's dude. I couldn't believe that you texted me asking if I get paid for that or if I just go for fun. I don't know. Yeah. Yeah, I get paid great company gonna gonna do a little shame.  This plug actually we don't have any sponsors. They're not paying me for saying this is obviously but Sound by Design great company if you want us to DJ your weddings, we do an incredible job, especially in the greater Milwaukee area.

So Sound by Design look us up on Google Facebook Instagram Twitter the likes go ahead and  Give us a shout out if you're getting married and need a DJ.  Did you have to do training until I get like taught how to DJ or  Yeah, there was a training there was some training involved. But basically you start off as an assistant. You just kind of helped bring everything in and then after a little bit.  Once you know enough they'll let you become like a lead DJ. Nice. Nice. Yeah, dude. So earlier this week when I texted you, right, you know last week we talked about how adulthood is all like  Like, you know this and that and what not just like it's not out. That's not what it is. You know, you expect it to be or what you said you wanted to be if I may say, I don't know where I'm going with this but earlier this week one of my co-workers, he's Russian and he's been in the US and he's like did Hollywood really screwed me over because you know, he will have to stay in the way they were.  So many people put of All Peoples around. Yes. He got stuck in a hole, you know in your adulthood partying and doing crazy stuff and you're gonna have like friends and all that all that good stuff that Hollywood portrays of like a great life and then he's like man Hollywood really screwed my life and he's like 31 and he's like one of the smartest engineers and our floor and I just thought how like funny is that he said that because like yeah like some  Some aspect of like Hollywood is like pretty fun to watch and like, you know makes you you know, wish you had a life like that but I never thought someone would take it that literal, you know like to some extent like I took friends like the TV show a little bit like serious. They're like, yeah, I got my I think that's fair. Yeah. I thought my  20s our early 20s would be like that but obviously it's not like that, you know, just like where are you where there's three guys and three girls that are just are somehow best friends and all hook up with each other. And yeah, there's they reserve it in the matter of 27 minutes. Yeah, we've resolved it. I said reserve it. Oh my God. All right, and I just thought it was like just kind of fun.  Because like the bra a little bit nostalgic to me when I when I when he said that to me because I'm just like there are a lot of things when I was like young and I was just thinking about like once I get to College. I'm going to live this lifestyle once again, you know a job of a live this lifestyle and it's like damn that was not how I portrayed this like whole story to be like not saying that like, my life sucks right now whatnot. But like to some extent there are a lot of things. I watched on TV that I thought would come to fruition like what  Got to that point and then here a 31 year old talk about how Hollywood scooters life just kind of like well, what are some things that I miss from back then or whatnot, you know? Yeah. Absolutely. Do you have any examples of those things that you can think of off the top of your head? Yeah. I mean it's ships is it you know, what you would be spending your free time doing. What is that? What are you kind of going on there?  So, you know, I was thinking like this is like on Friday. I was with the girls and friends and I just didn't go out and then I always think about how like in grade school and high school. The one thing that you look forward to every dance party was like a good torque dance.  Yeah, I know. I know what it was, but I just like no one goes to party and just says you're saying you were looking back like you were watching like and young adult films that came out weird not young adult films films and TV shows that portrayed Yadkinville, but what I'm saying is you had seen them.  Partying and every single party there was just Molly being tossed around and you know you like somebody was getting too worked on dead at some point and you just assume man. That's College. That's what it's actually like Asher Roth was no it before then like like high school like dance just like prom whatnot. I went to Catholic school and it was so funny because I remember  R1 dance where they like band torque and right. So this is where this is where like you knew you had to decide this is where you knew you had boys. It was like one of our Dean's will look like ogre right would always be looking in to like the dance floor and making sure everybody's being a poet. He look like Shrek Shrek he did he would look into like the look into like that for make sure everybody was good and then like everyone would be in a circle just like with their hands out.  Covering just that one person who's gonna twerk dance and then they'll let that happen to the next song someone else and you put your hands up and I just thought that was so funny to me that we actually did some stupid stuff like that. You went to the you went to the wildest. I'm school that I've ever heard. It's a goblet. What is insane Catholic school? And then that does like to behavior and I was like like, you know, just like dancing with someone casually, like now it's like awkward even go up to someone and be like, hey, what's up?  How are you doing or like even try to block you want to dance but they're back then it was like, you know, you guys are dancing while just having a great time, you know, and now it's like yeah, I know I know. Oh that person's that person standing on the Dance Floor. How how we are they? I don't know man. Like I don't know why but like that. I just thought about it. I was like, that's the one thing I just could recall that was like part of probably like the funniest and like  Some some somewhat like a thrill to know that you're going to experience that going to a dance party. Hey, you know, what's also another weird thing is this like me and my friends we would go to these teen parties, right? And my mom was never before so go to these teen parties the same atmosphere yet. I mean same atmosphere, but no, what do you mean teen parties? Like they're like people and like like  What was like between highs games like high school parties, but not like your friends hosted in my the house, but like actual like promoters that created like a party. I was only four teenagers like oh, yes, we had this thing called night storm. It was the same thing called Purple Haze as Dallas. Yeah, you look who's at some random. Yeah. Yeah. They try to make it.  Try to try to like create to get young adult there. Yeah, it's pretty much like until you were 19.   I can't tell you how many of those I went to her. Like I would go to that with my friends and my mom I'd like to my mom and be like, hey, I'm like doing some sort of like sporting event with my buddies and I'm staying at their house this night and then it would be a Saturday night will go to the stuff. Right and I go and it would get back on. Our friends parents will bring us back home like around like 2 or 3 a.m. But then I'd wake up at like six o'clock to make sure I got home so I can go to church with my mom so that she doesn't get mad with  That's like every Saturday I would do this and it's like oh my God, this is like just kind of like I got little bit.  I don't know I got I thought that was pretty free cool times or whatnot and then last night I watch The Cosby Show which even brought more more nostalgic people like that's an use. Yeah, but that also like Kozlov like a social ban on that show man. I think you're supposed to stop watching it all anymore.  I just like I remember watching for when I was younger and it was just there and I was like, I don't remember this. Obviously, there's like some controversial things going on right now with you know, Bill Cosby or whatnot, but also like what's not  There are some controversial things that are going on. I think we can yeah, we know what those controversial things are many it's already out there. But oh, I'm just trying to say that was like watching it to praise him. But I was just watching it to be like I used to watch the show. Yeah, it was on it because it was on watch the show for the folks that that haven't caught on. Our topic of this week is nostalgia.  That's kind of what we wanted to talk about. But I'll stop interrupting, you know, any go ahead and continue now. I understand why you were watching it. I was sure of his actions at all. It was just a it was just you know, I was just like, you know, watch it like man.  I used to watch that everybody Jake what some things you miss from childhood?  So I was thinking about this for a while. I kind of had me had me thinking I had to take some time out today.  but one of the big things for me when I started Boy Scouts  There were a lot of camping trips that we went on. So this was this was Middle School. This is 6th grade middle school.  And I joined this this troop and it wasn't.  The most in line with like the boy scout values, I guess it was pretty much just a bunch of people who wanted to go camping on the weekends and do cool shit, but we had to kick it.  Scout like related so each month, there will be a new camping trip.  And it would be revolved around a merit badge. So for instance, there was a biking merit badge you had to do 50 miles a 50 mile bike ride. So our dads just said well, why don't we just like 50 miles out. We all meet at a point two dads can drive their trucks to meet us at the Meetup point at a campsite 50 miles away. We find a bike trail that will take us 50 miles to that destination and then we just can't there that night.  There's a rock climbing merit badge. So we went to Devil's Lake which is a has a ton of limestone and whatnot. So we learned how to rock climb on these legitimate Limestone rock formations basically as opposed to just going to an indoor facility.  There was a lot of that stuff white water rafting we did there was a canoeing trip. There's like a canoeing merit badge. We're supposed to just do a certain mileage of canoeing I believe and so we got dropped off upriver canoe down like five miles or something to an island down this River stayed on the island for the night had a massive fire made our food and whatnot and then canoed another.  Three miles the next day where we were picked up. It was pretty incredible. And I just remember that being such a cool experience because I've never really gone like roughing it camping. There's always a structure that we stayed in and we were all just kind of like thrown into these situations. Whereas like no like set up your tent make your own food like your own fire.  And I mean as an eleven-year-old that's that was kind of an interesting experience. But I just remember being on those trips and like sleeping under the under the stars just an incredible time and it just presented some Solace and you know in an in our life, I think, you know, we can we can kind of get back to what people are doing in our age and I mean, there's a lot of partying and whatnot.  and at that age, I think we were definitely idolizing the whole party scene as well, but you can I guess  Relate everything to some sort of escapism, you know people party just to let go just to release have a good time kind of forget whatever is going on and just spend time with their friends and and you know, just hit let inhibitions lower I guess.  But as I was writing this down and thinking about that, I definitely had that same feeling, you know, when you just go camping, you know, you you get done with a 50-mile bike ride. That's like not even paved roads or anything like a paved route you get done with that and you can't at the end of it. There's this experience that you hold with the people that have that have  Also done it and you just have this sense of accomplishment like a sense of bliss sleeping under the stars with a fire is always just a comfortable experience and you just you just sleep. Well, you know, and it's definitely an escapism. It's like, all right. Well, I have class in obviously class in middle school was horrible, but you can just remember. Okay well  Next weekend. I'm going on this camping trip, and we're going to go whitewater rafting and I'm pretty pumped to just do something that's completely outside of  So that was a big memory of me and looking at some pictures when I was doing that. I've sold some old camping trip memories. Yeah, it's a good time. It's like thinking about it. It's like it's really like I just I got a lot of trouble.  But it was like I was always up to something, you know, and I know it's like I had a lot of fun when I was younger.  They say scheming. Yeah. Yeah, man, I was always up to something and like my mom can trust me to go camping and like do something. So like always played Sports to keep me busy. So I didn't like doing thing like as I start playing more Sports. I kept I started doing less stupid things. But before I was playing sports, I was like always up to something bad like like everything was just  But yeah, I mean that's the one thing I actually didn't really do a lot when I was young Grouse go camping. But then again that could be a stereotype thing in the woods Bears. Yeah. I don't know if I would have wanted to do that little butt.  How's that a stereotype thing Hollywood movie of some black person in the Middle Woods ends up being a black person dying first. So there's like this fear of being a middle of the Woods.  Okay, what did what did we learn about Hollywood in the beginning of this podcast? Yeah, there's that but like  yeah, I don't know you're still a fear going into the woods. I think it's every horror movie which is which is quite unfortunate.  But you know, thank God for movies like get out.  Just Paving the way for four solid horror flicks big fan of that. What's really good like?  Movie that's like not your typical Hollywood movie where like it?  It's like lies about how life should be or how like this.  The most truthful truthful movie you've ever watched would you think of this?  hmm  I mean, I'd like one of my one of my favorite movies is about time. That's one of my favorite movies. I'd say it is my favorite movie and there are definitely some Hollywood Parts. They're just like, all right, man. That was a that was a Hollywood thing, but it's definitely a pretty good feel good movie on an aspect of your life that you don't really think about until  Kind of one scene towards the end first time watching this movie is is incredible. I highly highly recommend it. It doesn't have that great of reviews everybody that I've watched it with and I've talked to about it.  They love it. They love the movie and it really just gives you an aspect of this life that you live and haven't really thought about but once the film brings light to it you kind of realize  Wow. All right. Yeah that makes sense. It's not like any particular life lesson it more just helps you realize.  Something that you probably take for granted in your life. I'd say yeah, I have actually never watched that movie before but like well, you should do that because I think it's on Netflix now finally. Okay. Yes. You should definitely want that shambles right now actually on Netflix right now as we speak, but apparently like I was watching before I called you.  I'm not going to say the name of it because I get judged by it. But come on man. Hey Tony, what I was gonna say. Is that like are you not you should tell me what that is. Actually, I'm not get charged. I can't get a good job, but it's called someone great. It's on Netflix. But what I bought I was trying to say is like from  When my co-workers like his situation, I'm curious like how people's life force actually or how many people think that their life like is messed up because of what they watch and believe them.  What do you told me that I just couldn't stop laughing and he got offended but he was actually being so serious. I just didn't think that people really took it to that extent of like  actually believe in their life's going to be like this and I think some people actually like live a life, but that's because you're using your parents money, but the average person like cannot live a Hollywood, you know inspired lifestyle. This is so it's got to be really sad if people are actually aspire to live like that right now or hoping that that's where they have most gonna come from.  They really kind of makes me think because you know a lot of shows are.  they just always have a happy ending, you know, we always expect a happy ending just like all right, this is gonna this is gonna work out seamless, so I don't need to worry about seamless and I really think people people have  Somewhat believe that where it's like, okay, I don't have to I don't have to deal with this right now. Like it's gonna work out or something's going to happen. And I think people really have a hard time.  Including myself, like definitely myself grasping the idea that okay. Yeah, this is going to work out but it's only going to work out if I put forth effort to make it work.  It's not just going to be you know, do what's comfortable and just assume it's going to work itself out some of these issues. It's it's definitely more. So the realization that you know you have in your life.  These these skills and these capabilities to kind of just grab Yourself by the haunches and in and change these aspects but I think people really just kind of forget about so let's let's get back into friends, right? Let's get back into friends. Yeah, Rachel Rachel and Ross broke up. Yeah. Okay. Thank you.  but there took a point where they had to talk about it like they  I really am having a hard time completely remembering but I think Rachel was just not I totally uninterested in hearing about what happened. But if you also remember Ross was kind of grasping with the grappling with the idea of do I tell her and right away it was like, yeah, I tell her I really don't think people actually make those decisions right away. They they do make the decisions for instant Comfort where it's like I'm not  To tell her or you try to defend yourself and in certain ways, but then even when that does happen, I think what Hollywood really?  Downplays is the fact that it is a super super stressful time and it doesn't go away after 30 minutes of an episode like most people assume like okay. This is going to be resolved at the end of the episode. I just have to get through that and it's fine, but I don't think people realize is how long that takes like it takes it takes time and it takes  Continuous like focus on whatever you're doing. So if you get into an argument like that, I think it real life it would last.  Days if not weeks.  You know some type of argument we've had four for the other person to actually be like, okay, this is this is how I feel about it and to completely gathered all their thoughts. But until then it's pretty messy. It's not just messy for five minutes and then they resolve it and then it's good. So I think that's probably where  The biggest thing that I guess I've found there's a new show on Netflix that's called friends from college. It's like our generation of friends and it is pretty much a bunch of friends who went to the same College together and they just pretty much like screwing each other just like the other friends but this one's like even more raunchy like like they're really like our generation type of  friends and how  they would how would we how we would interact with friends and it's quite scary because then it's like it goes to another topic of like what is like marriage going to look like within our generation which doesn't seem like a lot of people are for the whole title. I want to be married and whatnot. But like I mean, there's some great tax benefits, but also like some people like, you know,  aren't really whole like I'm really for the whole monogamy lifestyle, especially with like  going after going to college and no one that you can like literally be with the whole world and whatnot and just like move on here and there and there and I'm not speaking for myself new scene in general like our generation generally more what you're saying is just like serial monogamy. Yeah, but you mean you have like one person for six to six months to however many years and then you kind of grow apart a little bit. Yeah. Yeah as opposed to just like baby baby, baby.  Yeah.  I don't know. I mean that that shows.  Pretty good. I mean I just finished watching it a nice texture one of my friends. I was like, this is totally your lifestyle right there. Like this is you and that girl and he has some cheat on each other and deal with this and that and he's like probably has like a can't we just laughed at it? But but yeah Hollywood Hollywood and him if you listen to his podcast stop daydreaming about what your life.  could be and just  probably daydream about what your life was like before and just get that installed sick feeling and be happy for that.  Jake what do you got? I think so too. I kind of just want to add on that when I was thinking about this, you know, we always you know, you hear motivational speakers talk about don't dwell on the past something like that or people generally think about the past is negative. They they can only remember negative things because I mean- things strike more emotion. So this is this is hard to find. You know, what what specific moments in my life made me genuinely happy.  It was like well, I remember that moment. But that was not a good one. That was a negative. Yeah, and just so on and I think probably you know, it's very easy to go and think of the past, you know, you just sit in bed at night and it's like oh, yeah. I remember that thing that I did when I was in third grade. That was just really dumb. Yeah. What was I thinking it is just as well on that for the next like 10 minutes. Yeah.  I think it's really easy to get into that. So I mean maybe maybe the next time you think of something that's negative that you did in the past try and think of something really really positive that you remember in that in as close of a time period to then and maybe maybe you won't look so negatively on the past. I don't know. I'm gonna try that out. Yeah.  Not take Hollywood movies are shows to Sears. Even though it does make me like laughing like happy in the moment of like what could be but like yeah dick excited for Game of Thrones last episode today.  Yeah, I'm very excited very very excited for the show to be done and then I can stop being so disappointed. So I feel ya are you not happy with last week? So it was I mean it was probably it was one of the better episodes because I really didn't see.  I'm not I don't want to be a spoiler show. So I didn't really see that big thing that everybody who has seen the show knows what I'm talking about where someone does is they weren't supposed to and other things happen. Basically, basically though we did not see that this I didn't think it was gonna be that  probably sounds so weird to people who don't know what I'm talking about. But other than that man the writing assistant asked it's been absolutely all right podcast. We're going over time a little bit. Thanks for tuning in tune in next week. Have a good one.	Hollywood ruining lives and the past is beautiful to think about sometimes!
spotify:episode:4G5GXC9eZAKiEPerHn2pTJ	 Hey, hey, hey, thank you for tuning into perspective and Razzle and the founder and host I've perspective if this is your first time welcome.  I am happy to know that you are here with me and I am not alone. This is the second episode.  If you haven't heard the first no need to stop listening now, there's no particular sequence as to get this work. You can continue on listening here and when we're done you can check the first episode out.  Thank you to all of the listeners who tuned in on my very first.  Attempt at reaching the masses sharing some perspectives point of views and site a back during the first episode.  You guys totally whacked more than I could have ever imagined all the repost and comments Tax phone calls emails.  Super super appreciative. So again, thank you. Thank you for that. Thank you in advance. I look forward to keeping you all to in during our first episode. We talked about taking a chance of getting out of our own way. Just doing that thing that we've been thinking about considering dreaming of our lease initiating the process.  says to getting to that place and   almost everyone is familiar or has reported to me that they could totally relate to it and just overall that's the kind of  impact that I hope to have while talking aloud and sharing, you know.  My Views and perspectives not to sound too Shay, you know on things that somewhere somehow and you know, I'll process we've  Cross these these issues are there they've come across and sometimes they're easy to deal with and sometimes not so much.  I think going into this episode something that is equally as important equally as important as you know, tapping into your purpose and try to figure things out or you know, doing something that scares you I think before you can get to that place being  Yourself and being comfortable with yourself. I think it's one of the first steps to facilitating any of those previous things.  Or are chip just starting starting a new beginning when you embrace the skin that you're angry you embrace yourself when you embrace your discomforts when you embrace you.  It makes it very hard for people to come to you with their opinions their ideas. What they were thinking that would be best for you self comfortability. Like what is that to me? That's an array of things. That is knowing.  How strong you are knowing how sensitive you are knowing how?  Cool, you are even when nobody else thinks that about you knowing how unique you are what that means. You know being unique is one of those things that they teach you about when you're young when you're a kid, you know, that's a unique name.  you know, they usually relate unique to the word weird like a nice way that people were taught to sometimes identify with things that are weird and we think of weird we think of things that are different but unique is just that it's an attribute, you know to a person a place a thing that helps Define who they are and when you are comfortable with your uniqueness, baby,  that's a beautiful thing when you're comfortable with your Louis when you're comfortable with your  discomfort knowing that it exists and yeah, I don't like that being able to express that articulate that say that right that show that again like I personally think that you should personally think that those are things that you should embrace being  Okay with your shortcomings your looks your weight self-esteem.  Your status all those things that we think are so so so significant in our makeup, you know doing things at your own pace staying in or creating your only the people that are most comfortable with themselves like they are at their at peace with themselves. And when when they say that they don't care what other people think.  Be they truly mean that.  This is something that does not always just happen overnight. Like you will probably listen to this and tomorrow you will just you won't just feel yes yesterday. I wasn't comfortable with myself. But right now today I and it's a process. It's something like anything. It's it's good and it's worth it. It's something that has to be worked on.  But it is very possible. You take small steps, you know, I think initially something very very important is to change your mindset change how you think about things change how you feel about things change how you process things change how you react to things when we can  You know.  Be slow to take and quick to give because we're comfortable with knowing whatever happens. You're not losing anything. You know what we can say what Lisa, it's me. Oh, I'm blanking on I'm going 7:30 when we can stop doing that and you know stare at a person sit back and think like Mmm Yeah.  Wow, you said that okay. I'm cool with no one else that you think and I'm okay with know what I think about myself and I'm not going to give you that to me that's part of the Journey of being comfortable with yourself knowing that you don't have to show up to every finger invited to whether that be in the literal sense or figuratively you all got to argue about things.  Maybe like you once did because you comfortable how you really feel and what you really think about whatever issue might be at hand whether that means literal. Yeah. I really don't want to be around those people. So I'll sit this one out. It's okay to miss something being comfortable with knowing that you would rather stay home with your dusty headscarf on didn't wash your ass for maybe 15 16 hours knowing that you will get  Wait, just not right now because you are comfortable low thing around that is okay. Your peers are going to call you and tell you you're a buster if they're going to tell you that you missed it and you needed to be here and you're going to say to yourself now is good where I was at is exactly where I needed to be why because when you practice being comfortable with who you are  It really is like a game-changer like imagine like imagine. We live on a planet where there's millions of people and some people believe it or not. We're rather emulate somebody else like for what?  I'm saying this stuff out loud, but we really really like thinking about it. Like why exactly what I want to be.  Come on that what exactly do I gain live at? Well, let's see first I have to put myself aside to now recreate what I think someone else has or is doing that takes time and that takes effort. Would you really not want to be the person who you are? Which means you don't have to think about what you're doing because naturally when you're yourself you just do you  You would put that aside to move how somebody else is moving. I personally wouldn't.  Now I'm not doing that. I think today we have social media and the images that are displayed in front of us all of us. It's like this perfect kind of thing this perfect place.  Everyone has these perfect looks and these perfect.  Teeth these perfect dress these perfect every single thing check this out. I I have almost next to no breast and I am so comfortable with knowing that that part of me exist and when you see me, you see that it exists to but because I already know is there and I've already embraced it. You really can't make me feel bad about it.  You know what? I mean? Like imagine how many times in my life I've been.  You know encountered with comments about these these little brush that I have not to mention one is one is smaller than the other like most people are so they told me but my name is minor noticeable, but I'm not dying over here. I know. Dr. Miami is this I know that if that's something that I'm losing sleep at night over exactly where I could go what I could do, but I'm cool. I'm cool with that.  I'm cool with this Lulu big city little city, that's part of me. So I'm okay, you know people have all their perfect possessions and they're perfect what I bought and they're sold not perfect. So will we see the fly exterior? Sometimes they're homeless or days women are really really sexy.  But he called himself public figures but they're hungry like you got to figure out like what you really really comfortable with. So if you comfortable with being fly but being broke, that's what you're going to do this message, then you will not receive because you're going to say that I don't know what I'm talking about and there's nothing like living the kind of life that you live. But when you're alone and nobody's there and your peers with the prized possessions, they  not pulling up next to you because there's our borrow to you know, what that feels like, you know, you're saying to yourself why exactly am I doing this what exactly am I what I what am I gaining?  You know, we do things we're gonna barf friends cause she gonna bawl her friend close. He going to come pick you up in a bar called why you got on the borrowed clothes with the ball bag and that's really not who you are. Like you're right. Now you don't have it. You don't have it and when you get it and you want to go by it like ye be talking about that's what you're going to do until you realize that's just that was ways.  And you know, we got to experience that but learning how to be comfortable what you have at the time when you have it and when your time is coming and it shows up and your glow up comes with that. It was Allah is part of the process. So being true to yourself and you know exuded the you and yourself. Yeah, you want to get so much further in life.  It's probably not going to see that way. If you're scrolling on a gram or any social media website looking for you know for for whatever you think is better than what you what you have or feeling like you're inadequate because you don't have those things like you what you have probably is more true than what you think these people appear to be but they but they spoil him.  You have to look into yourself and like yeah, I took it by myself.  I'm very useful. I'm very goofy.  I adore my family and friends, but sometimes I'm alone awake sometimes I want to be dolo. I want to eat by myself. I want to sleep alone. I love to shop alone. I sometimes you gotta get one with yourself treat your own self, you know show up for yourself.  flatter yourself  Will you have the ability to do those things for yourself looking for other people to do it for you or having expectations that you're not good enough because it's not being done for you. Sometimes you have to take yourself out. Sometimes you got to sit back with yourself and check you out walk past the mirror like, okay.  I see you but you exist you while you the person the individual you can be a statement. You can be a movement. It's nice when you have people that show up with you and you know company is cool, but you got to know that.  You can be real for yourself, especially before you fake Jacks for other people. Like what I got is what you're going to get you're going to get me.  Mia who looks Dusty most of the time  but my teeth are always clean and my face is always washed.  That's who I am. I accept that being of myself. You have to learn to be self-confident, you know that will usually help or boost how you feel about yourself at all times that doesn't entail being cocky or necessarily shitting on people but thinking highly of yourself, like I said changing how you feel about you. Well normally  You know God people how with how excuse me but how they feel about you having a dress you what have you they take in you know, I don't think there's a fine line between being yourself and being cocky. Oh, I think there's a very thick line. I think it's you know, it's it's almost like two different sides of the spectrum because when you are into yourself, it's not a public service announcement. It's just you are.  That's the answer yourself again. I don't Manatee and look at me. Look at me. It's more. So even if you don't look at me, like I still feel this way about myself. So what difference to me if you got glasses on and your faces turn the other way. I just may very well not stand in front of you. You don't even have to see me but none of that matters when I'm comfortable with me. I know I exist straight up like I need for these listeners that  Apps me feel like that may feel like they're struggling with being this when in front of these people and another way in front of these other people don't get me wrong not everybody's going to get the same you and not because that's not who you are. But I mean when I can see you  You know, I can like a totally different individual or I've known you for a long time and I've never seen these appearances come out of you and bang, you know, maybe somebody who you might think. It's somebody you start morphing. I would be taking the back. You know, I'm not going to put you on blast but I'm definitely a little date of item and I'm going to store that shit like yeah.  A little awkward I may or may not even call you out on it. But when I see it happen again, and again, it's definitely like, okay. We have a situation here.  Yeah, I like you. You may have seen that with your friends sometimes even with your family. He's alter egos or personalities come out of them, you know performing and putting on shows because maybe they think who they are is not good enough now, they like everybody's dysfunctional family. Yeah, because everybody got a portion attacked within that's part of why your family is your family.  And why some people rather be at your house for Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner or whatever holiday you celebrate versus they own cuz they get a glimpse of that realness. Sometimes it's a little unhealthy, but it is very real and I rather know that I don't gotta sit with my legs crossed and make sure no elbows on the table and I don't have to do all of that like you pull up on me and my family  Are we bugging out? Well, I was in the morning because that's where you know, and when you come in the presence of us, that's what you're going to get. You're not going to get a take it one on one just because for us that's us being who we are and I and I encourage that I encourage you to express your  disdain for things that don't make you happy  Or that you just you're not okay with because rather than pretend like you can you shed your might bring some light to a situation like your word man? Cuz I really want to go either thank God you said that because I was hoping that I was not trying to go up in there and be like this. You never know. Your honesty can break the ice on a situation where perhaps the person that you  With our next to they thought that they had the fake Jack. I've been in places that I've been around people quote unquote trying to impress me.  But such a turn-off like please don't spend your time trying to do nothing impressive for me or having conversations using jargon that I really don't want to go digging down into sat study guides 101 to figure out what it means. We don't have to do that. If you say something mean I don't know what you're talking about. That is exactly what I'm going to say to you.  Not worrying about what you're going to think when I tell you I don't know what that means. That is me being comfortable with myself if you're going to invite me to somewhere and show me a menu with things that I'm unfamiliar with.  I am not going to twist up my face, but I am going to inquire or I just may very well Google it while I'm next to you because I don't know that is part of me being comfortable with myself. You just gotta know that.  Be authentic you is probably what people really like about you. So when you show somebody something about yourself that's not real and then you are you know, the real you is being displayed is conflicting and then people start processing like so we when you was so so now so which one is you are which one?  One is your video.  My eyes are darting back and forth right now. You guys can't even see me because this thing these kind of things happen on a regular basis.  We have to continue to do things present day with in our lives that we are comfortable with.  I'm not sure how many of us are comfortable with being uncomfortable performing or faking jacks.  For other people, you know, sometimes we have to focus on ourselves.  And and that will help us, you know provide a feeling of comfort that you don't have to spend time searching for outside of yourself. So if you look within you what you get on the exterior is secondary because you're full and your hole.  Before you step out, you know, it's like going out and needing drinks to be to have a good time or to be feeling like you, you know, you living right? I'm gonna go out and you might be looking at me like she's got to be thirsty and I just might be like I drink anything tonight and I'm having a really really really good time and I'll be okay with that.  And I and I want you to know that I'm I'm sincerely.  Embracing Myself by doing exactly what it is. I really want to do rather than doing what looks cool doing what the masses are participating in we gotta Embrace who we are. Like I said Embrace What Makes You Different and or unique  people around you Dad may make you feel like you're unique your uniqueness or your quirkiness on your witness, whatever were they want to subject you to and you know, they put you down about it make you feel a kind of way you you have to put a stop to that you have to say uh-oh or please stop.  You know people who make you feel down for being who you really are, they need to be identified and need to be called out because most times that's probably just a defense mechanism for them. Yeah. Let me laugh at her hahaha me why they suffer is from surreal silence shit and he can't talk about it. So they're going to use you as a scapegoat to make you feel uncomfortable so they could boast, you know boost.  Ourselves and both about shit about themselves. That's really not going to talk about. Like I said be alone do things with yourself. I think that's a really good way to learn how to be comfortable.  With oneself is being by themselves, you know, sometimes we get jammed up into the relationships friendships.  Situation ships because we over here. Like I said, fine not being true to who we are and for life to be seen in despair because yeah, I thought that you know, I did that there really accept me ma'am. I gotta accept you for being who you are more than anybody else that you could ever imagine being and you know when the car  a close and the lights are dim and  people could sit back and like yo, damn she official. Can he do we help me down Dan what I'm going to be called a person those people that they'd be frightened to and be performing for and I can like they cool with but they really not they'll never make those comments about those care about those cats just because they can't cuz you you not be a real with yourself. So you can't think that you can feel those kind of weighs about people.  You know don't want that typically know who you are. So your homegirl your childhood friend that nobody sees, you know, your diary that you keep away from your mix. Yeah, like you hold up to a different standard, but imagine if you had everybody said I standard how smooth life would be for you because you didn't have to pretend like I encourage you all to spend time with yourself and  and essentially do what you can for yourself straight up go walking in the mall.  Make some music in the studio take your journal in the bathroom. Take a hot shower and light a candle do something that will help you appreciate who you are change how you think stop being so negative. Stop thinking that things are impossible, you know be you being alone being itself allows you to  Like I said value the authentic.  person inside of you and  you don't have to dumb that down for other people.  Take that advice for me know that when you see me, I am going to be me. I am not.  Walking around with my pinky in the air looking like Sunday's best dress 96% of the time. All right, maybe 86 percent of the time because I'm comfortable. I'm comfortable with myself. It's important to encourage you to do the same. Maybe no one delivers this kind of message. Maybe no one says  You look beautiful that way.  I like your beard when it's a little scruffy your tuck the your Chuck teases dog, but they cultured like you got to feel you before somebody else could feel you and if you lack that for yourself building grow it the things that I mentioned that I suggested, you know that you could do go to the movies for though logo to eat.  Go to Starbucks.  Go to the park and sit on the bench and watch the birds.  Figure is he figuratively and literally like just go do something?  different  not for the sake of being different but for the sake of Desiring a little alone time to see like to see how you feel when you're not with the crowd to see if you're okay. When you move in by yourself to see if you feel fine doing what nobody else wanted to do but knowing that's what you really want to do. So you go do it anyway.  Be that person for yourself. I guarantee you it will build yourself comfort knowing that you can count on yourself to pick yourself up. We put a lot of power into other people resort to putting that back into yourself, you know, take care of yourself.  Show up for yourself pray for yourself. Hey for yourself, do these things knowing that yes.  This is what I wanted to do and I successfully completed that task. Check it off your bucket list travel alone.  Just just just do it. Okay, again, these things are not overnight changes, but learning to  find ways to express yourself.  Comfortably will definitely help with you feeling comfortable about choices and decisions that you make even when nobody else does. We don't want to be feeling broken or less than when or if you know, you're disappointed people are going to disappoint you you don't have to disappoint yourself.  And rolling with yourself and taking care of yourself and doing things for yourself or all positive things and ways to live without disappointment.  Take it from me. Take my advice.  And if this doesn't work out in your favor, which I'm almost certain it will please let me know. Let me know about the times that you cared more about yourself and put effort into yourself better than work for you.  That's it for tonight.  I think this episode may be into segments. I apologize for that.  But I think that this message of promoting being comfortable with oneself. It's so so so important and you know, like I said, we were kids they try to tell us about standing out because you weren't meant to be you know, you don't have to fit in you stand out and  That's I think that's where we at. Just just be yourself like be you.  That's a beautiful thing and it feels safer and sometimes more comfortable to be in a group being a trio. Do you know being a crowd but it feel real good when you could pull up on the crowd.  By yourself and know that I ain't even tripping. I don't even feel some kind of way. Yeah, but do that again. I'll meet you there. Try that try that and see how much stress.  you lack you won't have you'll be free of  keep me posted about it. This is Rise checking out. Enjoy.

So please take a second to go download check it out. See if that making your own podcast.  Hey everyone, welcome to not lost just temporarily misplaced. My name is Raymond French and I'm Ross Damon. Today. We're going to be addressing the mountain in the room. What is outdoor education now, I would like to state that these are our opinions and everyone is entitled to their own. All we ask is that you listen with an open mind as this is a big and complex topic that will be reoccurring over the course of our podcast going forward in different episodes and in different ways.  Through all the episodes now, we do have a plan to begin. One of our classes has this write a paper on what is our personal philosophy of outdoor education, which is pretty much the who what where when how surrounding the outdoors how do you choose the interact with nature and additionally outdoor education, of course, the beauty of philosophy is that everyone has their own View and opinion of everything especially outdoor education. So let's start with that Raw.  Ross what is your personal philosophy of outdoor education? So this is what I stated in my first paragraph of my or my intro paragraph for this final paper that we had to write and I'm going to adjust it a little bit to make it current and make sense. But here we go to me outdoor education is the product of human desire for exploring new ideas wind to find a new way to learn and looking to develop one's understanding of themselves in the world.  My Philosophy is based on the idea that outdoor education is a type of experiential education and think of it like a branch of the bare tree outdoor education covers nature and how to create an experience in it. This can be through Tours guided or not skills workshops and recreational activities. The goal of outdoor education is to create a positive worthwhile and educational experience that Fosters a  A curiosity for being out in nature. Would you agree right I would to an extent. I think that outdoor education is good to bring people to the Natural aspect of life and to bring apart kind of their own educational values to it and bringing nature involved in education is really important but my philosophy and entered case a little bit more different I considered to be rather simple. Actually, I believe that education is a means to getting people not only outside an environment. That is unique.  Different to what they're used to but also for educating them on the importance of preserving and the and knowing if continuing their outdoor experiences, I think it's a fantastic place to build one's self confidence as they Master primitive skills such as Building A Fire or pitching a tent on their own these skills quickly build one self-confidence and Inspire the person to learn more about the Outdoor World around them. The outdoors is also incredibly healthy place for people in a fast traveling world of technology. Now, are you  You sure this isn't because you and Technology just don't really agree and probably couldn't use it if your life depended on it. Yeah, I do struggle a lot with technology, but I that's a bit of my own outdoor education side of the Ross clearly has that mastered and Technology better than I do. He's the one obviously publishing this recording and handling all the editing whatnot, which I appreciate him for but I  I'm not the most technology person but the constant growth of social media and online distractions can influence and affect someone's someone mentally and physically and I agree with that absolutely which is kind of the rationale and correct me if I'm wrong here behind a lot of therapy trips, which is to remove that element of stress that social media and video games and all that can create in your life or even just email they'll really creates for a lot of  People the way I view it is different obviously since you're a therapy person and I'm more of the recreational side get as many people out there enjoying it share it because that'll create kind of a love of it overall. So my view would be along the lines of frontcountry stuff. You should have a shareable memory and a way to share that memory because if you own a guide shopper,  A business or something like that that photo or video upload. The social media is essentially advertising at no cost to your business. See I agree with that aspect of the fact that for advertisements and guiding that's great. But why I think about education I think of the growth as the clients not the person providing the adventure experience per se and so when I think of my outdoor experiences removing Technologies important because  Just everywhere you go almost everybody has a phone these days least from people that we interact with everyone on the phone. Everyone has a Facebook invite as an email account. And so I think it's important that we step away from that because these devices are addictive to us they suck you in they can control you and so I believe that removing yourself from this technological age can be incredibly healthy because suddenly you're back to your roots. You're going hiking and doesn't have to be like you completely shut out your  Phone for a year, it's more like hey for this week long trip. Let's take a disposable camera or a camera that can take pictures and videos but doesn't have a connection to social media and like a GoPro or something small easy to pack that you don't necessarily know and it's going to be kind nice thing to see when you plug it in at the end of your trip, right? It's that that that is what I would recommend.  On my end, of course, there's multiple views of this topic, but I think a GoPro type of camera or something that's quick easy doesn't have any connection to the outside world is perfect. And of course, I do take my phone on camping trips, but I take my phone for emergency purposes only the and of course, I'll need Wilderness you very rarely will have actual cell service or technological actions, but I do have it just in case something happens. What are those what I have my and you'll see a lot of other out  a lot of other major outdoor people also not having their phones with them because they know it's a distraction from the Beauty in front of them as well as the healthy parts of their own lives. I mean Suddenly by hiking and camping and to use your perspective Ross the sea kayaking and rafting they're suddenly doing these strenuous parts that are getting them on healthier sleeping habits and healthier eating habits by removing them from the technology. They're not awake at night. They're not being kept up late in my by the  Phone screen and they're being active which therefore is making you use all that energy that your body is storing up over the course of date of the day eating in and just general healthiness. It's better for you. I always sleep better after doing all these type of activities that I do like I pass out almost immediately if the I would like to add in a recent news article. I did see involving the great state of Vermont which we are right next to currently and  New Hampshire, but one of their politicians I'm blanking on who it is at the moment, but they introduced a bill that would ban anyone under the age of 21 from having a phone. So yeah, that's a little bit radical it is and the whole point of this was to create a topic and kind of get it out there that cell phones can have issues and cause problems especially for  Younger Generations who are a lot more tech savvy Drew. Yeah. I think we agree at different aspects. We read the same thing at different times we do and that's not a bad thing. Yeah, I think it allows us all to share some opinions and have a nice little conversation. And that's all we're having is a nice conversation, which I think more people should be doing they conversation about this topic is important because it doesn't sound serious right now, but it will be in the future.  Yeah, so I think encouraging more conversations like this can encourage growth for the future Generations. Oh, absolutely and this is actually a perfect stopping point. I'd say I think we should pick it up later probably in an episode or two when we get some comments back on our social medias and different ways to get a hold of us such as the anchor app.  I will happily add you in if you download it and leave us a voice message. That's actually probably the best way for you to get your opinion stated here about outdoor education. And even the use of phones will most likely do a whole episode on social media in the coming months. We have a few episodes planned out ahead of that. So we'll see how the order goes. Anyway, thank you all for listening. Please comment and share. We would love to get your ideas and talk about them on the show, obviously.  Lee we can be found on anchor and Spotify and like I said since we're using the anchor app leave us a voice message or a question and we'll add it into the show tune in next week for a new episode and get outside.

You got your Packers Badgers Brewers and a lot of it is going to be on what my friends want to talk about and joining me today is Nate the Great Bear Hagan Nate say hi to the people. Hello party people. There we go. You got to have friends in this world. And when you're making podcasts, I think you need an even more try talking to yourself for 10 minutes in a dark room and taking yourself. Seriously not possible not possible.  Oh, so a little bit about what this podcast is all about. I want to start with what this podcast isn't I think that there's a lot of really great podcasts out there that talk about Wisconsin Sports already. There's a lot of people that know what the hell they're talking about on those podcasts. We don't we definitely do not know we're not experts I think the most sports winning of sadhana really been the high school level and not  That's a really done anything since then you could you could freshman year rowing if you really want to count. Okay freshman, you're rowing. All right, cool. True. I remember we all got recruited to the Wisconsin Badgers rowing team. If you are over like six 480 pounds, you got a letter you get a letter. Yeah. I also wrote those letters to those kids know you were recruiter I had to recruit. Okay, so we do have a little bit of badger experience here on the podcast joining us today. Yes, sir a little bit more about what this podcast.  Is not this podcast will not provide you up-to-the-minute coverage on anything now every once in a while, we'll hit some breaking news such as the Antonio Brown released today by the Patriots scoop. I hope this is still recording it is okay. All right, we might be able to trim that out. We might not anyway, we keep going. We also don't have any journalistic credibility. It's not a zero, none coming scientist trying to help get in the Sports World couple biologist stretching our legs out here a little bit. So we're going to see how this goes.  Goes without saying we don't have any training to do this. We're using an app that I'll say its name once they pay me to do it, but they have a lot of nice tools and you're making this really user-friendly for us. So we're just gonna see what we can do. We also will recommend that you don't take any fantasy or Sports gambling advice from us now, we will talk about that quite a bit on this show, but please do not hedge any actual money on any BS that gets set on this podcast on the over a Leo.  Now I want to sweat the onion so a little bit about what this podcast is is and what it's going to be. It's going to be conversations between just a bunch of guys who have some similar interests some different interests. There's gonna be a lot of different people popping in and out of this podcast. I hope if it survives more than episode of do couple of guests couple of guests. We're going to have we got Brewers guy who reads the blog comments online.  QA websites, we've got Minnesota Vikings fans that I you know, God forsaken friends with and so they're going to be popping in every once in awhile. There's going to be some banter is going to be some trash talk is going to be steaming hot takes completely uneducated and founded most of the time but they're going to be hot. I'm gonna be in your face and then we're, you know, just going to talk about what we hope.  Somebody else likes to listen to I know I like to listen to it. So maybe you will maybe you won't but so we're gonna we're just going to go ahead.  Alright and we're back after that riveting intro Nate the Great how you doing? I'm doing well doing well. So big part of what we're going to try and do at the time filler podcast is get to know these guys and what they want to talk about what sports as Nate mentioned before he's got a season of Wisconsin Badger rowing that I think we'd all love to hear a little bit about why don't you want to tell people that story? Yeah, so, you know at so  Roaches the orientation every year we we get recruited if you're above the height of 6 feet pretty much and you know, they saw me I was a little thin little undersized but try it out be better than you are. Now you look pretty thin to die. You know, I was a little thicker that ground. Yeah. Yeah, she's on but but you know really wasn't hard to make the team if you want to play d 1 and d 1 sport.  I'd recommend growing but yeah overall it was a good time good time good experience. Good good. Any particular reason that you didn't go out for your sophomore year, why did the rowing team lose you you know, it was hard. Yeah. That's that's not a great excuse. No, but you know I wanted to I wanted to take my time Deuce do other things ended up with you here and right and in lab, that's right. So, I don't know that I'd be here right now.  Doing this podcast if it weren't for my lack of drive in that area, you know, they say God has a plan for everything and it seems like time filler podcast was was Manifest Destiny. Yeah. Now that I think of it, I think if I were to make that decision again, it would have been a lot easier knowing I'd end up on this podcast see Saul you all your freshman rumors out there. Keep in mind if it gets too hard there might be something better for you on the other side. Yeah.  All right, I'll save you so Nate has been involved with more than just rolling as of late. I believe you have a little bit of a bike ride. You're going on this weekend big big bike ride, you know, we together do little bit of cancer research, which is awesome. But this bike ride is a fundraiser for cancer research. So actually we have we've had grants in the past, right? Yeah, and we've been funded by the funds raised by this bike race, right, right. So doing a hundred miles.  Hundred miles lightwork the century the century the century is something kind of cool is I've only like 50 miles Max before that. So I'm going to have to have to double the mileage. Well, I mean, I've done it once you can do it twice, right? It doesn't have anything that is what the I don't know is that the kids are saying that's what the kids are saying these days. All right. Well, how about some more local news? We've got a big game here at Camp Randall this weekend a game big blue coming to town.  What do you think about that? What does a we're going to save the score prediction, but what do you expect to see here on Saturday man? I mean Jonathan Taylor down the throat sounds of throw Bucky by million, but you buy a Millions. It's it's gonna happen. You know, I don't know what Michigan has Jim Harbaugh Jim, right Jim Jack Jimmy James Aunt Jim friends. Call him Jim. Okay. Yeah James James. He's kind of on the thin ice for his job. I think so. He's like, yeah, Michigan needs a win.  Looks like more of a figurehead than a successful head coach at this point. I would agree. I mean lots of recruiting you want to talk about over ranked programs in the nation. The Wolverines have got to be up there last was it last week against Navy two weeks ago. They took my last week two weeks ago against Navy wenzhou T may be just about right at the ship their the end to yeah, I did there a greater voice. Everyone likes a good pun all aboard. So I would have to think that the Badgers offense  Has the same rushing ability at least with Jonathan Taylor is what Navy did all right with a little bit of razzle-dazzle in the past and Department little bit of little bit surprised little bit Yeah, Razzle Dazzle Razzle Dazzle who you were then throw out there Jack Cohen, I as as my buddies know I'm I want to see grammar. It's early and often seems like I'm gonna have to wait a year for that. So Jack on it is Jack on it is that kind of is better than Jill stop it.  No, stop it. Shut up. Stop it watch.  Alright, so, let's see. I've also I've also got a little bit of an update here fantasy wise. Oh, I would say for all of you listeners out there who are going through a tough quarterback time Nate understands. You haven't seen much worse that I think no, I would say that. Let's see. You're rolling out Matthew Stafford In Case Keenum this weekend.  Yeah, why don't why don't you talk to people about what your strategy is right now coming off Owen to write is trying to get some momentum going right? So, you know my fantasy team. I'm a I'm an old-time conservative fantasy player. I like I like the guys who were once good and then I like them on my team when they're currently bad. Yeah. It's always like a scheme is there well, Case Keenum great college quarterback. I love college quarterbacks. But so Case Keenum he I believe  Is fit and fantasy actually has a good year. He has I think he's planning on the Bears, which that's not cool you down a little bit might have negative points this week. But Drew Brees got me negative points last week. So nothing's going to change their no gotta go up. But yeah, but between Matthew Stafford and Case Keenum, I originally had Cam Newton and Drew Brees both of which are out this week. So well Cam Newton questionable but projection of point zero.  Row so what does that tell you not good? Yeah, it's questionable, but it's a zero point. So I mean, I think he was ruled out here earlier today. He's out breaking news you regular news. You heard it here first on the time filler podcast Cam Newton out for this we can get them out of your fantasy lineups. Yeah. All right. So we're gonna we're gonna wrap up this segment with with a little bit of hot takes I haven't come up with what we're going to call it. But I want your hottest Sports take heading into the weekend whether it's a prediction or a dismissal.  Something that's gonna really ruffle the feathers of somebody in the audience. What do you got was Bucky by million not enough for you. Oh, wow Bucky by a million. All right, so so there's a score prediction. So thinking back on it, you know, if I do want to get a real real predict prediction here Antonio Brown is going to jail.  Wow, yeah believe it's a civil case. So you're really going on a limb there. I think I think I think it's going to turn into a little bit more. Okay, I don't know much about it was between the helmet. I think I think yeah. Well, we'll see. Alright that is that is a Stevie hot take that civil cases going to end up putting him behind bars a political guy. But yeah, I think we're going straight to it. So so I'm gonna dive in here with my hat take for the weekend.  Just going to say this the Jets and the Dolphins are setting historic standards for for money lines here this weekend. I believe we've got like a minus 20 and a half for the Dolphins and a - 21 for the Jets. And here's what I'm going to say. There was a wise man who once said he doesn't bet on football because the ball isn't round anything can happen if you want to turn 10 bucks into something fancy for the weekend think about putting some on the Jets of the dolphin just saying, I'm just saying you saying you want  That on day I'm not worried about the over-under. I'm taking the or the money line right taking the line. Oh, man, you put you put 10 bucks on the Jets this weekend. You're walking out with some money for Monday morning with Sam Darnell the mono. I got that freshman year of college. He's getting it is is what third year in FL you kidding boys Peak late some boys Peak late. Alright. Alright. Well that does it for us?  Here on the time filler podcast. We're going to see how many sites wanna put this crap out there. See what sticks next time. I'll be joined by possibly Nate again possibly different guess you just don't know what you're gonna have the time filler. So thanks again for joining and go Bucky go pack go bruised making a playoff push. Great time to be Wisconsin sports fan.	So big part of what we're going to try and do at the time filler podcast is get to know these guys and what they want to talk about what sports as Nate mentioned before he's got a season of Wisconsin Badger rowing that I think we'd all love to hear a little bit about why don't you want to tell people that story?  So, I don't know that I'd be here right now.

spotify:episode:0pwyn4ZDciLieGw7RXHGLg	Death foosball is to work in that's fighting League the next one immediately puts we came out of the toy faster.  traces of luck in a comfortable  We welcome you to another episode of this fighter Bundesliga podcast and it's been another busy week of football over the weekend much they 30 is over and done with and we look forward to having a look at all the action coming up to to us on Match Day 31. I'm your host Matthew carry. It's a pleasure to have your company once again joining me today to do.  Dress everything in my chest 8:30 and review and preview much. They 31 is the lovely Eva Eva. How you doing? How are you? Good. Thank you very much. Excellent. And of course, we've once again brought in a Val field becomes English Twitter man, Elliot Turnbull Elliot. How you doing today?  Yeah, I'm good. Thanks. Hope that everyone had a good Easter. Yes, of course the wonderful weekend of eating plenty of chocolate and of course watching plenty of football and we had plenty of goals on the weekend which leads us to our first game, which is Heidenheim versus sankt Pauli Heidenheim comfortable winners three ghosts in the over the Hamburg side marks natural opening the scoring on 18 minutes and then two goals in the space of three minutes from Nicola David on  Making it's a nice easy sweep for Frank Smith sides either. I'm going to start with you. It's probably best to start with sankt Pauli. It looks like their potential tilts of the playoff is over and it hasn't been a particularly bright star under your Luke. I knew and I think it's was once again really poor 45 first 45 minutes the same against the media and  and yeah, it's  Like to concede three Golds under 30 minutes. It's really bad. And then you don't deserve to have a saying and in the promotion and I think most of those aren't quality friends. I talked to already like they didn't expect to get promoted. But still they should look out that they don't end the season was a bunch of defeats.  Yeah, greedy. I mean it would it would almost waste what has been a pretty decent season for the sides and Elliot you look at Heidenheim a great win for them. You know, we spoke prior to starting the recording that they've been a bit off. So to speak comfortable win and surprisingly they're still very much in the hunt for that for at least the playoff spot.  Yeah, definitely only two point mile off other born in sin third, which is remarkable given where the work a month and bit ago. But yeah against going to go absolute self-destruction for don't power lead agency few teams have a word recent record in the league than them. But yes for some reason Frank Schmidt has been he loves playing against FC st. Pauli, especially home prior to this it was for home game.  Four victories is not made up five and five just to add to the misery. But again precious got to be building on leak. I change of manager usually expect some sort of positive reaction that's just not happened with them probably and yeah very much looking forward for both of them to tell their own in a few weeks because their team objects of confidence at just that they've got nothing to play for now. They're just completely busted it which is surprising given how strong they looked.  Early on in the season. Yeah and a team that isn't lacking any confidence whatsoever is paderborn and they were one of the big winners on matchday 30. They beat Horse Town kill two goals to 1 at the holster and study on Messiah or could go opening the scoring and then it was all paderborn type Raga and Christopher actually a giant getting the two goals and it means that paderborn move ahead of onion billion into third place and they sit only two points behind Hamburg and  Elliot's we spoke about it last week that part of born were in a really good position to to potentially overtake or neon and now you'd almost say that they're in a good position to even eclipse homburg.  Yeah, what agree completely over a lot. They had a bomb with a real winners of the game weak teams around them talking points. It was crucial that they got the victory at Keele. And I mean, it's bizarre that the teams are top seem to be having blips and form don't know if they're choking or not. Whereas in stark contrast that part of almost being absolutely on fire won four of the last five drawing the other game if there's a time to get form and really  Conan had momentum for that potential third place play-off. It's now and two points of Hamburg Inn in second. There's no reason why they couldn't LeapFrog them given that they can't find a win at the moment. So as annoying as people may find it seemed kinda bomb flying well credit where it's due they deserve to be where they are agreed. They played great football. They had plenty of shots on Dominic riemann's goal and and it has to be said kill hold out for as long as  as they could but eventually paddleboards dominance really took over and and Eva, you know, I guess from a cure perspective that essentially kills off the promote sort of the playoff attempt for them. What do you think? What did you think of their overall performance against paderborn it and what should we look out for them going forward? Well, I think it was the game we expected it to be last week, but it's  Also, the thing that we talked about potable is really strong and I think here may have like taking it all too easy after their first goal. Like they had a really good first half but  it's yeah it there weren't really after that first goal. They should have had more chances or use their chances to higher the score sheet on their behalf, but they didn't and then it's really really difficult to to win against pas de born if they get one back or so. So yeah, I think we talked about it last week that this is going to be like a decision.  Whoever is going to win will be more likely to have anything in the promotion and that was yeah, it was decided and that's why I think he'll is going to end like 5 5 V place or so. But yeah, they have really really good season which we have to say. We spoke about a plenty of times there were better than expected with a come with a new coach and all that. So still have a lot of  They showed a lot of Courage throughout the season. I have indeed healed me. They may feel hard done by both. I know that we've discussed today are fair amount, but I could go I scored a perfectly good goal after a lovely cross from Mateo contact, which was ruled out for offside. So potentially next season with that introduction of the technology that goal counts could have been a different story. But to be fair, I believe the three points were rightly due for potable.  Yeah, agreed on that one. Another team that took a massive step in the way of avoiding relegation was dinner with Dresden three-nil over the league leaders after cone Eric berko chiming in with a brace on 12 the torment and the 67th Harris do leave each with a nice goal as well. It means that Dresden are almost automatically safe from the director relegation place and  Eva, you know the it was a an interesting performance, I guess from Dresden. They didn't have a lot of the ball, but when they went forward, they took their chances and they took the three points. Yeah. Definitely. I think two people that were mainly involved word olegovich and bakal. I think they were the main part of the device and game and what was really interesting that Kony wasn't in the squad.  I think there was a bit surprising for many people but I think Grayson had this Aid Wonder feed in their minds and wanted to give their fans something bad because they were amazing supporting away in Kern last year. And I you saw the current had a lot of difficulties to come back into the game and then as he cites a huge win for today stand  It's cone. Third game parole without win. Yeah, and I think Kelly it would be wrong of us to not talk about the defensive.  Mistakes from from Kern the three goals. They all from long balls or in every way the third goal obviously coming from a set piece but really suspect suspect defending but as they say if you have the chance to take you must take it and Dresden certainly did.  Yes, I agree completely that is having incredible to watch out. Especially the first two goals is just a long hoof from The Dresden goalkeeper, which somehow cut through there sa defense and credit where it's due to decent finishes past Tebow home, but I don't know why it happened in this much but they just couldn't defend against the long Ball. But this game is a perfect example. Why is The Possession start is one of the most useless?  Phones in football think if you look at the stats, they make quite funny reading the visitors way from home. They had six seven percent of the ball dominated possession, but really did nothing with it. They have no lethal touch didn't really create any chances and with with Justin really three four, click or chances and you've got three goals are so got to give credit to Christian feel think his tactics were brilliantly work very very well nullified.  Can call them on the break with the long ball a few times and yeah, it's really turned it around there and think good appointment. It was practicing to bring him in and yeah should see dress them in need site illegal next year that we should I will take a quick breather will go to our group two games in just a moment. We'll start in firts when they host it on your on Billy. And so that's kind of how we start our group two games in firts.  As they hosted on your own balloon and the spoils were shared in this one one goal a piece your shoe. Mm. He's opening the scoring and then three minutes after Daniel caterer. Well was sent off but a very good second half performance by greater efforts Marcus caligiuri scoring on 67 minutes. Then onion themselves reduced to ten men nickel L rap was the man Scent of a funny old game this one Elliot's this just I just  Just can't help but feel this was a missed opportunity for on your own and that second half was really ordinary.  Yeah, I think if anything we don't were lucky to even come over Point here. They were abysmal lacks any real Christmas going forward May talking points from the game would stupid red cards either side one was a petulant push after a bad Challenge from Paul yet has other one was just disgusting to footing challenge, which was rightly so red card for rat, but I mean contrasted to paderborn we're going to the  This end of the season this is when you want to be getting good form, you know, really playing well and truly on did they just can't find him a win-loss to on a bounce now prior to that the drones three in a row again with Harris foul. There's even couldn't drop in point. This is an ideal position to really cement your claim for that third position now, but again, it's a waste opportunity and if we're gonna go on form and which team you would  rather not play at the moment other born are looking hot some favorite to potentially solidify that third or even second spot. Yeah. It is theirs for the taking is either we have to bring under greater for a good point for them against the team that is now sitting in fourth position that they've looked better under Stephen light. Although they've certainly improved defensively and and especially like that second half when it was ten men of peace. They really had it really looked like they were going to go and take the  Yeah, definitely. They were closer to school then on your own which is a bit surprising because for food the season is more or less over. They won't get relegated or won't get promoted. And then you expect on your own to be the team that invest more in the game and it wasn't that way and they like they were 40 minutes or so or 30 minutes. They were one man down and  and it was really extraordinary performance. You could say against a team you might fear to to concede many goals. And yeah. Yeah, I think they're definitely better than more stable in the defense than there were before and yeah, you could you can see that Stephen that I could bring some confidence back into the team. I'd say he certainly has an A team that could use a little bit of confidence.  Haas vow they were held to a 100 draw to ask a burger our Philip zulekha opening the scoring. He took advantage of a mistake by yulian pull us back at the set piece and then manual Vince Homer in his first start for Hartsville capping that off with a goal. That's not a particularly good point for heartfelt. They continue to drop points at home. They actually have more away points this season than they do at home and even  Eva I think they're starting to get a little bit nervous in Hamburg as teams are starting to not only close but potentially surpass. Yeah. Definitely. I think okay, you have to say paderborn as I said before is the winner of this match day, but like our isn't the best team in the league. It's like though one draw one of book called draw against cone was was more  As win a win for them, especially concerning their confidence but against our it's two less definitely and if they pay like that if they go into the playoff spot, they I'm not quite sure that they will be the winner because it's like there were so many mistakes. Not only by Paula's bag but everywhere  Air and it isn't enough just to play 45 minutes or being eager to win this game. It's not enough. Yeah, and it almost makes you question that had the makeup of the squad. They've been obviously in the top three for so long but this is it has to be said under Hannah's fall for this is the first time they've looked vulnerable and teams are starting to figure out figure them out. They've been atrocious at home. I think they've really let their home fans down in many games this season.  He's and and to allow teams to almost dictate in such a way is really poor for them. And and you know, if they continued the trend of form that they may miss out altogether and that in itself, would it be extraordinary and and Elliot? Certainly? We will talk about it later on in the preview, but with a result like this, it makes their upcoming fixtures. So important.  Hey did it does completely and especially with palpable on winning? The pressure really is on they can feel them breathing down their necks. Yeah, just agree with what said you have to feel for how it's all funds and Hannah's wolf is under increasing pressure. Personally. I don't know what's going on. I don't know where that they're loving the league so much sir. First year of psychic. One of the other one has to want to stay for a few more years because  The in the world but just- tactics trying to grind out one-nil victories home away from home and when our are coming to such a big and historic Club in dictating how the games being played along those have got to be ringing those tactics maybe work in the Bundesliga more when you're all of the small teams, but coming down. I don't have fairly high expectations of Hamburg the budget larger than most  their players are incredible, but for some reason they just can't and have a performance that the hunters wolf. And yeah, I mean just looking at this weekend's their trip to London Berlin this weekend that is a potential season decider for both clubs are which we'll discuss later but pressure is on that is two teams that probably don't have well don't have the same amount of pressure with darmstadt and barking they played the only new new of the match day.  Both teams had their chance to living hinges are had the best of those Elliot's probably wasn't the particular a particularly eye-catching fixture. But I mean, I think Demetrius grim. What'ss and Robert saw in the end wouldn't be too opposed to sharing the points. Yeah. This definitely wasn't one for the neutral. Yeah. I mean, I guess it's a clean sheet away from home and appoints a bottom dumpsters.  Well, they keep up their unbeaten form whose form is incredibly changed since doctors came in and yeah from a tactical point is quite clear to see that both coaches knew each other. Well, obviously kilometers before Dom start. He was head of our yoga and youth team and yeah tactics potentially canceled them out. Both teams sort of seemed to know how the other one was going to play Chances are few and far.  Satan inside hint Isaiah had to 1/2 chance one. Okay, where he fired a volley just over the crossbar but appoint is fair and to be honest. It's 90 minutes that I'm never going to get back that is indeed leave those group two games behind us and we'll take a quick break group three offerings are just around the corner. We're going to start in bielefeld when they hosted Ingolstadt. Let's carnal Goethe.  Kitty  Yes, and we start the group 3 games in Armenia. They hosted Ingolstadt and well, I crucial win another one of the big winners were Ingolstadt 3-1 the final score. My cell gasps took advantage of Stefan Ortega's mishandling in the first half for a set-piece Stefan Kutcher. Yep. He's still exist. He scored just after half time and then Thomas applied or who of course will be gone for two to Dusseldorf at the end of the season he  Chimed in for gold Andreas Vogel stammer who of course was courted by English that he scored armenia's one and only goal the win season course that only a point behind magdeburg in 16th Place, but we'll start with Armenia Eva very very cool. But please take us well, I think you could say the first half was quite like there's probably first half we  I'd say we were the dominant team I think especially for guys I'm I had plenty of chances. They Armenia was I'd say the better team until the English dad go but once again using your chances, it's very important. It doesn't matter who you playing. You always should use them and I mean you didn't and yeah, then that mistake by Ortega. I don't want to talk about it too much because he was a really important factor.  The season so I think he's granted one mistake. I think we shouldn't talk about that too much and then that second have apparently a mini has some problems with being awake at the start of the second half. Yeah coach Kerr and I know that he like I forgot that he still exists and then that 3-nil was a huge mistake by Florian heart. It's like you could watch him lose the ball like  Riously, if you look at that goal, you can see that he has no idea what he's doing going bag and then have of our dear friends are saying no you got the ball. No, you got it and nobody got it except cleaner. Yeah, and then yeah, at least we had one goal on the score sheet with with Foggers Emma, which was a good really good free. Kick. It was his first converted free Kick this season. He tried to plenty of times. But yeah, it's not a like  I'm not really happy I make travel back from vacation eight hours. Got up at 6 a.m. On Saturday. It's beautiful and I love my team. It's so good to travel through half Germany to see my team getting defeated. It's so great. And even of course was the only one who predicted that Ingolstadt was gonna win that game. So I guess Elliot it's a crucial win obviously finger will start since  Thomas also has taken over seven points out of a possible nine two wins on the road a point now behind magdeburg.  There's see that they're slowly making form and add at this time of the season of this is the time to pick up form paddleboard. We've spoken about at just our will but English at now starting to pick up points at the right time and they are very much a player in this push for the playoff yet. Definitely just the one point now after magdeburg lost weekend separating them from 16th spot. So yeah two wins for the last three it is the right time.  Stop picking up fold. But yep, glad to hear that either had a nice Easter Sunday watching, you know Fells, I'm going to defend Ortega slightly here. It was definitely his mistake for the gold but personally think even worse wasn't manual little defending. He just fell asleep in the Box Stood Still didn't pick up his player easy had a home and overnight house was rightly feeding on the touch home because all three of those things  Gunshot goals were just woeful woeful woeful defending which said that know usually you wouldn't associate with bielefeld. But yep credit where it's due single stack could could make a very very very late survival. They couldn't did. I know you've got no house had smoke coming out of his ear and his face was as red as a tomato speaking of a team that wears red. That is Ian Regensburg. They took on mags of pork one-nil.  That marker grown up on 20 minutes getting the goal. It is taught the season Ian going to 7th magdeburg looking over their shoulder as we've said before Elliot not a whole lot got went right for magdeburg. They have to be really concerned now heading down the stretch that they could not only be caught but they could also see themselves going down at the drill again next season.  Yeah, bug bug could have be heading straight back down huge win for for yarn but quite Scrappy am really tensed Shield far between again, it just comes down to when you don't want to lose your form Mike Burg. Yeah, the picked up a couple of decent draws the win incredible when against Hamburg, but yeah, that's now two defeats on the back. They're not playing with confidence.  Weren't very inspiring to the weekends again yarn. So yeah, I mean huge pictures for both clubs this weekend, but English stack could it mean that hosting Justin? They've got little too playful despite their heroics home to could so I wouldn't be really surprised if they could Leap Frog magdeburg. Yeah. It's in the offing for them. And it's yeah, they've almost it's almost seems like the last few weeks. They've been it's with the  Ian of the the Hamburg game they've been holding onto some to a massive advantage and now as they look at the table that massive event Advantage is just one team that is in the Drop Zone in last place is duisburg. They hosted son housing and they came from two guys behind to salvage a draw Andrew Woodson has continued his magnificent form. He should be wearing the red white and blue some would say and he proved so two guys for him.  It's a good flight back from duisburg Harvard Nelson who's obviously tortellini clicks one of his favorite players and Kevin volts a scoring from the penalty spot just a few minutes before stoppage time giving duisburg a glimmer of hope Eva but it is really a glimmer of hope. We all probably would agree that it's going to be extraordinarily hard for them to stay up. But nonetheless they keep themselves just in the hunt. Yeah, I think what was important for their  Ends is that they reacted to to or first half where they had more chances and sound Heusen was barely to be seen and liked. It was a copy of the first goal in the second half as well and just was really missing like Christy Shin in front of in front of the goal. But I think than 2,000 can live with one point way more.  Do spoken there is no six games without a win guess who's going to be their next opponent. Just not going to predict anything for that Monday game because we all know how it's going to end. I think it was really important for them that they got back into the game that they saved a point, but it's two less for them. And I think no matter if they're going  To win next week or not. They will go down. It does look very likely that they will and that concludes our review of match day 30 and coming up is our preview for the upcoming matches a massive week of football will take a quick break and we'll bring it all to you.   Yes, so we welcome you to the match day 31 preview and we have some massive games to go through and none bigger than this one on your own Boolean versus Hamburg has fell fourth hosting second. But where will these teams be at the end of the match day that is to be determined. This is only the second ever meeting between the two sides and when they met in Hamburg, it was a two or Draw with  La he scoring the equaliser in stoppage time Elliot. We spoke at nauseam eats each side really really struggling no wins in their previous five league matches for both sides. This is a season defining match for both teams. That is certain.  Yep, and this one should be a thriller quite fun already. Both teams got the exact same form over the past five and neither team look like they want to leave the FICA Liga both joking when it matters, but Hamburg picked up more points away from home. They don't like taking the game and being that attacking side. So if anything that suits Hannibal's tactics a bit more here, so yeah, I would but  Humbug, hit that long. Long long overdue. I went however from a neutral perspective. It will be a lot more exciting if we only on could get them because then that would just being with three games to go that would make it such an exciting finish to the league book is great though. It's so competitive and mean down from 2nd to 5th and hide mine feasibly any one of those teams could finish in the they could all be rotating. So  Yeah, I would put my neck on the line and say Hamburg here, but I'm not sure how you say it. So it's a difficult one to call. Yeah, I'm going to sit on the fence the very tall fence. That is I like I say this one ending a goal of Peace can see on snatching a drawer late. I do agree with you though the tactics that onion like to play wil will play into the hand of Hannah's false side, but I can't I just can't see.  Either team taking a win in this one either. Do you agree with Elliot that hamburger starts to win or do you agree with myself or do you think on Ian will take the three points? No, I agree with you Matthew. I think I have a drawl written down here as well. And I think the both team will focus on not making any mistakes and that's why it's going to be very poor fensively and maybe like a one all draw so but I don't see a winner. Yeah. I feel like we are  Almost as neutrals in this scenario are waiting for the ultimate chaos scenario, which would see Heidenheim beating paderborn, which is the game. We're going to preview now. They take the win a draw in Copper Nick and then it's just total pandemonium heading into the final few games. This is only the fourth meeting between the two sides and when they met last time at the voice Arena, it was 5 1 2 paderborn, of course portable. One of the in-form sides of this seat at the  moments and it perfectly poised to take that second position Eva. Do you see part of born holding the fort at home or do you think Heidenheim could really throw the cat amongst the pigeons here? No, I'd say it's again the paderborn wind. I was sort of right the last time you never know. But yeah, I think they're just they're really want to manifest or so.  The third place or even like really really challenged on your own in-house foul. And I think they're just a bit more eager to win and that's we're going to put them on Elliott's would you share the sentiments or would you go in a different direction?  Again it I I don't like predicting the drawers I could see this ongoing and then go all squared but it's clear to see what Frank's been were used to motivate. His players are having been humiliated 5-1 at home. They're going to be chomping at the bit to come and seek their revenge against Panda born. I can really see them coming out one thing to make up for that.  Should yeah boss and thousand these are the to inform teams in the league. I want to fix the hired time when but I could see this being an entertaining score draw to be honest. Yeah, we certainly wait and see the last of our group on games is at st. Pauli. They host Ian Regensburg. The two sides are 8th and 7th respecting respectively if I could speak English, this is only the sixth meeting between the two sides.  It's and Yan have won this fixture more than their opponents Marco gruner. And so I guess Adam Young are the top scorers with Frankie. Simbolo all paying all from yarn with two girls Elliot. This is a massive game in particular for Yost Luke why it has not been an ideal start is only of course the only been here for two matches. So we maybe have been a bit harsh but they've been very poor in first house in games and a team like Ian who are very  Out on the road could take full advantage.  Yep, I would agree completely there but pressure is on and I think even so for good disagree with my prediction here, but only the overdue when there's only so long as abysmal form can continue for I know that initially he's not a direct flights hopeful but given two to three weeks and I training ground try and get some of his ideas across I do.  They will get back to winning ways here. And again, yep yarn. They got the one know when we can begin to Michael Berg, but even in that they weren't overly inspiring. So I'm gonna yep sit Madam Ireland predictors in Parliament. Well, I'm gonna just screw you and I'm gonna say that Jana is how shocking I'm gonna pick you on to win. I think they just have the tools. I think I think yeah, I mean they can take full advantage in that first half and I think that's where they'll do the damage it.  It's like st. Pauli like under your the officer who Kai remnants of some slow cook pork ribs. They take a long time to get nice and tender and and get into that Peak sort of tasting area and I'm talking about food because I'm really hungry. But that's what they are. They take they take a long time to cook correctly. And then eventually they get better in the second half but good teams will put them away early Heidenheim did that.  Bielefeld should have done that and I think yeah, no, we'll do that. So then Ava it goes to you. We have two separate results. I'm just going to take a hunch that you may be thinking different to both of us. No, so as Elliott might suggest a door already. I'm going to beg yarn here because for the same reason that you just said Matthew like some curly didn't even manage to get a win.  Just us and and just going to say here that he and there's a better team than we are. So if some curly is not improving their really bad performance in the first 45 minutes there were definitely lose it if you're still okay, we'll find a way to improve that then they might get a point of out of it, but I'm not saying anything more than 1.4 then apparently they have it group one in the books group to in.  Just a moment cone will host darmstadt and that's our first game.  Yes, we start the group two games in Kern. They host dumb stats. This is the 12th meeting between the two sides and darmstadt have never won this mixture, of course cone are almost at the Pearly Gates of the Bundesliga, but they may have to wait just another week before they can taste promotion and Eva. I mean, it's we're probably going to just talk about killing here.  It's a game. They should win obviously poor result last time out expect a response in front of the home fans. You expect Kiln to win.  Yeah, definitely their home their way better and the past weeks then they are away I'd say so I definitely say it's going to be a win for concurrent. Would you share the sentiments?  Yeah, it's ain't ya - I'm shocked why we try and put it in there because it wouldn't no one would have predicted Dresden beating curve or even Ingolstadt Armenia bath either for of course, but now as well as d'amigo Moses has done turning things around dumpster. I can't see past can have not been to not be like the best lately. Yeah their funds are going to be  Expecting to win here. There's not one in their last three. So I'd expect a can with but wouldn't write off darmstadt. Obviously, they went 1-1 in Hamburg as well. But I think it's only a matter of time before can come win and really cement their spot back in the Bundesliga. Yeah. It's really hard to not pick them record is superb against armed stats that have one of the equal top scorers and Anthony my desk playing can't go past it. We will move on to  to duisburg who play the Monday night kickoff against Armenia bielefeld. This is the 46th meeting between the two sides and all competition and duisburg have a good recent history over them unbeaten in their last four. They beat them in the cup this season. It looks in terms of history as if do Sports should win this game, but and after a poor performance against English at either the expectation will be an improved performance on  Day, yes, and because like every statistic smolder speaks Romanian this week six gaming in a row without a win. I mean, yeah is the feeder induced book since 2009. But yeah, I do not think this will continue to go like, okay, I'd say it's going to be a draw.  Because this book is still in a different place than English. Don't was when they travel to to bielefeld. But yeah, I do no think I mean he's going to win this. It's a tricky game to predict. I mean do sports records says a lot especially against Armenia, but I think I think the fact that they were so bad on the weekend.  Like I can see Armenia getting a results against that defense who knows we could see six goals because both teams have been a bit iffy defensively. I don't know how you feel about this area. It's would you can you see any team getting a result in this game?  Yeah, I can see Barbie to get a result. They're going to be expecting to bounce back from a woeful performance of the weekend. And yeah, there's a reason why these Burgers so low in the table, so I would expect I mean it's weird and really start to cement their place needs really good next season. Yeah. It's so it seems set in stone. It's almost waiting for the inevitable inevitable to happen and  Team, that will be hoping that that's doesn't fall upon them as English that they of course host Dena more Dresden. They won this fixture last time out and it is the talk meeting. However in the previous 11 six of those have been draws. This one is quite a tough game to predict Elliot's at the Audi Sport Park. They haven't won Under New Management manager Thomas oral at home. Is this the day they do it.  I can trick you want to predict? Yeah, I think part of the automobile in came mrs. Probably going to be one of the ones to watch in this game week both teens cream on the back of incredible results of the weekend who will be able to kick on personally. I see ending in a draw Paul though. That would be no good for English that really they will need to get pick up a Victorian to yeah, I think correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think they've won.  Mm speaking bottom a couple of months back now so that I'm not going to be expecting that in woeful all season, but it's a huge opportunity Dresden maybe obviously brilliant result against Kern but I mean the Champions are in town you're going to raise your game there. They've got nothing to play for maybe they'll be complacent which will allow Ingolstadt to win. But I yeah, I'm it's impossible to predict League. I don't know what why we try  We do it for the fun of it. That's why we enjoy it either. How do you see this game going? I mean obviously Dresden as Elliot's reminded us coming off the highs of beating the leaders. Will they carry or will they fall? It's really really difficult to predict. I have Grayson written down as the winner. I think the problem for both sides is that there might have too much self-confidence.  after winning on the weekend, I think that's the main thing they have to to focus on it's going to be really difficult for both sides because they play both teams played completely different opponent to to the previous week, but I still think that there is no might have some advantages here and because they don't have anything to lose and that's why  why I think there might be a bit Yeah a bit more loose and playing and that's why I think I'd say they win. It will be an interesting fixture that is for sure. Our we've got three games left to preview. We're going to start that in San house and when they host Holstein Kiel,   Yes, and we start in sand house and they host whole Stein kill. This is only the sixth meeting between the two sides when they met last time out host on kill were two one winners and interestingly enough kill have never won in sand Heusen. So Elliot's based on that.  Can kill get of winning sound house and or will send Houston and Andrew Woodson be the difference.  I think he'll can get a point not too sure about a win here. Sometimes them like inform team in the league at the moment picked up 12 points or potential 15 and It's A Small Miracle Hue Kushner has worked at the club. They can be full of confidence. Again Keel not nothing really to play for the got no promotion hopes anymore. So yeah. Sorry Betty man, boringly. I know.  If potentially a draw here, but I think there's nothing stopping sound thousand increasing the dominant home form away against host and kill here. I don't know how you see this picture of panning out. It's a tough one, obviously son house and have improved it almost feels like they improved overnight and they went from being absolutely hopeless to just on fire and I'm not entirely sure I think the key I think I think and I've brought him up because  He's been absolutely dominant force on houses. But if you know if I his Andrew wouldn't ability to influence the game and get on the scoresheet kill win the game. I'm pretty certain of that. There's been a Reliance and him to get them back up and he's done such he's done that but you know, they this is the kit that the good teams have more than one guy finding the back of the net and I don't think they've got that. Well they had  It was slow as nobody he is injured so it will be interesting and I think Eva when you look at Keele, you know, you want to finish the season off strong lee-san housing isn't a particularly easy opponent, especially at home. What will they need to do to get the points here? And well, I think it's not that different to how they played against polar bond. They just like especially I think with Uncle gather they have  A really good man up front and they think they will be eager to show a reaction to after taking the lead should lose a game and I think xanto's in is a good way to start here. It's as you said, it's a really difficult game as well to predict because and house and has a lot to lose and yeah, we spoke about quiles more or less out of  the talk about promotion. So yeah, but I think he will wants to find a way to end this good season in all right way and yeah, that's why I go with Keel although than 2,000 will make a tough game out of it that they will indeed. The second of our group through games is in magdeburg. They'll host grow. Its of furth massive game for magdeburg with the inform Ingolstadt.  At their heels. This is only the second meeting between the two sides that when they did play invert. It was a 3-2 win for the host plenty to play for Eve of course foot can get themselves out of the direct relegation line of fire with a points. How do you see this one playing out?  Yeah, exactly like that. I can't really pick a winner here. Although like just on paper. It would be crucial for Mark to book to win with seen all the fixtures around them. But yeah food as we said before for definitely improved untouched under Stephen lighter and it's going to be a tough one for Marta book to win.  They yeah, they're in a crucial situation and go with the drool Elliott's would you agree or do you see an outcome in this fixture?  I can see first making it a lot of thought they're quite unlucky not to get all three points again only on the weekend magdeburg have been a fairly uninspiring side. So, yep, that's my prediction. They haven't our last game of matchday 31 last but not least is an hour. They ha spoken when the two sides met last time out was 2-1 win for balcombe. This is the 19th meeting between the two sides in the previous 18.  Come have 110 and in fact that unbeaten in their last eight, so I put a of optimism then Elliot that that baucom can get the job done.  Yeah, but bottom famously let them down. Yeah, I don't make winning the draw things looking good for for ourselves. But still the club has a minor injury Christ. It's a good eight thirteen players missing out for injury, which is quite good because the youngsters have been getting a chance and I've been playing well, but yeah, let's let's go for the stats and predictor bottom.  Trade but a side benefit. I mean it's a bit of a nothing much a guy can unfortunately two teams who are safe just playing for pride really but it will be good to see as kick on and finish a bit higher than night sure for sure Eva do share the same optimism for baucom win, or do you see something different? Well, it's really really difficult. I would love to  bring some joy to all the Balkan fans out there and say they're going to win bird. I talked to more words earlier and he said that we broke so many roles this season. I'm sure this will be one of them, but what we might hope for is plenty of Gold's because this game has an average of three goals per game, which is not that bad. Yeah.  It's really difficult. But I hope for balcombe sake it's going to be a win. Why don't you wait and see on that that concludes our preview of match day 31, we have to topic questions for the program today, but there were two pretty similarly. It has to be said it is all about the promotion. So we had one question from still Penguin at still penguin 3 and another from been Jack.  1871 that one is from Instagram. So they basically go along the lines of you know can paderborn catch up to homburg. And is there a chance that potentially partner born and hide in time and will include all neon despite the form could they displace harsh fell out of the playoff the top three entirely so either I'm going to start with you.  I couldn't could they could could Hamburg really be displaced. Well, maybe not completely. But if they continue to play that poorly they have been the past weeks. I definitely say that paderborn can beat them and can really challenge them for the second place and if it's going to continue like it is in the last couple of weeks.  I'd say it will end up way because paderborn just because nobody expected that from them. They were coming up from the Talega last season to be in try to get this season and nobody expected anything of them except staying in the league and it seems like there's something they don't want to do they want to go up there. They like the team that says okay if you all of you don't want to go up and it's expected of you more or less.  Us has foul on your own urine for plenty of years already and they just don't have the pressure like the fence a oh, it would be great, but we won't be mad if it doesn't happen and that's different and at a humble again and at on your own because on your own once more more or less bottled their season, and that's why it can happen. But I wouldn't say that Heidenheim will have anything to do with it. Yeah, I'd say degree. I'm hesitant.  To say I think more than anything part of born will do it. I think they can do it and I think they will finish second if form persisting it makes this week's game and of course, they will play each other Hamburg and part of born later on in the seas and kind of thing much day 33, so it makes for a really interesting crescendos to the season. I'm not sure how you see it Elliot's do seem to think that part of board are going to do it. They'll  finish second and Hamburg will slip out or even further with hostile miss out altogether.  Yeah. No, I agree. I think probably really could make it here. I mean when it comes down to it, they think for when it matters for and up the last five playing good football. They're playing bielefeld. So easy three points and coming as well. See ya. It could have bugs sit down to third with them. I'd probably ask no. Yep. I would like to see Hamburg to talk god.  Great, right interesting game for the neutral but no credit right to do partner born have come up and exceeded all expectations really quite like whole shankill two years back, but I would back them to go one better than Keel and the approach is really and you just said they deserve it the way they're playing nice attractive expensive football. Exactly one for the eye test. That is for certain that concludes our program we  Thank you for joining us on on a lovely evening here in Adelaide or wherever you're listening to it around the world will be back next week. Of course looking back at all the action from Match Day 31 and looking ahead at Match Day 32 from myself Matthew Carriage Eva and Elliott's we hope you enjoy your weekend of swatter Bundesliga football and we'll see you next time.  the fastest back home  I do not multitasking getting and our staff to go.

spotify:episode:2RgjUcbtsCBDtqKdQ5JVbE	Is a little bloody.  Bloody I did not expect to feel the least bit squeamish Readiness and like if I'm being honest, I'm a little grossed out right now. There's often reasons why we don't eat certain foods anymore. You know, it's a small bird without a lot of meat in a very very distinct taste and texture that's not going to appeal to everybody that small bird.  the pigeon  from gimlet media. This is surprisingly awesome. I'm Adam Davidson this week. We are very excited to be joined by John muallem. He's a colleague of mine at the New York Times magazine. He's known for writing these beautiful SAS stick long-form stories about I guess your big topic is the relationship between animals and human beings. Is that fair John? I think that's her you wrote a beautiful book Wild Ones you've reported for Radiolab This American Life and  John when we called you and said, hey we want you to find something that's surprisingly awesome you instantly it was like the answer was just sitting there waiting for us to call. That's what I said Thank God someone is finally gonna let me talk about pigeons pigeons. They are the perfect surprisingly awesome topic. They're all around us all the time and we barely notice them at all except to be annoyed by them. But today we're going to talk about how pigeons are surprisingly.  Lee awesome, what do you heard at the very beginning of the show that was us eating a pigeon or a squab as it's called when it's served in fancy restaurants and our guide Sarah Lomond. She's a cook and a historian. She told us today. We are doing a recipe from actually the French restaurant Delmonico's this recipe or this menu item pigeon with green peas is what it was called was on their very first menu, which was published in the 1830s there like the original French restaurant in New York City.  To me. Yeah, it's got this particular coloring that I associate with game. I like it. I really like that. You hate it almost wallet. I'm going to swallow it. So how did this bird go from being a dish served at some of the fanciest restaurants to something Americans pretty much never eat to find out we went to where you're much more likely to find a dead pigeon now not on the table, but on a dirty Street Corner we went there to meet a pigeon.  Pert named Colin Jarrell Mac. I'm an associate professor of sociology and Environmental Studies at NYU. And as I understand it we're literally standing in the place that changed your life. It did. Colin was a young sociology grad student with a dream. He wanted to be just like his hero Jane Jacobs he wanted to do exactly what she had done sit around the streets of Greenwich Village in New York and just count people watch people see how they interact with the  In environment, but he didn't really know where to go and he sort of randomly Came Upon This spot father demos square and although I had been here many times. I was now officially a field worker. I was doing this for a class. I had a camera around my neck, and I had a notepad but it's February right? There's not actually that many people to observe. So what does he do? He starts taking notes on whatever you can find like this concrete slab. It's not even actual statue. It's just a concrete slab in the middle of the park with a dedication to  Father Dimo on it Eileen and I said, let me write down the inscription here. And as I leaned in this green white fecal matter, you know didn't land right on my head but glanced off my forehead, you know, and it's like I literally a pigeon pooped on him and just like when that Apple fell on Newton Collins suddenly saw the world for what it was this block that he had chosen. It didn't actually have any people to watch but it did have public three to four hundred pigeons just in this tiny little Park where there was no people  Like Jesus that's a lot of pigeons here and in the course of that day and the next day and the day after the only people that really came and lingered were people that came in to feed the pigeons. You know, John, I grew up just a few blocks from father demos square and I spent all of high school working right across the street at the Minetta Lane theater, and I don't remember other than going with you and Colin ever actually walking in on purpose to Father the most Square my whole childhood. It was such a nasty place.  And so right at the time that Colin started this project there was this movement to spruce up father demos Square maybe put in some new benches put in a fountain make it a place that people actually want to enter and then I started going to these public comment periods in the community board meetings and everybody was talking about the pigeons. It was really surprising they hated them and so they would say what are we going to do about the pigeons? And what do we do about the homeless people and they talked about pigeons and homeless people  In the same way this made Colin realize that pigeons completely influence the feel of a place everyone dealt with them in New York, but never really gave them any serious thought so he decided he was going to Jane Jacobs the crap out of them. He spent years observing the pigeons and father game of square and in other cities around the world, he wrote a book the global pigeon and he discovered that how pigeons were treated right here in New York. Is this kind of flying trash that gets in our way. That is not how we always thought about pigeons and  Fact for most of human history, we love them. They were domesticated that we think as long as 5,000 years ago the first bird to be domesticated one of the first five animals to be domesticated and so they were bred as a food source also, of course because they can find their way home from somewhere. They've never been up to a thousand miles away. So they were the first Messengers before, you know, telegraph's what have you so that's what brought them everywhere pigeons delivered the news of the first Olympic Games, you know, the original ones like yeah in ancient Greece.  Is Con use them to send messages throughout his Empire since the time of the Pharaohs pigeons had played a role in sending messages, especially when there was a war they were the internet the telegram the telephone of their day. In fact, we know that if we don't tell you the story of one very famous wartime pigeon. We are going to get letters right Cher Ami Cher Ami was a pigeon enlisted in the Army in World War 1. This is like the Rambo of pigeons a lot of people credit this bird with  being a hundred ninety four American lives after a unit was separated from its division Behind Enemy Lines Cher Ami brought a message and while I was doing so it was actually shot in the chest when it arrived back at it scoop its leg was dangling off its body and I think this demonstrates the degree to which pigeons were exalted Legend has it that Jeremy's handlers made him a little Peg Leg to replace the leg that was shot off and he was awarded the Croix De Guerre by the French for his service. You can actually see  Jeremy's little taxidermied body in the Smithsonian and it wasn't just that one pigeon or that we thought of pigeons as useful. We thought they were beautiful in the late 19th century pigeon fancying breeding and admiring the birds like we do today with the Westminster dog show it became this fashionable upper-class hobby Rich dignified ladies from the Upper East Side would go to the park with their Maids lugging bags of seeds for them just to feed the pigeons and bankers on Wall Street would go out on their lunch break.  Brakes and buy seed from vendors just to feed the pigeons and we ate them a lot. They were like chicken is today people in cities kept coops full of pigeons on their roofs. They were small. So if you had to feed a whole family, maybe you'd go up and grab three or four to cook dinner pigeons were so useful. There are some versatile. They were like the Swiss Army knives of birds from Linea humans really loved pigeons Millennia and seriously Adam were a pretty fickle species. I think the list of things that humans have consistently loved for millennia.  Not very long. It's like sex fire maybe flowers refreshing summer breezes. Here's our pigeon guy calling again. And actually if you read the Origin of Species, you will notice that the first 70 to 85 pages is all about pigeon breeds. Darwin used pigeons, not only because they were strategic as far as explaining natural selection through artificial selection, but because pigeons were so popular at the time breeding pigeons were so popular and when he first wrote up the book his editor sent it off to some prominent.  People and they're like, you know, you should just keep that part about pigeons because everybody loves pigeons and it'll make a great coffee table book. And that was that was the actual suggestion was just scrap the whole Evolution. So up until recently that was our relationship with pigeons everyone including Darwin's editors wanted more of them. So what happened basically technology happened we didn't need pigeons for communication anymore because we invented the telegraph and we figured out how to breed chickens really well, so they produce much more meat faster, so we didn't need to  Pigeons anymore either with the rise of industrial agriculture. We didn't really need their poop as fertilizer anymore either. And so that's when the love affair between our two species ended somewhere in the middle of the 20th century. And what happened is kind of what happens at the end of a lot of love affairs you get your needs met some other way and you push the person away and pretty soon. You're like not only do I not need you anymore. Actually now that I think about it, you're kind of gross and like in this case. Anyway, you literally walk around eating garbage making lots of poop.  And then it's not just indifference There's an actual pigeon backlash and it happens fast. Colin told us about this episode in the 1960s. We're two New Yorkers died within a week of each other of meningitis. Everyone was desperately trying to pinpoint the cause and a commissioner from the Department of Health use some pretty shaky evidence to say, oh those two people died because of pigeon poop He whipped up a whole lot of pigeon Panic about meningitis, it grows in Pigeon feces. And so he said, I think they got it from being  Suppose the pigeon feces and five million, you know over five million people are at risk in all five boroughs and he even give this outrageous quote. Like there's no doubt that people are at threat of dying because other you know, the so that others can have the pleasure of feeding pigeons and in the wake of this a New York City Parks commissioner held a press conference in Bryant Park. His name was Thomas hoving you may have heard of him. He later went on to run the Metropolitan Museum of Art. This guy's basically an embodiment of respectable New York Society. He's a kind of guy.  Guy who in the olden days might have been a high-class pigeon fancier, but he gave pigeons a label that to this day. They have been unable to shake he held a press conference in Bryant Park because Bryant Park at the time was kissing to be very derelict in full of deviant people and behaviors when he said explicitly his targets were Winos homosexuals, right and pigeons. Yeah, and so he lumping together and he said the Winos as soon as they're dried out. They make a beeline from Bellevue the homos make  Is that people and he said and then there's the pigeons I call them rats with wings if you actually analyze newspaper articles for this phrase. You just see it like spread like wildfire and then of course right Stardust Memories and it's this one seen a pigeon flies into Woody Allen's apartment where he's with his girlfriend and she says, oh, it's beautiful. He says, no, they're not the rats with wings.  That's what he Allen's films Stardust Memories from 1980. And from that point on it's codified as common sense. That's what pigeons are rats with wings. This is the point of no return. It's an act of aggression. There's no recovering from its game over. It's like human Carlton Fisk hitting a home run to defeat pigeon Cincinnati Reds in the World Series. The amazing thing to me is that actually people will say it to me as if they invented this idea or thought of like, you know, what I call pigeons. I call them rats with wings and Mike.  Really, huh? Wow. I hadn't heard that one before the problem is just because we hate them. It doesn't mean that the pigeons go away. It's too late the pigeons out of the bag and because they're super adaptive Birds. They just keep thriving and spreading they're everywhere now except Antarctica. And remember these birds are not native to America. They're not native to Paris or London. They're from the Middle East and the Mediterranean region. We brought them wherever we went. We bred them to be completely dependent on  On us to be used to taking food from us. And now that the love affair is over. They become feral John. I did not actually know what the word feral meant. I just thought I meant like a nasty wild animal, but I learned that it means an animal that lives in the wild but which is descended from domesticated animals. I did not know that I knew that but I mean don't sweat it out. I'm sure there's lots of credit default swap terminology that you know that I don't know. But anyway what it means that pigeons are feral. It means that every pigeon you  On the street is actually descended from a pigeon that was once domesticated. So every pigeons great-great-great great-great-great grandmother going all the way back. All those grates was basically a farm animal. So the pigeon over my apartment right now might be descended from some great racer who saved my great-great-great-great grandfather in the Civil War. I feel like there's some newspaper column to be written where someone tracks down the descendant of Cheramie living on the streets destitute New York. I feel like that that might want to pull it to her and the pigeons  and they're just like around like wait people. We're just trying to live the life that you set up for us. Of course, we don't see it. That way pigeons don't even have the decency for instance to like live in a tree right because of their their natural inclination for their originally from these Rocky Ledges and cliffs. They spend more of their time mating defecating living and dying on the spaces. We've determined to be only for us literally the sidewalks. They sit on benches there on the cornice of your of your apartment Window. And so  It's by virtue of being out of place right? I'm not being with a supposed to be why are these homeless people sleeping on the bench and you might not be able to tell but Collins really angry about this actually he has this righteous indignation that I'm starting to share that we have a responsibility to pigeons and have to say standing there and talking to Colin. We were learning more about pigeons in my respect and affection for those birds. It kept increasing but sort of as a corollary my respective human beings just kept decreasing plunging. Really, I mean it got really dark.  Thinking about what kind of creatures are we that we kind of just trembled around the earth dragging all these things with us and then just forgetting about them and letting them fend for themselves and then calling them gross and hating them and resenting them for it. Let's let's help redeem your sense of humanity and to do so we talked to a guy who has not lost that beautiful relationship with pigeons that we all once had coming up after the break. We talked to a man who spends time with pigeons every day a man who has a stack of pigeon magazines next to his  Each are a man who built a pigeon coop in his backyard the the red bed.

We're at the part of the show where we need to go inside the Lion's Den into the coop.  You just kept so you were home. I just want to explain what just happened because to me it was amazing. You grabbed a flying bird out of the air with your hands. Then you are like checking its wings. You have looking at the ways feeling how it had a body feels. Yeah, how'd it feel good. That's that's a daughter right there out of a bird that one 30,000. This is Steve Rogers. He's a retired pipe welder Born and Raised on Staten Island still living there and his whole life centers around racing pigeons. So I want to set you up with a visual for this next piece of tape. We're entering what basically looks  A double-wide garden shed, but a pretty fancy one. It's about a full story tall. It has vinyl siding that matches the main house. There's a lot of people in Manhattan who would kill to live in something this big it's divided into these smaller compartments to keep the babies away from the grown-ups. It's well-lit and surprisingly clean. There's not too much poop. They're considering the first thing you see when you walk in is a wall full of pigeons and you know, like at a carnival when you throw a ring around a bottle and you win a stuffed animal at all.  Stuffed animals are just in that giant wall on shelves behind you. That's what the pigeons were like until we show up.  Bet and the crazy thing was is that Steve just kind of kept casually chatting with us like birds would whizzed past his head. He literally snatched a couple out of the air as they were just flying around all around us and he just kind of turn it over and be like as you can see on this bird. He was so calm and meanwhile, I was literally like coward behind your big puffy jacket trying to stay low so I didn't get hit in the head by a pigeon. I gotta say however scared. I was I was not as scared as you which made me feel slightly less ashamed. I'm glad to be able to provide that service for you. I  Uh, she ate it and you pointed out it's like someone being on one of those game shows where they put a contestant in a glass booth and there's a blower and all this money swirling around them, except. Yeah instead of money. It's pigeons and you don't want to touch them at all. Although to Steve to be fair. Those pigeons are money. It costs a lot to take care of the birds Steve's Coop alone costs about $30,000 to build then there's feeding them really well. He is a very special mix and giving them medicine the pigeons and Steve scoop.  Are the same kind of pigeons at Street pigeons same species same genus same genetics, but they're not from the street and you can tell that instantly when you see them. They're just cleaner healthier a street pigeon might live for two years. Steve's birds can live for a decade or more because these birds are specially bred. They're really expensive. These are the freezes over here.  These are the mothers and fathers that hand down there. I just I just paid a grand for her 50 actually 50 Steve points out. It's the same as horse racing you get a bird. That's a winner. It's Babies are worth a lot. Even it's grandkids the most expensive racing pigeon in the world sold for three hundred and ten thousand dollars back in 2013. It was named bolt as in Hussein bolt a Chinese businessman bought it a pigeon racing in the US has been on the decline since World War Two there's about half as many people racing pigeons.  Now is there were back then but internationally, there's still a lot of money in Pigeon Racing in the Middle East and China, but just because these birds cost a lot of money doesn't mean they're worth anything same as Horses. I mean, you can't you can't you buy a horse for four million dollars. You don't know if they could run for feet because die on you in a friggin stall and how did you get into this? It's a I think it's a friggin birth defect. I swear to God I had them what my I got a friend of mines father had them and he found an old Coupe and up in the woods.  We took it apart and brought it into a lot by his house and that's how we started, you know, and I'm still doing it. How old are you 12? Do you do you name them at all? No, I don't want to be friends with him. I got a I got a friend and I didn't erase them. It's helpful to understand how Pigeon Racing actually works. So he's training his pigeons all the time to come back to their Coop The Coop they live in right and then when it's time for a race, he and a bunch of other guys in his region who  Also, raise pigeons, they'll load their Birds onto a truck and the truck drives them hundreds of miles away to a place like Cadiz. Oh Ohio or Greenfield Indiana these towns with race stations in them then all at once all the pigeons are like go and they start flying really fast as fast as I can back to their home Coop and this is how it's different from horse racing. They all have the same starting line. But each pigeons Finishing Line is a little different. Each pigeon is racing to its Coop and  Like all the pigeon Racers I said the exact distance measured from the racing station to his particular Coop outside his house and each pigeon has a band around its leg that checks it in as it finishes the race. It's all computerized now. It's like a freaking easy pissed. So have you won? Yeah, I do. All right. Yeah, and what do you win money? What do you think? What's the best you've done? I don't want to say all right tens of thousands. Oh, yeah. Are you ahead and pigeons never had a budget? Yeah.  You never had. It's like playing cards and you just kind of say even you hope and it was clear when we were in the coop with Steve. It's not like these are his pets. They're just his hobby. They serve a purpose. It's more like they were like cars. He was fixing up or model trains. He likes to build he really did seem attached to them as like living beings and hey parents and animal lovers. You might want to dip the volume just for a few seconds for the next piece of information Steve told us that when a bird  From someone else's Cooper Street Pigeon wanders into his Coupe. He just Rings its neck. He doesn't know where those birds have been they could get his bird sick. And what Steve does by the way is just one type of pigeon competition. There's also performance pigeons the same pigeons that bread for a whole other set of skills. There are tumblers which are pigeons that compete based on their ability to do backflips while they're flying there's rollers which are pigeons that are better at forward flip. There's tipplers. These guys are my  Everett these are endurance pigeons. So you've got Steve's pigeons, which might raise for eight or nine hours to go from Ohio back to his Coupe in Staten Island, but tipplers can fly nonstop for almost a full day. What? Why do you think you're into it? What do you guys just I just love it. I love to I love to race. I love to I love the action. It's like you say it's like if you're if you really like you want to play cards for money or you want to chase women or whatever you want to do you do and you will and you enjoy it, you know, John it was right about this trip to stop.  Island that I really felt my feelings about pigeons changing and when we started this you are already pretty strongly on the pigeon train, right you you were like in pigeons and I started out pretty grossed out by them. I would say I felt solidarity with pigeons and I held them in high esteem and that only got stronger but for me I started seeing them as this Noble thing and I start buying the argument that we human beings show them some responsibility. And so I got in my head how excited I was to go back home.  Um see the pigeons are my neighborhood in a whole new way. I got this really specific idea. I went to a pet store. I bought some birdseed because we were told along the way don't feed pigeons bread. That's not good for them. I got a big sack of it. I was going to pick up my son Ash go to the park with him and we'd sit on a bench and just feed the pigeons and watch them people told me if you watch pigeons long enough, you'll realize each one has its own personality. There are funny ones and stupid ones and aggressive ones and really shy.  One's a nervous ones a nice ones. I thought oh, it'll be just like in Mary Poppins. We're going to have this glorious pigeon adventure together.  top top top  And then we talked to a man who told me to cut it out. How do I pronounce your name? Hawk? Laka laka. Yeah. I mean the whole time I was in New York with you guys. I kept saying we have to call Daniel hog Walker naugle, and I think maybe you guys thought I was making him up or something where you sort of patronize me and sort of say his name one way or another way. But this guy this is a real guy Daniel hog Walker naugle, he's sort of the dean.  Of urban pigeon science and he is the Dream Crusher for you Adam when it comes to your fantasy of feeding pigeons in the park. He's got a really long history with pigeons and it goes back all the way to when he was in something called The Pigeon service in the Swiss Army where they trained pigeons to send messages just like Cher Ami, you just said that the Swiss Army still had a pigeon service when you were starting out. It was about 15 years ago. They stopped it in the 1980s Daniel hog Walker. Naco was a newly minted PhD in.  Biology in Basel Switzerland and the city was experiencing this huge problem a pigeon problem like it a lot of cities there was a core group of elderly folks that were feeding pigeons all the time and not just casually feeding them like at lunch a few crumbs, but in a dedicated routine way, they would have bags and bags of seeds and they'd be tending entire flocks and this really kind of disrupted the entire pigeon ecosystem. This pigeons can recognize a regular feeder recognize the person's face.  Blocks away and then the bird will just follow that person to wherever they normally get fed. These people thought they were doing a great thing. But this new food source meant that Boswell's pigeon population was exploding it reached 25,000 Birds. There were so many birds. They were living in slum, like conditions all crowded up getting diseases. Did you solve the pigeon problem of Basel the over population? Of course, it's not quite possible to solve it. Definitely of lip butter.  We could cause a reduction of the population for more than half Daniel started trying to explain to people when you feed the pigeons. They have way too much time on their hands because they're barely spending any time looking for food and when pigeons have too much time on their hands you wind up with a lot more pigeons because if you don't control the food source pigeons just keep breathing. They don't have a breeding season. They just do it all the time.  Only takes like three or four weeks for a pigeon to go from being a baby to being able to have babies themselves. And this by the way is something we bred into them because we used to love pigeons so much. We wanted them to reproduce as fast as possible and as another aside, you know, how you never see baby pigeons actually until I went into Steve Rogers Coupe. I had never seen a baby pigeon. They're kind of weird looking that's because they grow really quickly. They don't actually leave their nests until they're fully formed.  It's yeah, and so if you go into a pigeon coop, you can actually see what looks like an adult pigeon sitting on top of what looks like another adult pigeon. It's messed up and that adult pigeon sitting on that almost an adult pigeon could be male or female moms and dads take turn keeping their babies warm and moms and dads mate for life incredibly heartwarming, I think but not to the city of Basel. They were really worried that these birds could transmit diseases to humans. They were pooping on all the public buildings all the public.  Statues and fountains Sedalia launched what he called a pigeon action. It was basically an education campaign to tell everyone please stop feeding the pigeons. You think that you're helping but actually this isn't good for us or for the birds. It was actually kind of cruel. You do not do anything good for a Peyton if you feed them because they they become lazy and our couch potato that you have a less I could health condition.  How can a person who works for food? If they are fact every day at the same point they don't fly out and they don't have a good body condition that they have a lot of time for reproduction. That's the problem. It's not good for the birds. We live near a big Park and there's some people who feed the pigeons and my son is four years old and you know, like a four year old kids. He loves running.  Through the pigeons and making them fly away and I would discourage him from running into the pigeons. I felt like it wasn't nice but you're actually saying that my son is doing the right thing for the pigeons and the person feeding them is doing the wrong thing all over the world children around through pigeon flocks.  And that's good for them that give that's like taking them to the gym. It's gives the measure sighs. So where does that leave us? We spent this whole episode and I'm learning to appreciate pigeons. What do we do with that appreciation? Yeah. That was my question and Daniel hug Walker Naco basically said if you learn to love them let them go you can admire them from a distance, but they are at their best. Now if we let them lead lives as wild as possible what Daniel is arguing is we have to fully break up with pigeons we  Get to the point where if we show up at a park and they're there we both just do our own thing now. It's weird about it. There are no hard feelings a respectful break up real mature. Don't throw them a pizza crust. Just let the birds go back to being independent animals. I think it was probably the pigeon scientist Dionne Warwick who explain this best. She said if you see me walking down the street and I start to cry each time.

spotify:episode:2Kg0p7ppcrwKkTsbxYSKCY	Hey guys is Peter Frey and welcome to the living with hope podcast and Daily Devotional where we dig into God's word and explore what it means to live with. Hope in Jesus. We come today to the second half of Paul's prayer in Ephesians 1 15 through 23 and yesterday's podcast. We explored the first half of this where Paul prays that we would have a greater knowledge of God and a greater.  Realization of the hope that is ours in Christ Jesus and here in this second half beginning in verse 19 Paul's going to pray for a greater experience of the power of the Resurrection in the Our Lives as Believers in Jesus. So before we jump into this passage and read these words, I want us to pray together that the spirit would Open the Eyes of our hearts that we would see his truth and be  Change by its oh Father lead us as we read your word today.  Would you quiet our hearts submits the busyness that might lie ahead of us?   And give us the ability to rest in your presence and pray that your spirit would open our eyes that we would have ears to hear and hearts to understand and that we might be changed by the glories of your gospel. We pray in Jesus name. Amen. Ephesians 1. I'm going to start in verse 15 and read this whole prayer if Visions one verses 15 through  3 for this reason because I have heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love toward all the saints. I do not cease to give thanks for you remembering you and my prayers that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ. The father of Glory may give you a spirit of wisdom and of Revelation in the knowledge of him having the eyes of your hearts enlightened that you may know. What is the hope to which he has called you and what are the riches of his glorious inheritance in the  the Saints and what is the immeasurable greatness of his power toward us who believe according to the working of his great might that he worked in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the Heavenly places far above all Rule and authority and power and dominion and above every name that is named not only in this age, but also in the one to come and he put all things under his feet and gave  Them as head over all things to the church, which is his body the fullness of him who fills all in all.  I want you to imagine that a friend of yours gave you a new computer. They said hey, this is a top-of-the-line machine. It's got the fastest processor and the greatest graphics card and you don't even know what those things are. But you're like, this is awesome. And you open the box and you get out the computer and there's no power cord in the Box. You ask your friend about it and say hey, do you know where the power cord is and  I said yeah, it's kind of unfortunate. The company didn't make a power cord for this computer. It's got all the features you might need though. And you might say well that's isn't that kind of pointless to have all the features but not have the power that's similar to what Paul says in First Corinthians 15 when he says that unless Christ has risen from the dead.  Ed your faith the Christian faith is useless. It's in vain. It's empty unless Christ has risen from the dead you see the power behind the Christian Life the power behind having a knowledge of God and a realization of Hope is the power of the resurrection and that's what Paul prays that we would experience in our lives. He says in verse 19  That you would know this is his prayer that you would know. What is the immeasurable greatness of God's power toward those who believe and then Paul roots that power into things as this passage goes on. It's almost as if Paul breaks out of prayer mode and goes into praise mode, which I think is something that we should develop the discipline in our lives that our prayer life should lead us into Praise of who  Jesus is and that's what Paul does at the end of this passage. He grounds the prayer that we would know the power of the Resurrection into realities. Now, the first is that Christ is has the power over the grave. They Christ has risen from the dead and that that's what he says according to the working of his great might when he raised Christ from the dead and then he grounds it in something else. Not only the power of Christ over the dead but the position of  Christ over everything you see it says that God seated Christ at his right hand. That's the position of power that Christ is seated at the right hand of God and he has power over everything and not only that but the his name is the name over everything and then we see at the end of this passage and important truth that helps us as we think about our experience of the power of the Resurrection in our lives today.  It says that Christ has been given as the head of the church to the body and he has been given to us to be the fullness of him who fills all in all in the other words that Christ is given to the church as a life-giving source for the church. And so as we think about where Jesus is today that he seated at the right hand of God that his name is the name that is above every other name.  He is supreme over all and that he has power over the grave. We see the truth that that power isn't simply an abstract reality about the future but it's a present reality for the church that Christ is positioned as the head of the church in order that we might experience his resurrection power in our lives today. And that's what Paul prays for for the church in Ephesus, and I think we should pray for  Or in our lives today that we would know the immeasurable greatness of the power of God that he is working. Not just that he worked when he crate raised for Christ from the dead and not just that he will work when he raises us from the dead but that he is working out in the church today you might say so how is the resurrection power at work in our lives? Well, it's it's the power behind the  In life, you see hope is useless without the power of God and what the power of God in through the resurrection of Jesus from the dead does is it comes and it vitalizes the Christian Life? It's the power behind our joy. It's the power behind our faithfulness. It's the power behind our love the power of Jesus raising from the dead is the power behind your spiritual life.  Life today one resource that has been extremely helpful for me in the past year is a book that I picked up. I think I got it on Amazon or I'm not quite sure where I got it. It is by Douglas McKinley and it is a Book of Prayers called every moment. Holy and it walks through a series of prayers for different moments in.  Day, and there's a prayer that I have often started my day with called a ritual for morning coffee. And one of the things that I found this prayer helpful for as I start my day with a cup of coffee is it reminds me that Jesus wants to work out the power of Rhett the resurrection in my life today and it gives some specifics as it prays for Jesus to be at work in us. So I'm going to  to end our podcast with this prayer today, but I encourage you to continue to meditate on the Paul's words that we would have a deeper knowledge of God a greater realization of Hope and a greater experience the power of the Resurrection in our lives today.  Meet me. Oh Christ in the Stillness of morning Move Me O Spirit to quiet my heart men Me O Father from yesterday's harms from the discords of yesterday. Resurrect my piece from the discouragements of yesterday resurrect My Hope from the weariness of yesterday. Resurrect my strength from the doubts of yesterday. Resurrect my faith.  From the wounds of yesterday resurrect my love. Let me enter this new day awake of my need and awake to your grace O Lord. Amen.	Exploring the second half of Paul's prayer in Ephesians 1:15-23, we see that the power behind the Christian life and hope is rooted in the resurrection of Jesus!

What the fuck but then the real cheese, but the crazy the crazy part about all of that to of Cassie and Diddy and then the guy that she's without  Alex fine because his name not be any that Alex fine, babe. Alex fine, bitch, like the crazy thing with that is he was his trainer like he was a trainer that did he hired on to train her. That's what I was going to bring up. Okay. I saw that my God, you think that that's the truth. Listen. She says that they didn't have any type of involvement when she and Diddy were together and listen if that's what she says if that's what she says was.  On then shit. I it is what it is. But whoa, May that had to be crushing for did he like this nigga had the born twice. He had two more than twice in less than two miles. Okay, I'll get I'll give him that you had the more than twice but bitch, you know, hold on. What we not going to do is have our hearts bleeding for my Kono. See you misread what I said I said I said he was in morning. I didn't say I feel sorry for his ass.  Listen, I did not know because there's a lot of there's a lot of people out there and do feel sorry for him because he posted that picture and she hit the WAP like got you bitch did not today and everybody's Hearts was bleeding like oh, oh, no, he he got every bit of what he deserved because the thing is is I feel like you know did eat to me. He's like, he he's a person who will get involved in a relationship that much I'll give him he'll get him off with a  but when it comes to taking that actual factual goddamn leap, he does not do it and and my thing is, you know, I dated nobody and a hot little minute but I feel like and this is always been where my mind is if you and I are dating and we both have openly talked about being married getting married like things like that and that that's the end goal like my nigga if you ain't discuss this  It thoroughly with me like said something serious and made some type of serious move towards it like within a year. I think, you know within a year. I think you know if you want to marry somebody but if you ain't hit that proposal in like to it Hey, listen, what are we doing? What are we doing? Because I'm not going to be one of those people that's in a relationship for five seven years and then you're like, oh shit. It's been a goddamn decade. Let me go get me go to Jared's real quick and see.  What they pop what they talking about, like what if they do get if they do that because you get a lot of these menu you three five years seven years into a relationship everybody's comfortable and the thing that they gonna hit you with the moment you bring it up why we gotta why we gotta do anything while we gotta change up what we got we good how we are you rushing to hit you why are you rushing stuff? Right this shit? So beautiful, you know, this is beautiful what we got and you you want to fuck it up.  Why you why you wanted, you know, bring legal we know on a man with again. So we gonna do because this is because this is this deserves the man out because this how dumb they said, you know, we damn near married already yy-you want to bring the legal stuff into it. We are ready. You know, we've been together for 10 years already. So why why we bitch girl listen, like you say it don't take nothing it own take a whole day to recognize sunshine. I don't  How mother I'll care how many people have been together for 15 years. I just knew I knew when she hit that now you're Martin knew she was the one for me bitch. It takes someone no more and a year is generous is very General within yeah, you know within six months whether you want to be with someone or you you can't tolerate them like for  Life at that point, I mean because if you're consistently scuse me, if you're consistently around someone you're talking to them consistently, you're seeing them you guys even live together fucking know you fucking absolutely fucking and that that there's there's not too many variations of that that's going to happen from that point forward. So, you know within that six months like you know, why it's not die, you know younger boots  Any younger Jagged Edge already? I told your stupid ass. Come on younger. We - Well - well, that's it. So I go ahead. I'm sorry. No. No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. No, I was just I was just saying I feel like 10 years if Kim was still alive. Oh bitch. He'd still be string Cassie along. Yeah, and you know, and I kind of sometimes I wonder.  Her because you know when you think about it, we never saw Kim with anybody after did he like unless she just did shit on the loski like we might become her with any and so I don't know if it was a situation where she just kept her shit hidden or he made her feel guilty about being with somebody or she could have just been so in love that she just didn't really see it for everybody else after him. But either way, I know I'm sorry. Go ahead. No, I keep interrupting you going no. No, no.  You're fine. I promise II just I just wonder and then you know, I think that probably forecasting the ultimate slap in the face in that situation what mean, you know, of course, he's gonna mourn Kim because that's the mother of his kids. But you know to have to repeatedly hear him say or read him say this is my soulmate the Des degrade. This is the you know, this was the Queen the one you know, and I'm like, but they have a she was such a queen and  You wanted your soulmate one nigga, like what like what boom exactly so did all that shit you talking? It's just shit girl. That's it is just shit. Like I honestly think and he was probably telling Kim like, you know, whoever comes in my life, you know, they're not going to Trump you, you know, you love my life and blah blah blah, but she was probably cool with it because she like I ain't gonna cause no waves, you know, I'm living I'm living good cinema.  I'm chilling and I have actually two friends that got together and you know, they were together for years and years and everybody knew of them as a couple and everyone respected them as a couple and mainly because they respected each of them individually and you know, they broke up, you know, unfortunately shit happens whatever so they break up and  and dudes they are afraid to approach my homegirl because they like nah, you-you-you so-and-so ex-girl. I can't I can't do that. I can't do that. So essentially that maybe what happened with Diddy and right or why Kim wasn't dating nobody because they probably looking at that like nah, you know, Diddy. I can't I can't I can't come in on Diddy territory and blah blah blah, so he's probably cock-blocking but not  On purpose and you know type and you know to one of the things I really can't stand about Diddy liking his is in his, you know relationships from what I've seen is he's the old Shoulda Coulda Woulda ass nigga like, you know, like once it's over and done somebody because okay. So let's take for example with Cassie. He posted a little weak ass picture, you know on his Instagram how much he loved her and then with Kim Porter, you know, she had to pass away for you to openly discuss the  fact that you feel she was your soul mate and she was a queen like did you tell her this before she passed away at any point like, you know, like so maybe she was waiting for that but then G even with Jennifer Lopez, he was like because you remember he did the song I Need a Girl and he was like damn. I wish you would have my child, you know, so you right you right ouch, but you but you wouldn't want to Jennifer. Listen Jennifer got the fuck on and she ain't dated a nigga since baby.  Listen when she is the queen of when the are you got to get the fuck up on out of there when you can't get shit right with the brothers get you a other goddamn it Jennifer Lopez caste off shirt t-shirt when you can't get shit right with the brothers nigga get you another fuck these niggas like teens planner always reminiscing.  What he could and should have did like Diddy you like 50 how the city and did he close to 50? I think so. Yeah, he too fucking basically. He too fucking old to be acting the way he is he acting? Sometimes he his Antics are really reminiscent of somebody like like his son Quincy. Like I can see Quincy Finance doing some stupid shit you to bunch of women. I could totally see him doing it, but that would come that would go a long with his age though. It would make sense for  Negative be running around. Look, hold on. Let me put a pin in that and that is a that's a fine. Goddamn young man. I don't normally do the the pretty niggas like I did one, you know you you know that one, but I normally don't do the super super like that pretty but listen that young man would make up. I think we got another stop on the train. Listen, you can be all.  The cream and that chocolate scenario. Okay, because baby Quincy Brown listen, I would like that nigga from the top of his motherfucking head down to his toenail bitch. I would give him a whole ass pedicure with my mouth we talked about this. Have you ever licked the guys toes before I have this  Peace to amaze me every single question that I feel like oh this gonna be a no-show it listed at this if it's on his body bitch has done been in my mouth before. Yeah. Okay. It's the guy that I did it to he was so he even said what the fuck yo like  He's done. Fuck it. Like he was like, I don't even want to say that the shit fell good. Just don't do that. Shit. All right, I freaked me out. I didn't know where you was golf with this. He said I thought you just, you know reverse cowgirl. That's so old. I was reverse cowgirl in and just getting it in and I bent over and he was like, I thought you was trying to give me a better view at ass and he was like I felt like going  But you know what I get it I fucking get it. Sometimes you gotta just go with the go where the mood tonight I get caught in the moment way too much bitch ABS getting caught in the moment has had somebody at whole ass in my mouth some feet in my mouth Agape snowball and swapping come with bitches and shit. Listen, you gotta Just go with it. You just gotta go with it. Oh, man, I would you get me off track.  They're okay. Sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but somebody did he know he was talking about the choo-choo train stopping for Quincy to pick a bus and that young man would have me popping some Viagra pills bitch. I need to get my heart. I need my erection to be long and strong for that nigga. Okay, absolutely. Absolutely. And you know, it's crazy because I've heard like I have, you know friends who do like a lot of different stuff like in the industry and stuff and they always talk about how he's so  / humble like he's super nice. He would get this nice ass pussy the fuck shit like all you want me to punch your nipples like polite puss. That's just that's what we go. Give them polite puss, but you know what I'm going back to like, you know, like commitment and things like that. So and this definitely goes along with with Diddy and shit. So do you I don't know if I've ever had this discussion with you do you have  Like a ring size preference like so when when when let's just say trabant a proposes to us. I mean you bitch so go on that was reflex. I'm sorry girl the wall. So let's just say trabant a is ready to get down on his name. I had to make that rhyme bars because it was thank you, babe. All right, so he gets down on his  and he's ready to propose. How disappointed would you be if he got you a ring? That was maybe smaller than what you expected. Like. It was like really like it was a chip ice like very miniscule very like nothing to it or are you one of those people one of those young ladies who like you'll set up like a little Pinterest board so they get some some ideas or some hints on what it is that they need to be getting you when it is time for them to propose.  Now this is the thing that finger goes up and that us comes out you sick fuck shit fuck off because I feel like if we're headed towards that direction like we're in this point in our relationship where we're like, you know, what you you might be the motherfucking one. We're gonna go ring shopping and I'm going to show you the type of rings that I like. I'm going to give you my  My ring size we're going to try a few on take some pictures of how they looking on my hand and shit. And then from there young sir. You have a blueprint of what I like now. Should you Veer off that course and bring me a chip? You know, I'm not one time in our ring shopping. Did I did I go to chip out and be like, you know, I like this to like no I didn't I didn't I didn't I didn't you.  Deviate from the plan. I showed you what I like I'm simple. I'm very simple as it is. So if you can't afford the ring it's not time to propose and I know I'm going to get a lot of the pygmies girl ain't even about the ring. It ain't it's not grunts. Are you to you good day good take a nap with your bullshit brain and you'll obey it is so I'll turn your finger green. Don't take a nap. Go go go somewhere with your tattoo.  Bringing okay girl, it's not is definitely not all about the ring. You're absolutely right pygmies, but I feel like  If you act like I don't wear jewelry as it is and this is something that I am to wear every single day for the rest of my life can it please be something that I like right at the very fucking minimum that I like and the thing is guys always feel as though like when you say that you want a nice ring. They start you know, that guys don't ever have like a happy medium like that bitch ass or say, you know, I can only afford to do know they gotta be bitches.  Only I can only do five hundred but nah, nah, you gotta have that $200,000 ring bitch. It's a whole bunch of numbers in between 500 and 200,000 nigga follow on a more suitable workers 500 ain't it? If you gotta go on QVC and make them payment you could do that to listen just make sure to shit is real because I got it. I got a little sensitivity and I can't do it. I always it's always interesting watching the discussions like for  somebody who if a woman, you know is not into jewelry like that like they're just like yeah, it doesn't matter to me like, you know, you can get me a little band and I'll be cool. I'm not super into jewelry either but much like you I feel like if I got a type every day and look down at that motherfucker or I'm holding one of your uh glass kids or you know, I'm reaching for something at the grocery store retching. Come on Rich if I'm right.  Grocery store, I want to be able to look at my hand and be like God damn that nigga getting some pussy to look at my baby. Look at in some Supreme pristine pussy tonight because he did good that's what what I propose to I want to be able to after I get over the well if I ever get proposed to because yeah, it's Dixie's and bitch. It is Dixie's and fuck these niggas. But if I were to get proposed to I want to have the kind of ring that once I get over the shock and the all  All you know in the fact that you even asked in the first place. I want to be sitting in your lap with no panties on doing what I do baby. You did good. You did good. I'm swallowing the night Sir you live in my mouth as well, sir. I'm juggling them shit you did. Well you did with Anna making you breakfast in the morning. What absolute this throat knows no bounds if the ring is nice it knows.  No bound. That's that should go on a 2019 platter this situation set up with some of the silly shit to say on this motherfucker. Hey, but I honestly don't like it's a reminder as a constant reminder of  I I have some I have a token of my man's love he knows me enough to know that this is something that I would have liked and loved and he picked it out for me exactly. You know this this it would make me think about him in a good way. And you know, you didn't you didn't get something just to get something to shut me up. Yeah. I proposed to you you wanted a proposal and I propose. Hey.  If that's what you got to do just to propose it somebody then go ahead and put it off. Yeah, just just just go ahead and just let me be near let's just continue to Netflix and chill within this two years because at that two year mark Bitch, you got to fucking go because listen, I'm not finna sit up and leave a man if he don't proposing to you I listen, this is the thing. This is this is let me tell you let me explain let me explain my thing is this is II  II don't I don't do long relationships like it. Well I'ma say at this stage in my life because obviously I'm not married so I can't say you know, what should I got to ring bitch, you know, so I held out right but at this stage in my life bitch, I'm gonna be 40 next year. I ain't got time to play with you niggas. I am not trying to play you show me that you have interest. You Court me the way. I need to be courted you treat me show me that I have a reason to draw.  Up a little bit my alpha female ISM and let you leave let you be that nigga. Oh, yes. Okay. Okay. Okay. So so show me that you it's you know how to not only Port me the way I want to be courted that you know how to help me let the fences down so that I can trust you enough to lead us into wherever it is that we're going and then I need to also know that  you're listening that your understanding my likes and dislikes that those things matter to you. And then you need to be making a solid decision to me. It doesn't take five years to do that shit and and no Shades. It doesn't know shade to anybody that's interested in their 3 year 4 year 5 year mark, I'm it because a couple years ago being in a three year four year five year mark wouldn't have been a big deal. Like one of my longest relationship was a little bit over three years. So I okay I get it but at 38 fit to be 39 and six  It's gonna be 40 in a year and a half. I'm not fit to play with you. You either know what we fitting to do and know how we finna get down. You know, if I'm the type of woman that you want to be committed to it doesn't take you five years to figure that shit out, but we're not finna do no common law booked it like you can suck my dick or Earnest you can stop the darkness back y'all this is bad. It is back from Zach season.  Relationship was seven years and but I was about to say that was also when a bitch was like early 20s like together pretty much. So right we talked about marriage and I thought that that was going to be the person that I married eventually it wasn't nowhere on the table in my 20s at that time. Even when I was thinking back like no, I know that  Want to get married but you know, we're not going to get married until our 30s like we ain't ready for that shit right now, right? It's like it's a different mindset if you guys are younger and you've been together for some years that's fine. You need time to grow and come into yourself as a young adult and you know, even a an adult-adult. All right, but when you are, you know seasoned as fuck like we are we know what the fuck we want out of our partner and out of our helpmate exactly. I don't I don't need  A 10 years to sit and stew to decide whether or not I want to spend the rest of my life with you. I know what I want right now today. If I see a motherfucker that has those qualities. Let's go right what we what we waiting on. What's what's what's the problem. What's the house up? Like we we fucking know like you getting fed. We have amazing time together like good conversation good dates, you know the sex is great. Like what what what what's what's going on?  What we doing like items really on some live now shit like Gia. I honestly I've been on this for years, but for real for real like as I've been getting older over the past few years, like I've seen I've seen just it's either been too many close calls or people that I love slip away out of through my fingers and it's like we what what the fuck  Gov are people waiting for oh, imma do it tomorrow. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna start tomorrow. Okay, what if you don't get that chance tomorrow be like, why don't I give me my roses nail that give me my ring now bitch to fuck like what give him up now? What are let me pass away with it on my finger already there lies a bitch who did wait, that's a bowl.  Go ahead pause that write it down. I need you to send that to my mom. That's it. Well, well, let me ask you this because of course, we're the same age. And of course we have like friends who are the same age or slight maybe slightly younger and maybe slightly older. What do you think about women who are kind of just you know feeling like they missed like the love train a little bit and what you mean, they're just like well because like dating is hard like it's not easy like both  Both of us have been on dating apps. I got to the point where I've I got so frustrated with being on the apps and dealing with some of the things that I was dealing with that. I just I disable my accounts. I'm like, I'm done. Like I can't it's it was it was getting to the point where it was it was making me sad because I'm like wow because you know, so women are now there are a lot of women who are our age and maybe slightly older and then slightly younger who were just kind of saying, you know, what at this point if  Of happens. It happens. I'm just going to focus on my career and stay at our focus on whatever it is, and I'm trying to my purpose whatever but what did you think about the women who are now kind of Taken fat and creating a family into their own hands like instead of saying I'm gonna want to be married or I want at least have like, you know a significant other like it's women who were going out here. Now who are just saying, you know what I ain't got no nigga. Imma find me a donor. I'm going to do x y z and I'm going to go ahead and I'm gonna start my own family. Like, could you see yourself?  Like if you don't see yourself in a relationship say for example within the next 2-3 years, but you decide that you are ready to have kids. Are you just going to completely hold off on having kids because you're not in a relationship or it could do you see yourself possibly either adopting or getting a donor. That is a good fucking question good question. So that's what question Savannah guess. I feel like  In two or three years because I've already started prepping my mom like a you know, you might you might want to get comfortable with the idea of a puppy grandson because maybe I don't see any any prospects in the near future, but honestly, I am like the Eternal like Die Hard Road.  Antic, I am forever a fan of he's out there ladies. He's out there y'all and I feel like even though you know, we've been unlucky in love thus far. I feel like  it's going to happen. I feeling I fear I feel it in my ball. We just don't put ourselves out there enough like for real for real you put yourself out there on them on the dating, but you wasn't for real for real you was playing with them young men, but I was he the one time I didn't play and no time out we go, but the one goddamn time.  A bit that was enough to make a bid to delete the out after that situation. And that's one time I step here I go. I got fucked over so I'm in it. I'm done. That's bitch, you know what that was fair enough, but I feel like even with every bad situation that we've gone through is just kind of okay that's showing us.  What we don't want even more like right kind of prepping us for the future so we can identify it. I guess better of or identify the qualities better in someone better suited for us. But back to your question. I'm sorry beard off a little bit. I don't know if I would depending on how hard the the baby fever hits me because bitch I had a moment today where I had to literally  This Woman's office because my eyes welled up with tears because one of the one of the folks that work in one of our buildings, he bought his newborn son and he's three months old the cutest thing ever, but he just he had to loan as crocodile tears dropped down from his eyes and he started silently crying but it wasn't like an irritating whale of a cry. It was just like bitch. I've had the hardest morning ever. I just  need a hug type cry and he looked at me and bitch. I lost my shit and I walked out of their office and I walked in mind and I closed my door and I said, oh no, this is this can't end it didn't help that. I it didn't help that I said and I tagged you exactly I you talk to you and baby pictures and shit up in this question. Will you mother fucker? Stop guys are definitely sentence.  Body son up to be trapped. I got the time nor the energy leave me alone. You included shit but back to the question. I don't know if I'd adopt her anything depends on how how how cold that baby fever hits me in a few years. I might you know, I might consider the other options, but, you know a bitch like to travel and vacation and Shop. I don't know if I'm if I'm willing to  Invest all that money in the other options if it doesn't happen naturally for me, then I'll probably just be like, okay. Well, it ain't in the cards and just showing you and you're with me. Okay, and you would honestly be okay with that like you well then I don't think I don't think I would settle for that.  That that would be like, I don't know. I don't know if I'd have another Choice. Well, there's always another choice, but I think I would have to settle for that decision and you know, make peace with it over, you know time. Right right because I don't think I'd be completely okay with that, but I would have to make myself be okay with that. What about you? Listen? I know.  This is this is the thing. It seems like every time we you know fall onto the deck of a new year, I start thinking like goddamn I'ma be whatever age this year, you know, but it I think it hit me a little harder because I'm for real gonna be in my forties Netgear. Like it ain't no it ain't no I'm turning 37 next year old just turning 38  And that next chapter I'm finna be Forte 14. Okay, and so, you know being a woman, you know of of an age, you know, I'm 38. I just  I haven't had a lot of consistency in my life like with in terms of you know, when I went to college I wasn't, you know, I wasn't able to really decide most definitely what I wanted to major in career-wise. I changed my mind every other day like about what it is that I want to do. I change my mind all the time about, you know, like certain things that I want in a partner versus things that I'm  Love to just kind of say hey, that's not that big of a deal. I changed my mind on so many things but the one thing that I've been consistent about in my life is being a mom and you know, I I'm like you like I definitely I believe in love but I am getting to the point where I'm kind of like  These niggas were the ancient like oh y'all really not changing yo-yo. She also consulted liege. Yeah. So we y'all consistently the same type of niggas like every year like no change. No nothing. So I feel like I don't think that it's fair to me as a person who wants to be a mom that I sit back and I just wait for a nigger to come along. So my thing is is yes now I've never  You know, and I know this is going to say I'm bad and if you are a person who is adopted like I don't mean this offensively at all.  I've always wanted to just have my own child because I wanted to be able to look at that child and maybe see hints of me and you know see things like be able to look at them like goddamn little bitch. You took my whole fuckin like the whole damn thing. Look at you and you look down below like your mom a bitch. Hey, yeah, so I just I've never Wonder really does so up for me. Yeah, I could absolutely positively see myself saying you know what?  I'm not about to sit up here and let my eggs dry the fuck up because you know after 35 that egg quality starts to diminish and and shit starts happening to the point where my ass then got scared and I'm taking my all kinds of like supplements shit to make sure that when is time for The Firm to meet these eggs. They it ain't no bitch you too old like it it's ready and then of course having you know pregnancy complications like in the past it  Is just like that really cuts my shit down. So I don't have another year to year 3 years the way and then who's to say like I might even meet someone say tomorrow might be you know at Publix or some shit and I might meet somebody but who's to say that that somebody that I meet is going to be ready to have kids like they might say well shit, you know, let's let's wait till we've been dating for like two years we get married and two years bitch. I don't got that doesn't and I know that  there are some people who have kids like in there like 4142, but I don't know I that ain't gonna be me. So I would absolutely take shit into my own hands. Like I would absolutely do it. You ready to be an auntie. Yeah. I am currently an auntie stay not till after Matthews how y'all doing first off nephews? You shouldn't be listening to this shit because ID curses  Get into that. But yeah, y'all shouldn't even be here in this shout out to yeah, get off get off the goddamn social media and stop listening to x-rated podcast. No bungee circling back to a dick season being upon us. I had a question that popped up and now  In said dick season, there's dick being slang forth, you know strewn about the streets and whatnot. So in preparation, do you have a whole bag in the car or do you keep a whole bag in the house? Because you never know when when you go meet that cold little piece on the street. Let's wait the car looking so so we do a one-night stands and Dick season like I just met you.  When you if you running know if you run into somebody like hey, I see doing here. Oh, that's it. Lets go with this. Listen. Yeah. Okay. I'm hoping that I run into. Yeah, you just made me reminiscing now my cheeks hurt because I'm smiling so hard damn it.  Listen, if we go, I hope the fuck.

spotify:episode:1s0jqZ9hhLH71JgcG2VQCd	Welcome back to slightly underwhelming the podcast that made President Johnson resign on the first episode of season two will be giving a recap of the important things that have gone down at Wesleyan since our last episode and sitting down with the student from each class on campus to chat about the first couple months of the semester cue intro.  Welcome to Wesley and update. I'm Terrell Wilson and I'm Calvin holiday as I alluded to at the top of the show. Well, we were chilling on summer vacation. The former president of this fine institution was not shelling from what we understand Eric Jensen step down because he wasn't getting along with the vast majority of his staff. And because he ghosted us last year when we asked him to come on podcast. We don't miss him all that much. We do miss our first dog Calvin though. So if you want to help the slightly underwhelming team dognap him will be having an informational meeting and State Farm Hall. 110 7 p.m. On Monday October 28th, speaking of things that make everyone's life harder for no reason. We had lots of changes to Sodexo this semester. You'll be happy to hear that everything that sucked last year sucks even more this year everything that used to work is now useless. Hey Tara you remember when we could get free food whenever you wanted. No. Yeah. No neither do I now if you want to go to Dugout you got to use much money and I like negative three dollars in much money. Well, you could use a meal.  Swipe at like 259 three o'clock. Oh, yeah. No that makes everything. Okay then and wait, how do you have negative three dollars in much money much like the rest of my life a long series of mistakes and I get much he's like a motherfucker.  In 1969 a time capsule was placed deep in the foundation of the Mark Evans Observatory by Apollo 8 astronauts Frank Borman. And now for the question, you've all been asking yourselves. What is in that time capsule that everyone was so excited to dig up, you know about there's a letter in it that says something super cliche like whoever is reading this 50 years from now. I hope I will is this proud and prestigious of an institution then as it is now, you know some goofy sentimental ship.  Okay, cool, but hear me out what if this very capsule on our campus holds the confidential files that prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that the moon landing was faked boom baby some notes and words of wisdom from old faculty members will be in there too. You know that me a nice touch. I'm telling you the whole thing was staged by NASA. There's no way we had the technology in the good old summer of 69 to throw a dude up there and who would suspect I was the  Eating place. No one that's who yeah, like old-school relics, you know, I'd be pretty cool. I bet they'd be put up on display in the library and you know what else I bet there's proof. It was just a big movie production to get the country excited. We are right in the middle of the Cold War people. There's the potential for an atomic Holocaust and if we're up there chilling on the moon with a can of beer and a lawn chair before the Russians, it'll make us look super cool and take the Public's mind off the crazy world that we live pictures of old students, you know.  Theatre Productions Club pictures and school events God. I wonder what people dress like back then Neil Armstrong. If you're listening to this right now, you are a lying liar who lies and I can't believe you let us believe you actually walked on the giant orb thing in the sky you son of a maybe everyone involved left behind their own personal little trinkets that are just you know, they're to say I was here I was a part of this great moment John F Kennedy, you know, I bet that F stands for John fucking Kennedy believed in you.  Cut and you lied to his memory and also his ghosts If ghosts are real. It was bid day at Illinois Wesleyan few weeks ago and on to give us a recap of that is a GD sister Amber and Kelsey.

Those I can that's why I haven't posted yet. Oh my god. Did you see Becky posted five times in one week? She kept posting pictures with that one girl, but like I didn't think she looked that good in the photos. So what does Sisterhood mean to you? Oh my God tell you about Sisterhood Sisterhood to me is always having a closet of clothes that aren't my own in case I get bored with my own clothes. It's really awesome. You should try it sometime.

Do you remember that one time when we lived in that big room together and we all shared the same mattress and someone was taking a nap do you or do you know where I'm going? Oh my God. Yeah, I do know and like, okay. So one of our roommates she was like we had this bed and they're like seven of us. We all share it. It was like a twin size to like just like a normal bed and one of our roommates was taking a nap at like 2:00 p.m. And there was like a hot dog on the ground and it was so happy buddy, like half-eaten and our roommate like  You like rolled over and she like touch the hot dog in her sleep and she thought it was just a random guys like dick.  It was crazy. You had to be there. I think I did. Yeah. Oh my gosh, and then there's that one time. Do you remember like when we went mattress surfing and we like turn off all the lights and we like blaring music. Okay. I think that's all the time we have for you guys today. Thanks for having us on someone. Let me out of here.  We are already in the middle of a semester at Illinois Wesleyan. So we thought it would be a cool idea to have someone come on from every class for a little round table chat. So let's all introduce ourselves. All right. Hi. My name is Paige McLaughlin. I am a freshman this year at Illinois Wesleyan. I'm a creative writing major and a theater design production film studies minor and I'm involved in way too many things already right for the Argos. I do the podcast here. I  I worked also just for theater stuff in general. I'm in tributaries some in the ASL Club. I probably need to stop myself. Hi, I'm Daniel Mays. I'm a sophomore. I'm an econ and Spanish double pre-law and on campus. I am the social chair for Tau Kappa Epsilon. So all those registered events that I see you all at that's me. I'm also the vice president of The Interpreter to counsel.  And the director of the fraternity sorority Pro game board. So all those homecoming events were also one of our programs with help a cab. And then I'm also one of the co 3 try presidents of model un I don't know. It's a little sketchy. I'm I'm Calvin holiday. I'm a junior marketing major psych minor kind of don't do anything. I'm just kind of here now. I have play intramural soccer. And you know, I'm on the phone.  guest  I'm a terrible person as you guys already know I'm a senior and I'm an environmental studies and economics double major. If you ever see me busting people on campus. I'm the lead RCA over at the office of residential life. I'm also the president of the Peace Garden and an exact number for econ society. And I also Host this podcast. So how's the semester going fucking shitty? We really watching  I mean, I was only 25% of joke and 75% reality. But yeah now it's been pretty Rocky Roads. Why is it your classes or is it like everything else that you could you do a lot do a lot to yeah, just like overwhelming but like it's good because like every every Rocky Road turns into a nice paid one eventually. So I've never heard that I just made it up definitely cold optimism.  Running low. Let's not go back there. I don't know which ones worse freedom I have to do. What I want now is kind of overwhelming. And also I'm taking four classes a semester that are like writing intensive. So I've always got a paper right because I'm taking three sophomore level angles classes and my Gateway class. So like  And I'm writing for tributaries this week. So I've got so much riding to do it's insane. Like there's papers scattered all around my room and on my desk. I'm just a mess his freshman year or I guess I'm sorry. I shouldn't even say that people are going to yell at me God you're so you're so insensitive. I know you can debunk this myth for me or prove. It true is the term freshman condescending. I don't think so, but I'm probably also not the best person to ask because I don't get offended by that Stuffies.  I'm just kind I'm just kind of cell phones like yes, I'm a freshman moving on like the first year freshman. Call me. Whatever you want the first year freshman freshman first year your fresh man fresh. Whatever.  I feel like I think I know what I'm doing and then junior year you actually like know what to expect sophomore. I came back in like, oh my God, I'm so ready for this junior year. I you know, I came back and I hope I'm actually ready for it. Now fingers crossed semesters actually going. Well. It's basically a miracle aside from class. What do you what do you spend your time doing on the weekends? Because I feel like everyone here like talks about like, oh everything is just overwhelming and I'm stressed doing all the things that I'm doing and then it's just like I have all this homework.  And I don't know what do you do to be a person?  Please don't forget what to be people know because I'm thinking this weekend. I literally from Friday night when I got home. Sorry Friday night to like Saturday night. No, that's not it. Is that Sunday night? I left my room once in all that time.  Because I was just like studying for my be law test because you know, I was very unprepared as one is but yeah, I was just studying and you know, I took a break every sooner than I should but yeah. No, it was just I didn't do anything this weekend. I'm actually so proud of you right now. It's a minor miracle. Yeah. It's like from the out so from Saturday morning, I think it was until like Sunday at ten am so I had been out and I  Out from like 10 a.m. On Saturday until about 4:00 in the morning that night and like it. Yeah, homecoming weekend was insane always has and always has to do a bunch of programming for Teague, right? Yeah. It was great trying to make sure alumni don't destroy my house the alumni were so bad this weekend. Yeah, they really were I don't know actually T first time in a long time. We had no damages so I know I think we're at the one of the only  Return to these I know one paternity has gone through 89 beds. Somehow question. Don't ask me whether do it then the last so last time I was at Teague and there were a long night there. They were like throwing glass bottles out of the windows on the second floor. No comment as risk manager that never happened.  And the professional anything to happen there? No cops. Yeah. No. It was fun. I'm right there with you Kara 4 a.m. Sunday morning. Don't know what I was doing. Yeah, it was all those nice. Yeah. Did you real part of King Charles last week? I'm not if you were theater. I was not in King Charles. I worked on the set for King Charles, but I did I did go see it on Saturday, I believe and it was  I really enjoyed it and it was nice to see something. I helped make them together because I've actually worked in theater for three years so like doing this makes me excited. So I'm just really happy. It went. Well. You're not Dead 2 yet. No, not yet II did I have become exponentially more jaded though. That's a result of theater. Like I've been corrupted forever. All right, so we did talk a bit about majors and actually might sorry my econ Professor will say major like major and it  It screws me up every single time and I always think you say about measures anyway, why did you guys pick your Majors? All right, I'll start so I'm econ in Spanish and I always say I meet on in Spanish and I'm like, that's not a few I am but I'm studying econ in Spanish. I chose them. I don't know why I like Spanish in high school and then econ kind of stuck for a while.  I don't know what you started out as though right? No, I started out as international business and then I drop that and change it to international studies and econ and then a minor in Spanish then dropped international studies and change it to econ and Spanish and then minor in Environmental Studies and that's kind of what stuck so far. But yeah, anyone else have a crazy pattern of Majors or is it just seemed like my indecisive you know, why?  Or just like I like to say that I'm setting myself up for the best. I'm setting myself up for failure to put myself in the best spot in case like I do feel like I'll have these things, you know, what's your definition of failure versus success then like if I was like after like I guess two years with two and a half years from now when I graduate like I'm in a position where  I feel like I have a lot of doors, you know, so like if I were to  You like when you're stumbling out the door, you know, like I'm like hopefully land and one something will catch me. There's a bunch of kiddie pools. I hope yeah, right the safety net. That was 18 at after safety. Net. Do you like anything about like economics in Spanish then? Oh, yeah. Well, I think it's super cool like language is super interesting to me and like I'm going to Spain next semester. So being able to communicate to someone in their native language will be really cool, right? You know, because yeah,  I've always always upset that my parents never because my mom's will be Italian when I grew up and she never my grandma and her never taught it to me. So I was like come on but now it's my chance like solidify what I know and hopefully learn a little bit and I feel like econ helps you see the world work in a different way, which is interesting. So I know you're also an econ major terrorist. So I am oh my God, so I actually came in to Wesleyan undecided because I was very  He very decided on the fact that like I did not know what I wanted to do at all. So I came in and like my advisor was like bucket take these classes and I was like, alright Professor soltan, you know me you who we met for 20 minutes and I'm sure you know how to determine my life path. Yeah. It was perfect. I ended up in like calculus. Yeah. I ended up in calculus and environment Society calculus actually almost made me a math major because yeah, yeah because my head Professor scheele Lou and I really really enjoy  But then I got to environment and society and was like, wow, this is really fucked up like damn. All right, there's some real like terrible issues happening right now, but then I was like Terry you're still indecisive. So I took another class my second semester that was called ecology and environmental problems. And that scared the shit out of me promise. Like Climate Change is Gonna kill us all and so I was like, I should be Environmental Studies to see like I love to help people and I love being outdoors and I think this is the best way to like combine those two.  And then I got to sophomore year and I was like Environmental Studies isn't isn't going to make me marketable. I was really really worried that like I wasn't going to be able to find a job after I graduated and so I thought about psych for a while and then one of my friends at the time was like no you shouldn't do that and I was like, I guess you're right in econ 100 class with I'm Professor dirtball and the deeper you get into it the more you realize like that's kind that really is how the world works, you know, and I love being able to like do that peek behind the curtain of like well, why did  Things flow this way or like people talk about like the market and recessions and like interest rates all the time, but actually like understanding what those mean is like a whole other world and I think like a lot of people think that Environmental Studies and economics like our capitalist system doesn't really mesh with like the like environmental framework that we have right now, but I would love to be able to like work on something like that to really get that going which is very long answered race.  Do you know how I decided on coming the Wesleyan how I was very hung over and we were about to visit DePauw the one with the w and Indiana and it was like 7 a.m. And we have to go hop on the bus and I was like, yeah. No, I'm not doing this so from bed. I'm like, yeah, Mom. I'm going to Leslie and I I've decided that I liked Wesleyan so much. I do not want to try anywhere else and then I went back to sleep.  Months later, you know here I am. I'm not couple months later, but that's how it's good. Yeah.  You know that song up blame it on the I know but in all seriousness, I'm glad I'm here mostly cause the boss sucks and I'm kidding. I like here. I'm glad I'm here good people could place it cast good better podcast. So, Illinois Wesleyan was like the last dead last on my school's to go to really yeah. Yeah my one criteria because I was decided on undecided my one criteria of her school is it had to have one?  10,000 students and and no one figured that this is not like I remember specifically coming on the tour here and hating it because I was like, I am not coming to this school. Why am I and I applied because like they don't require an essay. It's just the common and that's because I had to for other colleges the like, oh my goodness. So I applied and then like there was so for me. It was either California or bust to like if  I wasn't going to go to California. I was going to go to school in Illinois and it turns out that other colleges are quite expensive and this school offered me the best financial package and like logistically it made more sense like traveling back and forth. So here I am. I didn't like it for the first couple years and now but I enjoy your know. I was gonna go to Santa Clara but then money yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I almost went to UCLA, but then I knew I could not imagine you would.  CLA, oh I can what so what would you get? What advice would you give to yourself a year ago today? So your last year self? What would you tell them avoid tequila avoid Taka?  And get your shit together.  Do you think you'd listen to yourself? If you said that um harder question not to get your shit together. I would definitely avoid the alcohol because I'm I'm definitely paranoid enough. That would be like if someone from the future came and told me not to drink this. That means some shit went down. So yeah, I'm definitely listen to that part. But like I would definitely not get my shit together like dude, who are you to tell me what to do and I'd like ignore the part where it's me.  I'm here is is here with a the first the first year has to say and then fresh but yeah the way man fresh get over that advice. I would give myself a year ago today you're going to day me actually kind of had her shit together and then second semester happened and I became a journalism teacher for four months and everything went downhill from there. So fun fat. Yeah. I'm going to tell that story because that's year ago me that I kind of wish I could have changed so  My journalism teacher got for not quite fired, but we'll say it was demoted demoted no longer the journalism teacher at my school and me as the editor of the newspaper and the only one who any clue what the fuck they were doing what they were like you want to step up and teach this class for the last four months of your senior year of high school with no pay and I'm like, okay because I want the paper to work out and because I put a lot of hard work into it and it was a whole thing.  And I did the whole senior issue for my class of like 68 by myself, and I'm super proud of that by the way like that. I submit I took a whole day off class just by myself. Like didn't ask anybody. I was just sitting email on my teachers like this is what I'm doing. Send me the homework and they're like great you do you boo, but yeah, I got my first D because I took so much time out of that class failed my first final I was so mortified, but I'm glad I did it and then turns out they got rid of the journalism program this year after all that work I put into it, so I'm not  Not salty, but yeah tanked my grade for all that but I'm proud I did it's good portfolio. Good English experience. Got to give an f to someone. I really hated. It was so good. And it was so good. It's like he thought he could half ass and get away with it the mic. No, I'm your teacher. Now you son of a bitch. That's the craziest Power Trip I've ever been in my life. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. No. You're welcome. All right, mr. Wants to hear what the man fresh has to say your turn.  I just want to say that why seniors don't rule the world a year ago today.  I would tell myself to go find the econ 102 tutor Terror will see I'm getting that was serious. But like queasy at the same time, I would say check yourself calm down. I don't even know what I was doing a year ago today. Like I was rushing a fraternity which was like  I was going to ever do that.  But now I don't think I think I would tell myself to like live a little more, you know, just because I was super involved and just like not involved but like super just like I don't even know what I was doing. Yeah, that's my answer just calm down, you know to my present self to and everyone just like relaxed senior Parables like junior year. It was a crazy year for me. It was crazy tough and it was  So like my academic year was yeah a really tough time. I had take that was taking a senior Sam. Thanks fun. I had just gotten back from my Freeman Asia internship and I was like readjusting and like everything and I had just started like real training as an RCA. Everything was going crazy all at once and I wish I could have told myself. I kind of burned a bridge that I wish I hadn't and so I probably tell myself not to do that and things aren't quite as insane as I had thought they were  I I had recently gone through a really rough breakup and I would have told myself don't get back into that. You stupid son of a bitch and then on the same note though tell myself like you are gonna do really good things like you're going to look back on yourself like so my senior year looks back on my junior yourself and I'm really proud of everything and that I did that year and everything. I was able to kind of like established during that time and that's something that I personally struggle with a lot is not thinking like I  A lot of substance as a human being and I would have told myself like this year. You're really going to make that happen. You're gonna like that part of you that you finally get to like reconnect with everything that you care about like you're going to reconnect with it, and it's going to be great and you're going to be fine.  Right now, yeah, so what's your biggest concern today? I can talk about that first if you guys want a second to thank you. What is your biggest concern? I don't like to because like to go ahead and ones really dumb and the other is dominant different way.  One I really don't want them to mess up the last season of Supernatural right? I'm so sorry, but like no that's so hun Ruess thing everything if they fuck it up. I would be so pissed. I'm sorry the two main characters in Supernatural are super attractive so hot  All day every day being I think I own the only reason why I made it watching it so far with simply because all the characters were so sexy. I would very Misha Collins if he came in the store right now, like am I the only one Misha's even? Okay. Okay. Okay. Sorry other kids other more reasonable concern.  So I got hit with like a random wave of baby fever like a couple weeks ago. And then I was thinking about like do I want to have a kid in this shitty-ass world? Like do I want to have bring a kid into the world is going to end like 30 years, you know, and I'm just like shit.  Yes, it wasn't my concerns is your local is Major. I am also very concerned me is always money. I actually like I looked at my bill today. Like I went to the business office today and put my paycheck and my Builder like oh you have to have this thousand dollars paid by the end of month and I'm like, yeah. I know. I don't need to be reminded. Thank you. Thank you so much for reminding about the poor financial decisions. I'm making with my life instead of going to is you like I should have done right now. I think my biggest  Learn is my well-being and the well-being of people around me with regard to mental health because she'll mental health days. I know is it I did not plan that yeah, I just feel like right now like these past like three weeks for like not only myself but everyone around me has just been like so shitty. Um, so my biggest concern is like I have  I've no idea what I want to do when I graduate like I like looking around at jobs. It's like there are so many options available that it just shuts you down the second you even want to search for a job and then I start thinking about sitting at a desk all day and I start like feel myself atrophy both like mentally and physically and then I have a bit of a panic attack and then it's just like  You have a ton of things to do for senior some girl leave that alone. So we're going to do some lighter stuff to kind of wrap everything up and we have a request for the best. Would you rather on this page? Which is would you rather all your haircuts end up looking like a loaf of bread or every piece of furniture you sit on turns to wet sponges this hurts me because I don't like imagining that like the squish.  I think what would get to you after a while not even feeling it's the sound the sound which is great on you after a while. We're just I can't even make that sound. Can you imagine like waking up in the morning and you're just damn and pruney so we can look in the mirror at least all the time with my hair was like oh  Loaf of bread but like what kind of loaf of bread we're talking like loaf of bread you get in the bags of the story talking like a homemade loaf. We talking like the kind of lobes you get it like restaurants that they like give to the whole table. But you eat all of them. Is it straight or sideways exactly. They're so like loaf of bread like Define loaf of bread here guys. Well now I'm imagining like, you know, those like loaf that you can braid together as like three different things in there all flavored. Yeah, I'd be so like I would just have a braid all the time then, you know, yeah cool braided bread.  No, no. No, that's some of us people are getting like a low but what's a normal loaf know what I mean? Do I leave I hope so the grading or be that every time you sit down you literally just like to return this way sponge, but does that mean it's a sponge for everyone else to or do this? Everyone just think you're crazy like the summe sitting on a couch with like three other people like do they also feel the sponge? I'd be angry if my friend came over and turn my couch and doing fun. Oh my  Imagine it was like delusional and you were going crazy you just tripping and yours.  Macaque normally just I don't have a loaf of bread on the head right now. That's all you have to do your an influencer man. Thank you. Yeah, because MB. How do you seem like like some crazy Street where like how they where just oh have I say crazy? Yeah. It wasn't a hair. It would be a trend. I would still marry her so suppose you and I hope I hope she gets a little bit better one day. That's all I'm saying and then you guys can have a little  A literal bun in the oven God damn it.  All right. So to wrap up this segment, we're going to have all of us compliment everybody else.

She mess just sit that drink so she can know I don't never know why she was there who you judging girl that came in there and gave it to you straight up now. Tell me do you?  We want to like and even that was better than what you produce. Why every dime you always hating on policy don't know why it's just certain people that don't need to say nothing. Hey Simon was gonna tell me nothing working mother. I stepped in here. And when we stepped in here you came you was in the US of a now maybe if I was over in your lands, you know across the pond then you judge me so harshly but also watch your mouth when and then what  Randy the honest honest, okay, so he was giving it to him. He used to sit there quiet. When used to kill me about Randy keep calling everybody dog. I had to tell him after I got to Hollywood. Oh, hang on be too many more dogs gonna say my name. My mama named me Walter and every day. We call me Walter.  Ha ha ha and like and then they don't even be the one that I wanted it to be. So then it's on something that has absolutely nothing to do with any relevance. It's funny. It's not he just went on his whole rant and I recorded secretly and he is in normal. He says sometimes because I recalled him but he still funny I don't care if y'all think that water is hilarious. We should do another pod called. What is it?  What that's what you got going next.  So yeah, call him slipping recording them. He's funny. I do I do it makes me uncomfortable. Like that's a trust issue. I'm standing here talking to you and all along you recorded my private thoughts. That's not cute. It's not know them is my private thoughts. If I'm not that I wouldn't say. Alright, I believe it. You don't need to be judging anybody Paula. Well, but anyway, that's what you always hit their nice give it to you.   She don't think or this in Des. I really didn't like when she was when pay attention first came you telling her she was bitchy bitchy bitchy. I don't give a fuck if her pitch was under the radar and over it. As long as her tone was correct. All right, and it hit my ear pleasing not like straight up now. Tell me I like the song. Yeah, but how many times are you going to listen to that song?   Maybe sorry, I don't feel as though that's the problem right then and there that was your generation playing around with people's emotion letting them think that shit is cute and awesome. Like you should have nipped that shit in the bud right away. It shouldn't have went nowhere just loud in my ear and catchy though. It was catchy, but it was no more than a foot. There was like a jingle that you hear on a TV show so but I really like a theme song No No, but listen at the end of the day, so  We just won't go, but we will be back on the why you did that like getting these people is here ready, and then, you know, we'll be back on tonight because it's Saturday right now.

We are I'm saying I want to be in their face because I want to say it to people like I've never it's like so you ever like sometimes for me I could be sitting back and I'll be looking at somebody maybe singing I just feel like I'm pulled to tell them you do not pose a continue to sing this type of music opposed to get on back home down here church. I'm a I'm a  So Justin Bieber at you Justin beat you known from in the fact that the fact that she yelled that out when she is known.  From the day that that video first came the fuck out. It was just something in me that don't like the something in you and I don't know what it is. And I don't you ever meet him up against just something about him that just grind grind your fucking dick that I liked it. That's a baby baby. Just the song is stop grinding my gears. I don't know if it was his because I'm not saying he can't sing because when he really would he really do try or he's or he singing a slow song to hear that he can sing. It's just it was something about his persona.  On his face, like if I had been in school with him. I don't know like every time you to raise his hand out of turned around. Oh my God till we would have eventually fought. I'm sorry. It's just something about you. It's just something about you. Remember it don't be for nothing. It's just some people their energy and then you just don't like him. I just don't like them. I just don't like it. I just don't like them not to say that make the ones around me like, sorry.  You have won me over.  That was a great song. That's it. That's it. Okay. Yeah, I don't know. I don't know what it is. I'm gonna throw out every be the see Reba McEntire's my baby.  Phil about it. She that's a comedian she made those comments in it was a joke and my problem with her was backpedaling the fuck. Am I said that shot us at right in it. I said it you said you said it because I'm trying to figure out what it is y'all are really going to do save for take that TV show and then I would have been on Twitter with that fuck that TV show. Well, I ain't been on that TV show and some odd years y'all come back with all these reboots. Fuck it my money solidified, but it obviously  Because they said they'd seen her out there somewhere in California look a mess and she did she looked a mess and she called the cops on somebody was trying to get their own there took had when I was tied with a rope on her something more crazy. She didn't well, that's not that's not from her being poured that's from her being, you know, her mental issues. She's got problems.  But the thing is I'm not about kids. Nobody else was a joke. And when I saw when I looked at the lady I felt when she would say, I mean, but I agree we as a people can feel some type of way. But I mean we talked about each other as as any race, we talked about each other at all different times, but certain things that should be said in behind closed doors. Like we don't we  I don't know. I can't say I wouldn't be on national TV or tweet about somebody like that. Like I wouldn't just toast shit at trial even though I don't like Trump and some of the things that he do I like some of the things that you do and I don't like some of the things you do. No, I don't think he should be president again, and that's just my band.  I think his son looks like The Purge and I must say that in four years time and I want you in this is some real shit in four years time when it go to window. I mean not for years time, but they come up time for him to get in the house again. I guarantee you we great. So so what is that like a how long is that a way to election? And then I guarantee you will discover that he ate.  It ain't going to be no vote.  He in there Baron if that no Trump just add that kids not of age yet. But if he is not the epitome of the omen mayor and yeah, you should be in that movie. I love that be a remake. That'd be a hell of a remake it as a joke, but I know what I feel in the spirit. He's still there.  How would you know what this localized? Who is we that you would be paying that close attention Okay. So what we saying that mean I was touching on something so that that don't do that because then that look like you was where I was right all along but I know I'm right. He said the whole family is reminiscent of The Purge, although specially that one son and just  His wife us where she is. She is trapped. Boom. She came. Yeah, she's pretty but she can't get out there she talk much. I don't know she give me Katie Holmes every time I see her. She look like a the old not look her attitude. Okay everything about her just screams free me.  Yeah, Katie Holmes did look like that every picture. You just look trashy Tom Cruise. She always look like she just did not see she sell out of place like it, which is I don't know. I really thought her and Jamie Foxx was one last I didn't it wasn't evenly yoked. Okay, I'm gonna throw somebody else.  It's not too much. It's not too many people that really grinds my gears. It's not know. I know somebody that's like years Paula Abdul for no reason. It ain't for no fucking reason. It's for a reason for no. Listen. This has been going on since I was like 13.

I am if you live in London, you've been seeing it just for UK. Generally. It's kind of been a bit of a shit show. Yeah, it's just been and I would literally wake up this one as a time. So this is that literally how simple I was thinking. I'm just tired or bad things happening and if I know bad things have always constantly happened and it's not it's nothing new like the world has been like this for a long time and it's just a case of it's just more televised now, it's a mall you see it more now, but it's just like constantly there is no  No, yeah every day. They're just some bullshit. We've got fucking lodge out as fucking refusing to leave fuck off Teresa because your  Right. Yeah, we again did it right for you? And you said no I'm not going they still don't have a government. I don't imagine being that is that your man say, I don't want to do this anymore. Are you moving? So I don't need this anymore is that now but I was now we just go home. It's just sky, but yeah, so where does here maybe with a little bit of rest by and just a little bit of happiness because it's yet it can all seem very I've been very mentally draining absolutely way.  These things have been happening. Like there's always been things happening. But now you log onto Twitter and you expect it to be like some light relief, but you've got you know, you follow all the new even if you don't work in the media, you follow these new sites and you see everyone tweeting about it and you're like wow, but why do they bad love about the social media side of it is that you can see everybody that comes together. It's a poor and it's absolutely like heartwarming to see like, you know, Marv, he cited the go go fun.  - yeah, just like seeing that being retweeted everyone, you know. Yeah supporting each other. Yeah, by the way, if you want to donate if you're in the UK if it's for the fire everything, so this is for the fire that happened at our block in elaborate Grove, which is really close to where we used to record because the other way and people are going to need support and help and like imagine just losing everything. So if you are looking for somewhere to donate money, there's two  places that we've heard of one is if you go to on Twitter at Shams face for music, she has a GoFundMe page and at Marv Abby has a GoFundMe page and also they're tweeting details if you want to like physically go down and help or if you want to donate things like any little thing that we can do. I think it's a game don't know which I can even if it's like the smallest amount that no amount is too it's going to make a difference because I just like to retweet it Cheryl. Yeah. Just get it out there and let's just  Let's see how much we can help people and not focus on the shit of the world and just focus and like the goodness the changes that we can make. Yeah, and if you have any ideas of them even show up before tourism a comes if you forget your but, yeah, so I hope you guys are well and doing good and we're here to put a smile on your face by all their shit.

Hi when you've had too much sweets and you need to like poop, but it's just an overview ask but it's not like you're constantly it. Yeah, it just kind of like yeah just random bottle of water is my mom has a random bowl of war in the house and we've got like a big Jesus and I house that we call doing on in yo in Colombia, so she's got it there and there was just like a bottle of water in the kitchen and I was thirsty so I drank it and my mom came down. She was like Molina  Where is the water and I was like I just drank it. She was like oh my God. Oh my God is holy water, and she's taking it to them hot hot hot hot  My charge dating anymore or one that's the best ones are like a couple of nuts in your mouth.  And this year in a bang you need a good nothing. What why you got to take it there God.  Guys, I was just talking about like I don't know what it is with me, but I'm literally like even in my friendship group as well. They're just like Molina really how I just said. Hello. How are you? How are you? Turn it sexual? No, it's just me. He's like that. You know what it is. It's because I don't get it, but I'm like that. Yeah three-phase have someone at work that out by perfect. I say sexual things. She was that you do things as if you're trying to turn someone on I was like really she's like, yes you black you go put your lipstick on but you're doing it if someone's watching you doing  Yeah, yeah, there's a couple times you've done shit and I'm like, you know, because I've seen you switch I've seen you there is a source.  No, that's your source is called guy up. I think I can but I think for me everything's about banter. So it's like I have to make somebody laugh and that's kind of like my flirting way with some as my way of letting somebody.  I don't know though. If I've got like actual game again. I don't know what that means. What does it mean to have game? Because I know I can I know it on a guy but I don't know whether I have yeah, I think I do. Okay, does it work? I think is Gamers because I think there's some guys that don't need game and I feel really good looking. Yes, and I think most if not all girls don't need game because I think game to me is that I wasn't even checking for you like that. But now I'm like shit. So I really fancy this guy like, where's this come from and I think for girls we don't  A lot of us don't need you. I think it's hard to get a guy that doesn't like you to like you. Yeah, because if there's a way bring me I think girls that quote unquote unconventionally unattractive year. I'm trying to find a nice way of saying clouds basically, but I think it's the same it's the same thing with girls as it is with guys people that are not conventionally good-looking have the best game because you have to you have to do but I don't know.  If I'm wrong, but I think I know girls that if a guy moves to her she knows how to keep him interested. Yeah, I like when they first meet.  Happy that guy and he was like, wow, I like anybody know what I really got the most out. There is seen across my number. That's yeah, even now even the even just say that you're gonna have to talk. Yeah, when you're talking to a guy of engaging with the glider in like you're having an amazing conversation. He doesn't ask for it. I don't understand. So anyway, yeah. Yeah, what was that like  but having said that many times that I've got I've given a guy my number and never replied in the morning like yeah, of course because it's like you're not drunk anymore you're lying.  If I have game, I don't know however move toward I've moved to a guy before so, you know my ex-boyfriend the one that recklessly cheated on me. Yeah, he I moved I moved to him my things. He's the kind of gotten this is these are the kind of guys that I love not guys that don't pay you and you mine cause I don't like that even like I need a little bit of Engagement, but guys that just don't do too much like guys that are very mysterious and I remember the first night. I met him. He was like minds of his business chilling in the corner and he was the only guy not in the dance world doing power and doing the most really made me attractive.  To him, so I was just smiling hard, but I don't think that's very gamey smiling like them like smiling bear hard and that eventually I went over and I was like obviously works. I ended up with him for five years or five years. I think that is you know, what I do that a lot. I dropped the Latina card in there a little bit.  Okay, I like money bouquet in Colombia. I spoke am Latina, you know that works with God. I think that works though. No, but I'll I mean game is there's a let's say there's a guy you like now and your call like whatever but you like him how you how did girls get that guy to like them? Like, I know how guys do it the thing with me. Is that for me to get him to like me? I needn't I'm not going to like a guy that I don't think I've got any chance moves. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I've got my Mystic eyes of the thing is I  because I kind of know where I'm set if I see a guy that I like and I feel like we're still on the same level not being like this is where my reverse body dysmorphia kicks in but I just think specs that he's going to like me or not. I mean, I don't know I suppose when I got doesn't like me. Yeah.  Like why is that you like me? But you have a girlfriend. Are you okay, if nothing else makes sense? You have a girlfriend. Yeah on is sounds so wild by get it. Yeah get it. Oh my God. What do you mean? You don't like me?  So, you know when you like you said there's only so much you can do to get yourself chirps to kind of thing. You're not the type of girl to actually go and approach somebody.  So I saw a guy and he was suited and booted and he looked amazing and I was just in a hoodie jeans and van so I looked like about 12 years old. So he didn't even look twice at me, but he was literally the love of my life. So I was walking past the bus stop when I was like, you know, I'm just going to wait at the bus stop. I don't need to get over there but my car is parked. I don't need the bus, but I went in front of him also. Oh, yeah.  I think so many times the two five nine come here. Like I've been waiting here for long and he's he was giving me the answers, but he was just not interested. I really wanted him to I really wanted to show him my Instagram just to show this is what I really look like. Yeah, like this is just a bad day and I'm a hot jalapeno popper for war but don't you find that when you look dead and you get chapter like yeah judge people for that. I wish it was me. What like this  I said no questions. No, but I looked at it. I looked when I mean did I mean like when you really rough? Yes, I get some like Hot Doritos from the shop and like some milk or something and then you go back to your house like that on the level. I'm a bit like always the one when I'm in my Jungle Book pajamas because I am no I am so bad that because when I'm back in the ends back in like Essex year, I actually do not  not care what I look like when I leave that to the point where literally like if I need to go and get milk or whatever because there's a shop right across the road from my house. I will literally go in my pajama bottoms. Yep. Yes, I'm bugs. No bra no Bronk my headscarf. Just looking sad and my sisters like you need to stop going out looking at that because one day you're going to see someone and one time I went out and I was sitting on the bench and I swear to God someone left a pound on the on the back.  You're not coming out with me like that number out. What's wrong with them is that these charges of got fucking cold man? See anyone when I don't care. You're not climbing that I'm like I'm not getting dressed up just to go down the road, you know, I mean, so then when that that day that happens when someone left appendix of the bench, they actually what I was homeless it was so bad - poor person has an iPhone 6 you make me wear but I know use my hand as a makeshift like stand for my tips. No nothing.  I feel like I've most like liberated and relax when I'm in those kind of outfit. So yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. I feel like I imagine that no one can see me. I just go out. I just go and do my shit. Yeah. The milk is 150 sweat.  Like that, but they obviously love getting that dressed up over things. I like further the getting dressed usually to the actual event. Oh, it's times especially when you go Raven getting ready to go out is almost hey, you know, I love taking that picture and your friend is like, oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God, and you're like and you're like, I'm bad. I'm site badges getting to the point where like now like, I genuinely have a better time once I've got my money shot. Yeah. It's actually Jenny you feel like the outfit and that makeup isn't wasted.  There I will have don't need help. My first time I came up I can imagine that you think like that a hundred. Yeah, I do. So question girls question. Would you ever propose to your man? Absolutely the fuck not wow. Yeah, it said no farms and no never that's not what God is Enough from Consuela. However, however, how not gonna you out of all of this you are not gonna like  If it works for you, it works for the thing is Miss a no-face zombie saying what you're doing. Yeah. So like if they say yeah, they they do say like I don't wear that.  They are plenty of things can use your feelings for yeah, like a lot of Happiness sadness. Youkai emotional empathy right half and about sympathy personally shouldn't be affecting your life. I just I've never I well to be honest. I don't even know when I'm getting married or engaged. I just can't see someone else doing it to me. But anyways, I couldn't get on my whole knee my heart. I should drop me a hug.  Only tiny Thomas be dropping to my knees when I'm and I knew without a doubt it was gonna go there are you know, how I feel about Japanese give her I'm now dropping into my whole one lie to give you a ring that I have spent my three wages. You mean I have engagement ring they do.  I don't know how it works in that can be in band and then you've got the you expect him to take initiative who asked you to be their girlfriend who asked you out on dates. I'm very here for  Narrative, I like that. So if I'm in a relationship where that has you've asked me to be your girlfriend, you've asked me on a date you've asked me to do all these things. I've always been I've been one boyfriend you to then I say yeah, but there's somebody that's like yeah, but that holding company thing is not normally outsourced. Oh shit. I can't come and I think about how did you do it be something you had spoken?  About previously. So what do you think? It's a woman if you know how I feel about it. She's like you're being long. Yeah, and I don't want it to get to a point where I'm just doing it because I'm tired. I want it to be done because you want to do it. Yeah because I can't have what circumstance but I don't know what's on that. I don't think that actually  Through her boyfriend a really massive surprise party and it was for his birthday and she actually proposed to him in front of everyone. So not only are you proposing a dent in front of a crowd. Yeah, so he proposed in front of his family her family everything I'm doing  so he obviously said yes, but the shock in his face because it was videoed and put on Facebook the shot and you like he was on my man look like she had stuck a finger.  His ass because the shock did I ever get married? They're not married. Yeah. Okay cool two years that's going to be I got coming engaged. Yeah, I just think that if a guy hasn't and that's a good yeah, he's not he hasn't arcs so they say he's not ready you are so you're going to wait until he's ready for that matches exactly as a whole time. Yeah, my the day I would rather just be together and just hope that he's going to do it instead of being strung along. Yeah. You have a conversation.  They have a relationship. You have a conversation. I'm talking like I know but I'm in an adult relationship. You have a conversation that goes. Oh, I know I do want to get married check. The person actually wants to get married check the kind of time frame the wanna get marriages. I'm an ultimatum. Oh word. I would I what's up guys are like, I don't want to get married, but I guess if that's what you want then I'm all right.  We're gonna get ya me your thoughts on marriage. What were your thoughts on cheer? Yeah, like where do you want to live with these discussions on the phone anymore? You know, I mean, I'm pretty well they're going on dates is Cinema mandem. Tell us what you think. What are your thoughts on getting married guy? If you've gotten to the point where you have to propose then you're not on the same page, you know. Yeah. I don't like the idea of it. Like I need to know exactly like you said what your thoughts are my tree. It's also Kill Ya where we go ahead.   Well, did you see it and you know, Jeannie miles is that the head - when I get mad one of my kids and I think when they got together initially she doesn't want to have kids and she said she's never felt maternal. She's ever felt and he basically was like to know what I think I can live without it, but they've been married for nearly 10 years now and he now he wants children about that. And so it was just like she doesn't know what to do because she really genuinely cannot see herself being a mama like it's not something that she wants by blah and it's like for them they did talk about it. Yeah, it's changed his mind. So it's one of those things that your mind.  But at least hey and you have the conversation at least you know that you've done that. Yeah, absolutely. You know that you were on the same page at least when you got together you had a gauge of their opinion or do you think you could ever be with someone that you loved and he said he didn't want to get married but no really we might it no marriage can last question that goes well just because we're like lamenting on the word marriage so much. What's the importance of marriage to you? Why do you think why do you want to get married? And this is what I asked is well because I think of it in two ways.  is sometimes I'm very like, oh, it's just a piece of paper that keeps everyone together and doesn't really keep everyone together really because when you actually get a divorce, it's actually quite expensive and why do I need a piece of paper and our signatures to Define what we have so that's one thought of it, but then the second the other the other part of me thinks it's just a form of like companionship that I can see that you're actually willing to put in the time the effort and  Yeah, this is actually really real For You Joe. I mean, yes, I'm caught I'm really in the middle about it. I don't know if I want to get married. If I don't know about the committee's the commitment aspect. I like and we said it before I said it before when I think of myself like I rate myself highly and I always want the best form of everything. So as far as I'm concerned marriage is the Pinnacle of relationship statuses. I don't see why I should sell and just cohabit with someone when there's something higher, you know, it means that there's that aspect to is the commitment I think.  That when you're married to somebody yeah people could get divorced yet. It's just a piece of paper. But actually you can't just really really can't just walk away. You know, I mean that once you get that harder though, if he does you're going to fight for it more in fact, you know, I mean when you don't vote one of those when there isn't that commitment aspects of you're not committed in ass in a certain respect it's easier to walk away. Like if you just live with someone you actually don't really have any ties to them you can up and leave when you're married. You can't just go and marry someone else and I am yeah the can't just up and  I'm leaving I feel like because you've made that commitment in front of God in front of your friends. You're naturally going to try harder. Yeah, and I think that's what is from because I'm religious you've made this commitment in front of God. Yeah this like this is solidified us. Yeah, like not until after that not until marriage has got actually come and solidify this so he is like stamps this we've done this in front of God. So it's like it's that commitment. It's that it's me you it's God me and you yeah, so it was like a three way to itself to a relationship. So it's a question man. He's going to have both  Yeah, this is the way that God designed it to be and there's a reason why he designed it like this. There's things that people saved her marriage. There's things like that. And yeah, I want to do everything goes. Well, I don't want to do it because it's easier to do it my way like an easy just to be like, yeah, I wanna do this and I'm in love and it a dare but it makes more sense to do it God's way because as I've learned you do things your own way you get burnt. Like I said, wait for a greater purpose exactly. They mean  Always want to follow What God Says in a situation and he said get married and prosper basically. Yeah. I just want to follow on like United. I want to have I want us to be one. I want to see what everyone did to have that blessing of feel. Like I really that's definitely a guy said no for all of us proposing absolutely. Would you give up to me and know I would yeah, I cannot wait. Yeah. I think it gets to a certain point and you think I need to move on with my life.  I need to be as you said I want the best for myself and at the moment if you're waiting around for someone or you're not sure you can feel it's causing you hurt you're crying about it. Yeah, I need to be like look what we're doing here. Yeah, literally I just think that like there's ways in which you can say it so I'm not going to blackmail him and be like well if you don't do it by 2019, I'm gone, but I would be like look this is what I want for my life. And if you're not on the same page, then we really need to start re-evaluating what we're going to do with this. Yeah, exactly. I mean, yeah it is.  And all things of client that is on ya know obviously that thing of New York when she was like I want my eggs cracked. I want my name changed. Yeah, there might be an underlying reason why he doesn't want to get married. You need to get to the bottom of that and figure out, you know, whether you can continue with him when I'm not fighting.  In this life on the whole like making sure that you're both definitely on the same page. I don't think that you can change you can change him. No because he could change niggers but not that about that. It can change you can change the way they dress it up marriages stuff, but you can definitely change you can change the way they eat here s murmee you can do that, but I don't think very fundamentals and things in them that you can't change but I feel like if you have it in you you can make a guy better. I'm convinced that's like changing You by making  I think you change each other now more at stake. I do think you change each other. I don't know. Yeah. Yeah, that's the whole point is poorer than you were five years. All he's done is take from you. I'm actually happy imagine that bending knee and give a speech saying hold darling everybody with my new you know to now  We've been together for a while baby another way for you to do it. You know, you're waiting for him to leave. I don't understand it at all is we do you know how many how many situations I've heard of that. I've been like I was with him for 10 12 years. He never proposed and then he's been with this girl for two months. And I don't know how often that happens. Why does that happen? You know, I would go to the I think yeah, I think yeah.  Because if that happens.  Cookies now he's crazy involve radian because you're exfoliating your form and he's gonna get married when you support them in their careers and they're doing about when you met them working in whatever and they'll be with him. So after not too long after I met my ex broke up, I think I still suck on his Instagram before you blocked me.  He took a cab to The Shard so you went to the fucking shit. Like wow, man, does the problem? Yeah nice because that's what I could afford steak drinking wine. Literally.  Yeah, exactly. That's my dude with that place what it was like it's a small but it's like a rooftop swimming pool to I said, oh, well was it so her house that's emotional know that you shouldn't make a guy better. I didn't have no. No, I don't want to make you better but I don't make sure that you keep your own as well. I don't know. It's just an L. You have to take that you just have to hold it. There's literally no.  There's nothing you can do. So go thinking I'm not gonna make you Baron case you leave it then you're also putting negativity. Yeah. She's holding back how very perceptive  It's you don't see you on foot and that's what is sometimes it's just it's just something that you're not lit you does not matter, but it's just that person to live. No, it's hurtful now have to go and crop you out of every picture and my Instagram even quite badly. But what about on this whole thing of weddings? What about someone else proposing to someone now? What does no way there's no way security security.  Just the thought of someone asking makes me angry that I like. Are you a fucking mad? Even the sort of the somebody make him better than me on the day must be sick. Are you mad or what? I have stopped for Less. Yeah for Less.  Yes, every single Last Detail is expensive the idea that I've saved worked my guts office made all the sacrifices that I can provide all my guests an amazing. What an amazing day. Now you use my burden to become your engage when I use my backdrop my filter, you know what I mean?   Miss Monica. Come here. Yeah, well, they don't know what they're in Ivory. I want the fastest way out of whack with a nice white structured not like a photo will be a distant memory. Don't worry fluffy.   If you're not a virgin, not only a white dress. Anyway, I'm when like Papa pure white dresses are not nice not nice tackle. It's like but it looks like we never really liked white not I think I was where whites make a statement because they are version. So there's definitely that look we're all in eyebrow.  And where was this in Brixton? I wish it was a nice.  You trust no bitch. Necklace Wow Wow for someone. Are you? Okay, but still.   And I described if P plus 1 so when I'm done, yeah, have you ever ghosted someone though? Yeah, but yeah, Cinema guy goes to them that side as well as you broke him in load. You just goes to him. I just stop just stop. Yeah, Jimmy just stopped and I was still not come back at once a week here. I have some people get the message if you if you go still being a try like she's ever. Yeah if it's a guy with a lot of Pride, they'll be like Russia hasn't acted like one freak like three times.  The calling but some guys take that as I'm going to keep on trying to she answers sometimes why annoyed at someone so you're not answering their call, but you expect them to keep trying but sometimes you like I've earned her go to someone it's if I've told them I don't want this to go any further. It's not going to work for me and they're still like a still contacting you then. I feel like I don't know what else to say. Yeah, but I don't like it when someone goes just get it just can't do this ghost in oh, gosh. I just want to  A date man. I'm fucking bored. This is so so bored. I just want I just want something to get science board. I think that we're all a bit like singing Because that's the show's over as the show. No, I've been brought before the show, but I've been that excuse us.  That's why you need to get onto pornhub.com. I'm not a nerd it secures back. Hopefully it's coming back tonight at 23rd because that's sex scene at the end of season one was getting it like if I was to whack that be my material that that might be was absolutely be my wife. You remembered it. No. No, you need to watch our show you a gif of it.  Exactly how you want some he touching somebody's holy life is exactly how you want to be dealt with not that I've liked for by it, you know, like the butterflies you get before that day and you're talking to your girls like oh my God, how dare watch the way I was how many times have I been in the group chat like girls like does this work? Does this not actually right?   One that you you price it the intention of yeah. Yeah, you understand that your body in the picture is that they're strapped? Yeah, if you're fully clothed. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think I've taken their straps on holiday at Sea. I think that's easier. It's easier to do it. Yeah. It's my stomach accepted when you're on holiday because you're not in a bikini like Taylor said in your room is a trap. Well, that's that's that's a child trapped the premium that is  I actively encourage it. I like encourage sending it to a man or person do what you want. Whatever way works for you be the thirst trap. You want to see in the world. That is my motto, especially on holiday because it's so much easier, you know, I love seeing women I've had kids and they still have that rub and it's not even if it's not your ass. You're thirst-trapping--  Be widening leg all that bust it open or anything like that. Yeah a first shock is be so like looks so true. You know, that was that little leg then dumped ways. And if a clock it the different artist Josh nice, but trust me. I know I know you're gonna be a reaction. You just posted like a normal person. No. No, I know exactly what I know. Yeah. Yeah. And the thing is I think you can have different types of fish traps for different types of guys. Yeah. I like your books in the back, you know exactly who that sounds like a studio first trap. I'm speaking a bit too much but you know, yeah.  So first up because you know, like he's into music. Yeah trainers trainers and checked it. I just use my body. Maybe that's what they like, but I think there's like a standard they're strapped. Yeah, you know, but yeah, I think the ultimate thirst trap like is the what the  A selfie where you've twisted and you can see your bum. Yeah, and you're looking back at it. That's you know, what the best rap is as well. You don't post it. You get your friend who has him on social media to post it. What so I've never yeah, so it's like I don't do that dumb shit when you're walking a having a we could mean that's just dumb. Yeah. Yeah not act like you're actively know they're recording. Yeah, but like let them know your ankles. Yeah. Yeah. I thought back to the picture that Lala posted la la la la la he's give him to me.  Like white but she was in a bathroom or something.  One time when I was going on holiday. Yeah. Well, I've got my own me last year me and my girls did she actively went through Instagram and sort of kind of pictures you wanted to take and say oh, yeah, that's what makes it easy for you to save it like that kind of visual director boy when it comes to taking pictures like it away here, right? Like it's just a normal picture just posed in. Is that a first  Rap is what you're showing that is what you're doing immediately make it it depends if a guy that's looking at it like brass. Is it only a fair shop if you're trying to get someone I think yeah, I think you know your head with your intention. Yeah.  Add to that so if someone has a stone that's one of my pictures and Elijah. My head is scattered such that they will know you read it. They gotta be like hasn't even though the swiper Instagram is such a blessing but it's also a don't get to the hot one if you post off. Yeah, then you post it. It has probably done. Yeah. I mean, where is you could post one and that again is save it.  There are so many holiday pictures that I haven't put up like so many pigs. No I am all here for worthwhile was I was I was going to say I was going to say about thirst-trapping-- Oh, there's a girl that I saw her she time ago and I'm like, I love this number and it all the time to press the picture was I was a very innocent picture she had shorts and she just sitting down there like a gonna buy it was  And it shows our Arch maker so beautiful, whatever but yeah called my thighs and I said, yeah love that. She was out here to make us happy flicker Sunset. But yeah, that's my father. Yeah. That's why I hate seeing these pictures of like half-naked girls and they're just like love has no side or just dumped someone about that girls and blows. What are your thoughts guys on her naked?  Show your titties once I showed her titties. No, I didn't say about Amber with the Amber Rose picture. I'm here for the British. I'm not going to lie it because I feel like  Yeah, I wasn't enough is pressure to always be shaven and all of that. Oh my God, but wait do you feel like now that Amber Rose has got here and a vagina your pressure stopped. No, it hasn't. But yeah, there's one positive thing. I took from that. It was just nice that to see myself airbrushed.  At first I thought it was a joke. So I kind of just scroll past it and then when I realized what it was I was I okay, but I wasn't surprised because it's her. Yeah, I mean and I suppose it. She's saying that it was she's doing it under the guise of  Of feminism. That's what this that's what how to empower women. I'm still waiting for someone to explain to me the correlation between nudity and feminism. Yes. Anna Lee, I doesn't Kim K do exactly the same thing. But the thing is the thing that annoys me about this whole empowerment thing is like a nudity is that I think that thoughts. Yeah, and now just using that as a mask to decide to use it as their their excuse me. Yeah. Actually they didn't it's got nothing to do with him.  Moment they're doing it because they look banging and they want everybody sees that's my thing. I think about it. I think there's like I guess there could be a limit in fun ways and new design because it's not appreciating your body and whatever you want to do with your body and whatever whatever where I call bullshit is when you do things for attention and put under labor feminism. Yeah, that's exactly and that is what I think what I but that's what I thought the picture because it she just posted that picture was a blob of look at this picture. My looks hot. I would rate to me that is feminism. Yeah, because it's you  Only feminism me like to me feminism isn't just using the label because you're trying to do something and get with Mary and get away with it and labeling it as feminism feminism is actually doing what the fuck you want to do and owning it and see me when I saw the Muff. I was just like you're posting this because your body looks sick. Otherwise, you wouldn't be coiled up if it was really about feminism you'd have hairy pits. It wouldn't be airbrushed. You wouldn't be covered in baby oil if you're trying to do. Yeah, and it's over sexualized that to me. I  I can't help but link it with attention and I think it's a bit of a slap in the face when people do that because feminism for me all that like getting and I'm not saying that if you want to get your like to me feminism means equality Point Blank period And I think that a woman should be able to do whatever the fuck she wants to do quite frankly. However, I just think that we need to be careful with how we're using the the word and I think it's just becoming Loosely used now and that's that's not because all that make it and they could stuff to me that the  Bottom of the totem pole when it comes to what's important in terms of women's issues. Yeah. I mean, I'm not saying that there isn't a space for it because I think that there is I think that women being able to be proud of their bodies and own their sexuality is important, but it's not as important as some of the issues that we need to tackle FGM sexual abuse rape domestic violence the paint that the pay Gap all of those things for me come first, so I just can't sit here and come down all of that stuff when there's so many other things we need to tackle. That's mine. I just I don't see how  Ow, that picture helped or hindered anything. It just didn't do anything about it. It's like the Kim Kardashian when she broke the internet with the paper magazine cover. There's an x-ray for had to pop. Yeah, but I don't see how it helped or hindered do anything any anything but then at the same tokens I was thinking about it and I was thinking this time to get her money. That's not gonna get anybody but I just thought it was ironic because amberbogie hasn't really been  And the plugs much hasn't been on the shade very much. And then so that's why I links of attention as well because she's a bit quiet for her. Well, because that's like when she gets more interviews and she gets publicity. Yeah Club begins at all about. Yeah such a coincidental that you have been a little bit cold on your end. And now you post this picture in your products, but is there like she like wrote on her chest? Like I don't know. Yeah feminist quote something. Yeah, hold up and my issue.  Yes, screaming feminism says but you're still doing this for the male gaze. Exactly. Yeah, because if it wasn't about Mel Jake to be sexual patriarchy basically, but then at the same time you're fighting against it and I'm not saying that being naked makes you any less of a feminist because I don't  That that's the case. But to me, I just don't understand the correlation. But what I was saying before is that there's different levels of feminism and I think that for Amber Rose like like for me when I think about my issues that I need to do as a woman I'm thinking about the pay I can't even participate gender pay Gap I'm thinking about when I take time off work to go on maternity leave and my going to come back to my job. I'm like, those are the kind of feminist issues. I'm face mask because I'm afraid you on your old that lives in London and I've got a job to go to she's a celebrity that lives on.  Hollywood so her what she's fighting for is going to be very different. Yeah, I mean and but that post a picture. What are you fighting for? She's like is what has she gained from it by publicist. He's fighting for his her right to be sexual but that's but nothing against that because the thing is the reason why I also don't agree with that is because okay feminism means equality but men don't walk around in suit jackets and ties with their dicks out. I'm not I mean, so it's men who walk around with their dicks out and women.  Able to do it then I would kind of get it but that's not the case man don't walk around with suit jacket together. So what is the equality in there wishing that get it? So I don't get what you're fighting for her life from her slot walk the oh, yeah, that's not walk. Is it just to be like which okay fair enough I get it. I get you know, I understand for her own her slutwalk and to own her nakedness. Some people would do that and literally get persecuted and dragged and their families.  I'd be put in danger if they do those type of things. Yeah, because in terms of like only a sexuality as a woman, I am awfully I think that for a very long time woman has been I've said it before I feel that women have made to feel like they can't sex not to be enjoyed is to be endured and they thought their sexuality something that's bad like a girl can be turned on overall National feel like that or like she girl could want to have sex but I'm not I can't I can't voice them. He's because of how Society has made me feel with a woman that I can't own. This is a huge part of me actually. Yeah you too. I can that I can completely  No, whatever but I don't like you said this picture hasn't added or taken away from anything. Nothing for the movement. It's yeah, I don't and what have you enjoyed most of it after got the issues every day. She was like, I just realized that my feminist picture bitch. You just realize you're naked picture. I got deleted that's it. And that wasn't because of feminism that was because nudity is not allowed and I think that's fine. I don't see any problem of Instagram having rules like that. It's on health issues because it's a  algorithm that does it is a like a robot. Basically. It's not a person that sits in a freak every single thing. So there are issues with some things get deleted. They shouldn't be and who say certain words you get deleted in might be wrong, but I think it's totally okay for these platforms to have controls. You don't want to see the headings. You don't want it's something that they could women or naked men is if feminism means equality than what has a nudity got to do with anything. Not only Amber eyes can't oh, yeah. No. No, I know the link of it because nudity the link is clicked over your body is very liberal.  Nobody I but she's definitely the best ways of doing it. That's I've seen it had Natural State. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's what blows my I am at. The numbers are very dim. If I'm completely body on it. I think I think buried em, she's very dim. She takes she takes the titles tries and use it use it as an excuse and then she thinks shit. I now actually have to learn about this shit. So when I do go and do interviews and I have to speak upon it like and it also is she can she was just known for being she's just because  She came on the scene for being a stripper stripper. Yeah and being Kanye and Wiz Khalifa's exit. I think she's taking this feminism thing to give herself a purpose kinds of buffing. I find it a shame that you wouldn't use that platform and all the flat if I had that many followers and if I had such a platform I would like to think that even with us just sitting here doing this. I feel like it's positive. You know, I mean that I would like to think if I had that many followers what I would do to help, you know, what it is with Amber Rose and I think this is might be a fair thing to say is she  Have ration feminism is the things that concern her. Yeah. So what concerns has been called a slut not concerned her is not been able to use her body how she sees flee without being called a slut. So she's doing it for the dates that she think is a good place. Yeah, of course, that's not saying we as people we all do that because I could say this man someone could be like, well, there's girls in Africa the game. But yeah, and it's like yes, that's true. Yes. I feel like she is what we all do. We internalize what I was going to read. So we make it what's around us. And yeah an issue we can see so I guess we can give her  Her that say you're making it about slut-shaming and that's what I'm struggling because that is an aspect of feminism. Did I mean a lot so I don't want to completely dismiss that because it is it is there. Yeah. I mean, he's still getting about doing things outside of sexual assault and domestic violence and rape and all of that stuff is linked. So I do think there's a place for it, but I'm just being self. I can't relate to it. That's not my struggle. That's not my fight. You're not I mean, that's not what I consider to be in like obviously rape and domestic but of course all of  I started at the top but like the slut shaming staff and the the being able to just walk around with your boobs out and your badge out like but nobody can do that. No. Yeah, I don't get it. I think I think the message that she's trying to put across she's just done it in a completely wrong way. I think that that like it would you know what it is. We're talking about it. Yeah, that's it. So yeah. Yeah. Well if it makes people go and Google feminism because Amber Rose said it yeah. So yeah guys, I think she I don't think she's coming from like a bad.  Place. She just we just don't understand it. Maybe she for us what do you think that we look at it differently because it's Herbert and because of the theater had to be so for example, obviously, we know that she was a stripper like she's always in the blogs are being linked to this person and that person and she says she hasn't dated all these people like this one made up stuff. But if it was someone like because I remember Alex I was reading about it in Emma Watson when she got a lot of backlash because obviously she's an out-there feminists like she owns the label, but she is ivy-league-educated, you know, I mean, she's middle class.  Dwight she's really Slim she is known for like being talented. So do you think that there's a difference between it's different depending on who saying I think so if it was like a feminist campaigner and she did a picture. I like that with like hair everywhere will be that great. Yeah, I know whatever not me but I think he intends it has the exact same picture of a different face and says, it's so old up still thinking I don't think it makes it it depends on who it is though. I think because we know these things about Amber. Oh so we can add them.  Onto you can't see it with clear eyes because we know about how we judge her story of Emma. Well, actually I don't see the place for a naked picture on Instagram God. I don't that's just my opinion. I like I've all like like I said it once I'll say it again who doesn't make me come like I'm honestly like there's a lot of things I have my feelings for and she's fired. You know, I should be I should be comfortable being naked and not being shown for it, bro.  No one else that really wants to do that so it's like what is the bleeding but the thing is you think because there's a lot of her fight in her what she's fighting for is like taking the shame out of the word slut. Do you think that's ever gonna happen? No people haven't that hey people have their own definition of a glut and if you don't care about it passed it's not positive. Like let's be honest. It's not positive. You don't want to be called a slut. Let's be honest. You don't want to be able to sleep, but you may have made some mean things, but they already meeting and words meant  Once meant something but it still now it's a term of endearment to some people, you know, it means a lot to me about original meaning I think you know why that can't happen for the word slot because the words law is it's an insult down by patriarchy. Yeah. It's it's an insult for women. Yeah. Yeah, let you know I mean so as long as men are not taking it back on my let making it in certain way. It doesn't matter. I just have to be the ones to change. Yeah, like it's a word that man.  I'm done now by seeing that - maybe it's used by men a lot. Yeah, I was used to for the approval of men we bought and if that means I then to put women down. Yeah, I don't use against other women. Yeah when you said it is to please men. Anyway, if someone you don't care deep down, you don't know the words lot has so many different definition when it's  I like jazz. It means a different thing to everybody else. You know, I mean scary Jesse she's a jezebel. Yeah. Why is yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  Like Jezebel watch what is cool people see? What Whi yeah, they take with bare chest. She's a whole I think it's like what I think ho is like she's a high like a lie. Anyway, she's a hoe because she fucked your man and somebody else, you know, like Melissa said what's actual benefit of not being a jazz at the moment because nothing was hoping I'm not see that happens. It does it benefit of not joking around, you know,  I'm joking. God by not being a jerk. Yeah, that's number one. Number one number one to five. That's it then no and especially depends on what your reputation means to you as well. We talked about all the time. Yeah, that's what mine is that? Yes, I should think. Yeah. I mean it depends what's important to really hmm.  Still maybe I shouldn't be a choice. I think it's completely normal to feel like what is the point of not just doing it you're going to get like you're gonna be not judged for it. But you're going to people are going to judge you anyway, so you might as well just go and do it. So this way you have to have your reasoning why yeah. Yes reason why you doing the reason why you don't feel feelings are not facts that you have feelings about things you go and do it. And then it's like did you actually make yourself feel any better Sheriff access denied because you know what,  I think my high score winning think it's definitely looks like it because I know a lot of good girls like me being one of them not even trying to not pick myself up by in terms of like you can't ye like you've had in your life like you can't do a background check on me and says it won't come out for yeah true. Like, it's just not coming up. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.   They want to go call your Halls what their been about, you know a little bit about you know, they've got to have a background check and you see engagements. Usually every celebrity women. There's so many women that we know they own it like, you know, but yeah, I was about yeah can usually get in rings, but we always equate hoping to not getting married but doesn't it does not true. They need to like for the benefit of that be the Jess. You're praising God.  Literally Rings. Why does it matter? Was it at the moment?  Me know in terms of like so I think I'll see is like wow like okay make and I guess these girls I have more they have more men around them. I guess I guess that's why they win it without you need every opportunity to be able to have they meet more guys are really hot and they get can get guys. I mean, come on. Did you go leaving your always been? You know, this limit the pickings are wider. That's gonna be someone in your life get guys. This is literally what I was saying, like, what do you do? Do you stay at home be a good girl?  Never meet anybody or do you go out and nobody can be out and be a good girl? I am. Yeah, I can definitely be out and be a good girl, but guys that yeah, but you know guys are like, yes, she's at one time and he must have put a promote our take that in. He's a promoter. So he's always in your text is always in your WhatsApp is always in your DMs talk about come here. Come here this night that night so it about last two tickets and he had the cheek to post this picture of a meme of a girl sit in and out how she's wearing shorts in the socks are tired chilling with no makeup on it was  Kind of guy he was and then it was a car not a girl that goes out every week ago and I literally commented this picture. I thought you were my are just by the grace of God. I was like you you that is the club you're going to meet your way and then my she had even asked me about what you're going to everybody can do the same things. I write that in his comments in the my friend Rachel. She tagged him then she was like she was like, how do you how are you supposed to meet these girls if they're always in their house? Yes.   So we're all in agreement. That is Mason is the thing is with that picture. I just think she looks I think about it looks much like but mad if I could look at Ambrose like body-wise. I don't have a problem with the picture. I just don't like the mask of thought the feminist. Yeah, I think it's just a lame excuses for her to post sexy pictures where I was I think that being real feminism would be just saying look I look bomb in this picture and boom have it. So do you think it's like quote unquote someone who didn't have quote-unquote perfect body. I didn't I  Right if I posted that picture whatever you like watch because I have you seen that I've seen a lot of on Twitter recently. I've liked girls that post nepotism in bikini bodies and be like, yeah, this is what my body is. I feel sick feel sick or when I got that. Nice like your mom. I love I wish I had the confidence to do that. Yeah. Yeah. I know what that's I am a very very confident person same and aside from not wanting to have sex because I'm trying to live a be as pure as I can. My body's not there for me.  And I tell people I don't like but I look like shit. They killed my mate. I find it's more like that now since I've had a baby because I everyone used to say to me. I had two guys say to me. I never slept with him or anything, but he was like, you can always told baby moms because of her.  Stomach the red and I was like, I've got stretch marks. So I've always been like oh my God, if I'm naked like Yahoo! Obviously know I have a child, but it's like, you know, very apparent. Yeah. I have a child because you know the loose skin stretch marks, etc. Etc. But yeah, I've had a few guys say to me like body shamed me because I've had a child like you have a baby. What's good? What's your what you shouldn't wear that or I know just been like  yeah, you look better before, you know, I think that guys that bought after having babies are completely stupid and uneducated not to not understand what a woman but it is really sad though, because you know, like you see people that are just like not even people that have had kids people in general that have stretch marks in the like, you know, embrace the tiger stripes like, you know that this is my body that had but if somebody yeah, yeah caught I grew a human being and what not and I did something amazing, but  Somebody gave me the money tomorrow to make my stretch marks disappear. I would absolutely do it. Do you think that guys that have a warped and not even just guys at young people as well? I have a warped perception because in my celebrity yes, you know, like literally like celebrity moms. I have a baby and literally a month later. This body is snatched their stomach is fly and that is not reality. I actually really hate so much money for weeks after I gave birth to cataleya to get back to a size 10 12, and you know what?  When I actually researched it and I went to the doctors for a checkup. He was like, do you understand what your body's gone through internally for a year? It's been changing and adapting to everything and now you want to go and go and strain yourself for what to please other people weren't really a truly. It was really to please other people. Yeah, I don't feel comfortable even now in my body. So there are some things I wear and I'm just like I don't think anybody that can shame someone like okay I get it like  You've just if because there were some people that had they've got a ten-year-old and I'll be like well, I just had a baby, right?   Sweet to me like I've always had comments from other people on my body, but I didn't used to look at my body. I didn't used to think any of these things. It just it was just I just walked around like I just live my life like you just was my body with my vehicle. But I've always had even from school like people making comments about me friends saying, oh you should lose some weight. You should put some weight on like always changing their opinion based on like how they felt that moment. And it's so weird to me and you start to internalize those things and they are maybe I should maybe she's it's really  Hard to kind of ignore what people say about you because I would be part. If no one ever said anything to me about my body. I would be perfectly happy always other people's stuff. Like I know what my flaws are in it. I'm not going to sit and tell them because you would never know because I feel like I know how to cover them. But I know I know what they are. I know. Yeah, I know that my body is far from perfect. I know I've got it hello work to do. But but I just don't like to wear that on externally, you know, I mean like I'm obviously confident and I am confident but I  I know what I need to work on but I remember one time, you know, I was in the club. This is ages ago and I went to a ray with this is when I was Abed and so because I was a bed I had like I would never do this now, but I've gone to KFC and boxed before the right. Yeah, this is Ben favorites or Tennessee fried chicken tonight, but box a whole bucket. Yeah with my girls and then I went straight to the club after this is  when I was a bad guy was wearing flats in the club and Gene. Wow, I know I know judge me later. Anyway, I was whining with a guy yet and then I could hear him talking and I was probably giving him the wicked is right how you gonna get the number and he was at know my know Billy's busy.  Why are you still here? I was getting harder. I was got my the bottom kind of husband.  When he said what he said I could feel myself sucking my believe but you know what that thing of sucking I never used to do that thing of suck in your belly is tight is tiring people that dress not like I just for what I think my body should be it. I don't like I don't overdo myself like whatever in it, but this time I must have felt like my belly was flat wherever I walk up sober.  I hate that that's because I could never wear clothes. They were wearing high-waisted that minimum have it or not. And I know and the thing is I don't even know for sure your combat. You feel bad about something. It's Yeah Yeah from you know, your high waisted jeans have literally saved my life. I know somebody that said that  I met me when I was very very very young. So I was the size 6 when I was younger when I was about 16 and I used to love wearing hipsters. Like, you know, they'll just be on your hips and you'd wear a nice little girl. Yeah jeans lay on your hips and now they don't come lower than your boobs. I like they do they really do.  They are but listen, if you told me in 2003, they're too big in how many ever years time you could be wearing high-waisted jeans. I would have been like are you mad Neva these Colombian jeans. I'm never coming off of me the ones with no pockets on the back never walk around with those and literally my zip if the zip was any any longer than my pinky. I wouldn't buy them. Yeah, cause that's something that I would have to shave where the gene was.  My body isn't where I want it to be but saying that I'll sit there and complain and I still won't do anything about it. My what my frustration is, basically when I see you.  And I quote unquote like bigger than me and like they have the confidence to wear things that I'm like I can never wear. Yeah, and I think they look amazing in it. And that's what the fuck is wrong with you and why have you got in your head that you can't wear this you can't wear this because what I think that there's confidence and I think but I do think that not everything is for everybody though. Should I be like even someone that quote unquote has the perfect body? There's something that they can't wear. Yeah. I mean because you can be really Slim's you can be really Slim. Yeah and have an amazing body and have no boobs. Yeah, and if you've got like really  Ali small breasts than you probably shouldn't wear like like trying to cleavage but the thing is I think you can and should wear whatever you want. It just depends on how good you think it looks and how you feel about. Yeah, like, you know, I'm making some things look like literally I like I said, there's a lot of things I see them lie. You look fine. You know my Lane. I know what I should and shouldn't be wearing but sometimes I do go over it. Like I'm like if I think it depends on the day, sometimes I get really really excited. And so, you know, maybe that morning.  I've not eaten bread and I'm like, I feel really really flat then it just goes downhill after that and it's always because the hunger takes over and I'll be okay and then it's not until I can't fit into something that I you know, when you have a vision of how you're going to look in the in something and then it doesn't work. I'm just like wow my mother does it then I'm not going to because some of the girls that I work with. Yeah, they are so discipline like they literally they eat for fuel. We don't like join I can never  see myself go. I really want a salad. Like I really just want you know, I think it's a cultural thing as well because I've grown up on rice do not like chili con carne.  Miss glassons juice just have ice. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah science partner called it coconut like it's actually mad. I really love I think I think I'm bigger than what I am you do. Are you coming? Yeah in size for yeah, and I'm like, those are my best friend always held because when I go and buy stuff or if I buy stuff online, I always tend to go bigger than small arm because I don't ever think. Oh, maybe it'll be a bit too big. I always think maybe that's why the small for your shit. I need to he's a way to smoke.   A shocking shops anymore. Like when I say, yeah.  Yeah, and I bought like this shirt first with the shirt was too small this gaping like you can see all my bra is a hot-ass mess and it was depressing because it was a large as well as I went into the shop. And I said I never shop in shock that you know, they have the front room. They have their back everything. Everything is my wig was bloated. I was a hot mess. I was just I was so upset.  So down I called. I called my brother. I'm getting a personal trainer tomorrow. Okay, fuck it. I'm doing this to this day where the PT R. I need a boyfriend. That's a personal trainer.

spotify:episode:6gJAMyIWcgiNV6I8wX9Bxp	Hello, everyone. It is Bryson and a fell here Return of the champ. Shut the fuck up. Oh my God, he's just really pretty. We'ii. Just were we everyone everyone else gave up everyone else gave up. I kept it. He gave up Alonzo. I always kept it open for him.  Everyone gave up this, you know even be I was like, you know, Josh board is probably not going to be on the team not putting any faith in Josh board and then all of a sudden we were like, nope screw this we're ready to get our hearts broken Joshua's going to eat that snack every night every night Josh Gordon tweets. I've been tweeting about Josh Gordon been thinking about him. I was just came home. I'm literally on the road home from Tennessee Titans Patriots joint practices.  I've been thinking about Josh Gordon and how long would use just throw into gonna cross you see whatever his name is and that guy. Okay, no fuck contrl. Oh, no. No, he has a family he has a family. He's a nice guy no gutters and nice guy gun was a nice guy. He's like my tweets God. I love gone here. I love Gunner practice squad, Josh Gordon. No, yeah. Okay. Yep.  Josh Gordon is back. Josh. Gordon is back and we're going to we're going to record a little you know, recap with a Patriots Titans practices along with week. One preseason along with the week two preseason prove you after this, but right now it is free Josh Gordon Tom. He is free what? Okay Lawns it how many yards is going to have he's gonna play 19 games right? Like he's gonna have at least twenty three hundred yards in the 1923.  Here, it's okay. He's gonna play he's I agree. He's gonna happen that he might be MVP. I've actually I'm looking at I'm looking at the odds right now and it doesn't seem that crazy to me 1001, but whatever I'm going with it.  I I'm hey, I'm mulling I'm all-in I am all in here's the thing with Josh Gordon. Okay, if you're amazing and beautiful, okay? Yes. Yes, but if you're half in on Josh Gordon then get out get out go. Fuck you go. Fuck. Yo. Fuck you. I don't go just just go. Okay.  The full experience which is the week one key plays well called 45 plays. He still using himself into shape. You know, I'll fill Dorset places many snaps. You got some Targets on third down Brady maybe throws a job. No, stop talking about filbert said fuck that guy. Fuck that guy. He's getting cut but but let's but here is okay. Okay here is my point is like the first couple weeks. It may be they use them in you'll be able  a full-time Starter by like week three weeks for and if you're just not all in then you're missing out you're missing it out. I mean if he if he gets ripped away once again, if he gets ripped away from Alonzo and you and you were prepared for that you did not live because for the weeks he is in he is special special special player special.  Okay, Alonzo. I just want to say that josh board. He already knows our Playbook. He's ready. He's probably in shape like why would he not play all the snaps week one? What do you what do you mean?  Yeah, I'm leaving you come in. He's come you miss all of training camp alongside. Okay. Wait, no stop just stop right there. Stop.  He has at least the preseason has a couple weeks and most important weeks of the preseason Hobie there that like you just said the media won't be there. He's going to be amazing. You don't have to rely on NICU Harry to be amazing anymore. You don't have to do that. You don't have to start Jacoby Myers. You don't have to worry about that. Now you have Edelman you have Edelman Josh Warden back and the third receiver is going to be in his role. It's fine. That's the band the third receiver exact. Yep.  Whoever did this makes it perfect because Josh Gordon is one of the best is one of the best receivers in the entire NFL outside receive a pass when he's healthy and he's going to be he's going to be doing that kind of stuff and he is going to be amazing and adleman candida to and playing the slot and that's what I really like about this. This is going to be the underrated part. We've talked about it Edelman making his transition to the stop playing outside as much roll and I  I don't totally agree. Yes, because you have you had a few Harry keep Josh they wanted to keep him outside. Okay, but now you have but now you have nikhil Harry and Josh Gordon who can play outside and do animals Unstoppable inside. Why would you not just put them inside the Forum or not Sam? Okay. This is what I'm saying before Joy not onl Min is a 48% inside guy for his career. Now, let's make them a 65% inside guy not.  Quite Welker yet. But let's let's put them in there have Josh Gordon NICU Harry the rest of those guys man the outside and let joy in ottoman just go to work and his later portion of his career.  Yeah, I the Patriots wanted to do the opposite with Edelman this off. I don't like that. They try I mean they tried signing home fries. They tried signing Beasley.  They wanted to move them. They want to keep them outside. They want to guys kind of play that and it beats me man. He why maybe because it doesn't that make more sense to just put them in the takes a beating in the slot more than he does outside.  That's just a fact. I don't know. I mean take more hits over the middle and do playing outside. It doesn't really matter. The point is however you put Edelman. Gordon is 1/2.  And I actually would tend to the film Cattlemen's more the one than War. Yes, Gordon might be more traditional weird might be more of a traditional like X receiver. Number one type guy but Edelman is really the fulcrum of the offense is still the most important player on the offense outside of Brady. I think that almonds you're like nominal number one receiver in any case Edelman one Gordon to Borden one atom into those guys were perfect in their roles Gordon. Is it top to type caliber receive?  Edelman is a top two caliber receiver on a good offense.  I don't I don't think Jacoby Myers. Is that right? I filled her said it's certainly not that and they kill Harry hopefully becomes that eventually maybe he develops into it by the end of the year. But as of now, he wasn't even running with the starters and training camp. So now you just you have certainty for however long Gordon lasts and hopefully again, it's most of the Season you have certainty in terms of your tattoo guys at receiver and then all the guys think just thrown against the wall.  See what sticks right your your Myers your hairy your Dorset. Your Maurice Harris was going to be out for a while. He has like a calf injury. I think you're bad scenarios your Gunners. You're done trolling means all those players. They're not now competing for like they are shaking their Rita 5. They're shaking in their shoes. You're all shaking in your shoes. The NFL Braxton various. We're gonna race Harris girl shaking legs are shaking. They're competing to be  We are competing to be numbers 3 4 and 5 on the depth chart and the be situational players in this offense. But now it's perfect. It's perfect you have at home and you have Gordon and in certain situations you put Myers in there you put Dorset in there you put Harry in there. You don't have to rush Harry in and overwhelm him after he was limited for most to Camp. It's perfect. He's here and he's perfect and he's Josh Gordon and I  He's gonna be walking out on the field with his with the cut-offs. He's gonna have a cut off of inside steps are going to be freaking huge. He's going to be very handsome. He's yeah, it's the NFL should be very afraid.  Tom Brady would Josh Gordon for 16 games. And by the way, it's already looked amazing. Tom Brady looked amazing this week by the way. Like I'm just imagining imagining Tom Brady into those joint practices with a really good team. But with Josh Gordon said instead of gunnard, you could be Myers, but it's a instead of fucking done trial and then with Julian Edelman instead of Gunner and with nikhil Harry instead of various, but it what would you do there?  It's just that this is the illegal.  Here's a guy here's  oh, I love you so much Josh Gordon. I'm actually I mean, I don't know how most Patriots fans feel but I mean really smart ones would say that Josh Gordon. Okay, Josh Gordon is a better player than Gronk and I'll take you out for dinner right now back. Yes your of a girl. Yes. Yes. Yeah, I'll take I'll take my Josh Gordon because he's just gonna casually draw the best corner on the team every single week and draw draw double coverage large Corner. Yes. Yes, and then yes, oh my gosh in the kill.  You get to work against the threes in the fours. Exactly. Exactly. It's perfect. It's perfect. And you know what? You know what?  Like facing the reality of this I've alluded to it, even when we've talked about the possibility of him coming back now that he's back the possibility exists. And if you go by history the probability exists that he won't be best off her season. So let me get to my point. Okay last year Josh Gordon was on the Patriots and playing from week for two week 15 They don't serve.  Use the regular season if he's not on the team for those weeks, it's Josh Gordon this year last until like mid-november then you know what he helped. You got through mid-november anything you got from Josh. Gordon is a plus. That's it. That's how you have to do this if they if they feel like they need a receiver at the deadline and Josh Gordon is still on the team. They should still go out and make your move like they were trying to for Demaryius Thomas and golden.  Late last year. No, no way. Oh my gosh. I forgot about it. Yes, that's what I'm saying. But look, however many games Josh Gordon last is a good thing for the Patriots. It's a good it's a good thing. It's a good thing and we should take it. We should be grateful for it every single Sunday Monday Thursday Wednesday practice every time he's on the field. We should be grateful for it. We shouldn't count on it last.  The whole season if they were planning to make a move for a receiver. They shouldn't stop looking for one. But if Josh Gordon can help you get through a month a week two weeks three months two months the entire fucking season. It's a good thing.  I want an I just want to know what Tom Brady's reaction just was I would love to just be there to see what Tom Tom Brady's like. Oh my God guys. I have a I have a guy who actually looks like an NFL player to throw the ball to holy cow.  Braxton Barrios is not my receiver one anymore. That is happening. I just listen, let's just let's also set the stage and set the stage. Remember how member it's just very ironic that last year when Joshua word, please the team again, I was actually in my car if you remember I was in my car we were close. I guess. I remember very weak very sad, but now bury the 2018 Patriots week.  Buried the 2018 Patriots on that place. It was a tough scene. Basically, we are emotional. That's okay. But now we are we're in we're in our cars. Well, I'm losing my credit cards doesn't matter Josh Gordon back and  Just I just wish I don't wish because it would break their eardrums. I just wish you all could hear Alonzo and I just scream that each other for 2 minutes and like Pete that yeah, we're just tweeted that just tweeted that just tweeted. Sorry. Sorry that just tweeted. What did he say that just tweeted?  Nothing, I'm Josh Gordon. Okay, nothing on Jeff Gordon. You have his notifications on you freak.  Yeah, oh my God. Anyway, I'd like other cars around me were probably like yeah, we're calling the police. We don't know what you're up to over there in that car. But whatever it is that made you scream like that. We're calling the cops on you and you're going to jail Bryson NFL that's what just basically happened in the car.  Bruce and I felt I was on the toilet. I was on the toilet. I just had a huge huge lunch. I was on the toilet with my pants down. I was taking a shit. I was taking a shit and I got this i got this I started screaming screaming. Oh my god, when I saw it, I mean, this is probably the best our of my 2019 so far.  Maybe the Patriots did win the Super Bowl. No. No, I'm not exaggerating. This was the best this last hour was the best our of my 2019 because I just got back from Nashville. Just hit my just hit the state where I live just across the board into the greatest 18 United States played Country Roads, and then all of a sudden Here Comes Josh board just like riding on a unicorn into my life like the most amazing man second to only Tom Brady.  By the way, did you see my picture of me riding on Tom? Brady has to get on the wall at Ya BB ya did. Yes, I did that. Yeah did that I did that was pretty cool. But now I'm sad because I wish I want to I should have put free Jocelyn.  That's figure thing this whole time. It's been well, actually, I just want to apologize everyone. I'm very sorry for the lack of free Josh Gordon son. This is what happened. This is it was true. It was pathetic. It was it was this is yes it is. Yes it is. But here's what happened. I was we were out we were out drinking and I had my credit cards in my pocket my wallet separate and my credit cards fell out of my pocket and I started and I was drinking a lot and I just we got home at all.  10:30 I didn't have my credit cards practice was the next morning. It was just it was a very tough scene for me. We were late in the morning. We had an early breakfast. I was going to just literally stopped law greens within the line at practice was a lot longer than the day before. So we just kind of had to get in there for one hour. I missed the first 10 mins of Praxis suck. I wanted the free just for the sun's very badly. I'm very disappointed but I still might get the free Josh Gordon tattoo that  If you last the season in the Patriots win the Super Bowl, you got the tattoo. We got the tattoo. We all get the same tattoo and then that also has to get the tattoo and weep weep. Dad. Why do you want Mike Lombardi to get a Josh prejudge boarding tattoo? That would be weird. Okay. Okay, Emma.

And these and judging by and I'm not sure if your notifications are crazy, but judging by mine the entire like I just I could not see anything in my notifications because literally everyone was like free Josh Gordon Josh Gordon free blah blah blah. Oh my gosh. It was it's crazy the Patriots fans. Love Josh board and as they should yes Josh. Gordon is back. We wanted Josh Gordon on the Patriots for so long for so long.  He came into our lives. He was amazing. He disappeared. They won the Super Bowl we forgot about them and then and then on said we were just here at a bar in our hometown and there he was again and we walked up to him and he was just still the same handsome guy and he came home with us and he loved us and we loved him.  No, hopefully he doesn't leave in the middle of the night. Now. He's not going to because guess what we do we chained him to the bed. I'm not even kidding. He's big on family and this and that and this and that. Do you want to win your seven Super Bowl? If you do just keep trash Gordon in your house. Just call them yourself or like that. I don't care what Gizelle wants Michael. I don't care.  Don't care who gives a shit. I don't care what she wants.

Yes, an absolute great development for the Patriots. They were extremely thin at wide receiver with Harris going down Dorset hurt or door. Stink. I should say hopefully he's cut now, but yeah, not really much more to say just an absolutely Dynamic player that did big things for the Pats and the 10 games. He was there.

Let's Jump Right In  So I feel like if you're listening to this, you probably want to become a network marketing machine, right? So I'll just tell you that probably the most paid skill set aside from driving to events, which we can also talk about on the podcast for instance. That is you need to master how to sponsor how to build how to manage and how to grow your business and all I'm really saying is that yeah, your network marketing company might have great products. You might be an incredible retailer. You might be able to sell your face off and I'll tell you right now.  That's all good and fine personal experience. I personally sold last year in 2018 $980,000 of products just me. That's pretty crazy. By the way. Thank you because I don't know a lot of you ordered for me and I love you guys. Appreciate you. It's way cooler that our team in our first year in business sold over 20 million dollars. What does that mean? That means residual income that means I can take vacations and get paid that means I have a business that is sustainable and has leverage and my  family will be able to have and it has Legacy behind it. So you cannot leverage and capture the benefits of true residual income and truly network marketing and grow your business. If you're not learning how to recruit this cannot be just about sales and that is coming from quite frankly the person aka me Jesse Lee Eric worry, the basically, you know, Godfather of network marketing says is world-class in achieving customers, by the way. Sorry, you know how it is. Mom life will be has an opinion and I actually was told that  She barks like this. She's scaring off coyotes. So she's scaring off coyotes. I'm being loud. She's deaf. She can't hear me. So we're just gonna roll. So the power of network marketing is truly in your ability to build your system build your team and then throughout that team be able to you know sell and move more products. So to be able to succeed in network marketing, you've got a massive out of network marketing recruiting and we've got to convert your customers and your prospects into business Builders. Now, some people are lucky you've got  Got a ton of friends. You got a ton of family, you know, some of you are just naturally charismatic and you can recruit basically at will however, you know, that's not necessarily normal obviously, right? So let's discuss some powerful techniques for mess of growth. First of all, this is honest. I hope you're taking notes for not taking notes. What even are you doing? Take notes get out of pain pull over on the side of the road. Do what you got to do. Let's roll. First of all, you've got to make a decision you have to decide here.  Now I am going to become recruiting Superstar. Everything has to start with a decision. You have to make the decision you're going to master this you have to make the decision. You're not going to give up and I'll tell you there are some of you thousands of you listening to this and you are going to give up but for those of you who aren't gonna give up. I'm talking to you make the decision to master recruiting and not give up. Make up your mind to learn make up your mind to develop skills. Make up your mind to understand that this takes time. Excuse me.  I was in Vegas. My lungs are all jacked up. Make up your mind to pass your fear of talking to people and come out of your shell. Like I'm telling you. Yes, it's scary. But you're doing a massive disservice to the world to yourself to your family by not talking to people I guarantee there are people right here listening to this podcast right this second who you need this and you know moms were sitting on the park bench at the park that are frustrated and they needed and they need an extra income, you know business owners whose businesses are actually going on.  This they need you. So make up your mind to get past your fears of talking to people and get out of your shell your decision to have a better life should be more significant than your fears and insecurities around recruiting and even if you're an introvert, make up your mind to make it a priority and do it whenever you choose introversion is not Annex is not a reason. It's an excuse right? Like for those of you who don't know. I am not the extroverted person. You think I am I am introverted. I like to stare at a wall. I just did an event on Saturday.  It took me until about 4 p.m. Sunday to even leave the hotel room to get food. I was so high. Okay, so make up your mind. Your introversion is not an excuse. There are plenty of books on Charisma get a personality. Okay. I love you guys saying it out of love. So tip number one make a decision. My next tip is you need to develop a recruiting mindset. So if you're in an MLM and you're listening to this that means to me that something drew you to the network marketing profession. Okay. It could have been the product your company sells.  All's it could have been the compensation plan. It could have been friendships. It could have been the ability to work with awesome people. It could have been the personal development whatever. Okay, it is enough motivation. I'm telling you whatever the reason was.  Just to develop a network marketing recruiting mindset. Okay, you need to understand you're no longer an employee. It is not your fault or it is not your up one's fault. If you're not successful it is your fault. Okay, it is your fault. If you're not as successful as you want just like if you make a million dollars, the last thing you want your upline to do is go oooooh develop that person know you have to develop an entrepreneurial mindset. You have to be ready to approach me with your opportunity without fear and you have to decide not to be apologetic about it.  You need to be brave, you know, you're trying to share a great gift with somebody you need to know that you need to know that there's more to this life than struggling then not being able to put your kids in the school's you want to put them in to not be able to have the clothes. You want the car. You want the house you want the life you want? Okay. So share your gift. If you ever want to be an entrepreneur a series on turn or not. I want to burn or I'm going and you want to work from home, you know in your heart of hearts that never marketing is an excellent way to start because you can listen to all the business podcast in the world, okay?  These people are having to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to start things up. That's crazy. That's not network marketing. It's not so I need you to basically realize that network marketing. Yes, it is selling and yes, it is recruiting. But yes, it is selling your products. And yes, it is selling yourself really but it also involves prospecting. It also involves recruiting it also involves training it also occur.  Involves follow-ups, it also involves accounting and so much more event planning whatever else you can make it a a career that pays you full-time money. If you develop that mindset that's required to invest your time and energy into it. Okay. All right. I need to get some of my protein shake one sec. Okay, my next tip if you want to become a network marketing recruiting Superstar is you need to make friends.  Listen to episode 42 this podcast. If you are not a likable human, I'm telling you somebody have a hard time recruiting could you've got the personality of a clam? Okay, you have no personality is ridiculous. You're not nice people. You don't smile to people you don't get no people you don't ask questions. You are is all about yourself. Listen to me successful recruiters and every six and seven figure earner. I know a network marketing has one major thing in common for sure. And that is we make as many friends as possible before they ever start being successful in our business.  Because making friends and building relationships in your business with Pete pulp is a people relationship business is essential because it'll help raise your level of awareness. So what do you need to do? You need to get your little pretty face on Facebook and you need to go to the events Tab and you need to go under events in your area and you need to go to networking events. If I go in Frisco, Texas, there are which is where I live. There are literally dozens this week. It's ridiculous. There's no excuse why you don't have friends. There's no excuse why an  Market in 2019. You aren't out in public making friendships join groups find Hobbies join those groups find activities join those groups go to networking things fine humans so you can build relationships with them. And if you're bad at doing that the only way to get good at doing that is by doing it just like anything so you can do this through various social media platforms. You can make friends. You can do it at your favorite restaurant with the waitress. You can do whatever networking events and I'm telling you this is very important, please listen making friends does not mean recruiting and prospecting all  Love them because it allows you to work through people and find referrals. So what I'm telling you to do is make friends interact share add value get them to know like and trust you and get them attracted to what you're doing like today. I just added a realtor as a friend. Well, what do you think? She's gonna do I didn't talk to her about what I do really except for I told her I'm a Network marketer and she was like, oh it's so cool. But like I could ever be good at network marketing. I'm like, well, if you're good at real estate, you could be really good at working. But okay and she said  She basically said whatever he was going to say, never mind. Oh, yeah, I added her on Facebook. And so for me, I know what's going to happen. She's gonna go on my page. He's gonna poke around see if Jessica, he's the real deal. She's gonna get attracted to me. She will start asking me questions like mark my words on that one. Okay? Okay. All right. My next tip is develop positive daily habits again. I'm sorry. I apologize for lucky. She's getting rid of the coyotes again develop positive daily habits. So I need you to strive to develop positive daily habits every single day.  This could be your VMO. This could be connecting with one or two people. This could be going to a networking event. This could be going live on Facebook. This could be follow-up. This could be whatever I don't care what it is, but you're positive daily habits are super important. You need to call people you need to message people. You need a voice message people being a comment on their posts and social media you need to interact on their Instagram stories. You need to let people know you care or you or or that they exist to you. Okay, I highly suggest you look you see get carried up side.  Out of favor, which come way down. Okay. I was just going to say I think a positive habit would possibly be introducing your business opportunity or even products to at least one person in your network a day. And if your network is small what did I tell you to do? I told you to go make some friends. Okay people. Okay. Alright. So this continues though. I want you guys to have more personal development. I want you to have a more positive mindset. I want you to have more in Your Arsenal to get over the hard things. Okay.  You can achieve that through what webinars yes trainings. Yes audible. Yes podcast. Yes events. Yes articles books Facebook lives, whatever anything that will help your personal growth and expand your vision zoom trains for your team. Whatever. There's only one word. I can use to describe it. You need to become a slave to those positive habits. If you want to become a network marketing recruiting Superstar, you need to be consistent. The only people I know that can recruit like me and there aren't many of us. You are consistent. You are a slave to your positive habits because  Telling you there's no such thing as Perfection but progress is perfection, right? You will change your business and you will change your life if you keep a positive daily habits, and also it's like armor like some of you really need to be developing your minds because you need to have an armor around you for negativity. Okay. Alright. My next tip is all the top recruiters. I know are just monsters about being prepared. Okay, they're prepared with their video links. They're prepared with their business.  Cards are prepared with trials to sell their paired with you know, Facebook groups Instagram. Whatever doesn't matter like my phone is never dead. Okay, my phones do not die. They are landline until I have to go somewhere portable chargers, whatever why because if I find somebody who might be interested in my business if I talk to a human which happens every single day then I need to be ready. I need to be ready to share with my new friends. I need to be able to connect them to a video. I need to be able to sell to them right away on a trial website. That is a habit of a master network marketing recruiter. They're always prepared it.  Matter they know what they know and they're ready to sell to you at all times. So if you want to be recruiting Superstar, you better start getting prepared. You cannot tell people. Oh, you'll follow a know you now right now. Okay. Alright, my next tip. Actually.

They want to know about the trip to Maui. I'm taking the team on they want to know all the stuff. Okay, my next tip if you want to come in network marketing.  Superstar is you have to listen and ask questions which ironically is what I said on episode 42 about how to make people like you you need to shut your mouth and listen to ears one mouth. Right? I know it sounds weird talk like coming for me because I'm talking into a phone to myself and we're not even having a conversation but I feel like we're having a conversation. Okay, listen and ask a question. So when you're talking and selling that can be really hard, right the only way you're gonna be able to understand what your prospects need is by  By listening and asking questions and a lot of network marketers, especially the novices they don't listen they don't ask the right questions. They're so focused on the things that matter to them like if the Compensation Plan matters to them they're talking about bonuses for an hour and a half or maybe they're really excited about products in the person only cares about how long the business been open for. Okay, like just be quiet. Ask questions say what questions can answer for you. It's a really good script to ask people and then just answer those questions. Don't answer anything else. And if you start asking the right questions you're going to get  Understand people better you're going to be able to have a better stronger approach to introducing your business opportunity and you're going to go to recruit more people. However, I don't know 99.9% Network marketers don't do that. They just talk over people and spin and try to give their best razzle-dazzle. That doesn't work in 2019. I promise you. Okay. It's not gonna work in 2020 or 21 or whatever you listen to this and three the year 3000 will work either. So close your mouth open your ears and ask questions. My next tip is like really I  I need this is the one okay, like we got some good ones. This is the one enthusiasm. Why do you think all these amazing humans? Join our team? Why do you think they sign up on a Jesse Lee? I'll tell you why because network marketing recruiting Superstars are always active and always enthusiastic. Okay, they are pumped up. They are vibrant their energetic. They have positivity all around them. Like, who do you know? Who's the most enthusiastic person your life some of your brother like my God, it's you awesome. If it is me screenshot it putting it again story. I just wanna know.  Of course people want to join our team. They go that girl is so nice. She is so happy. She's so kind she's always bubbly and joyful and excited and has a spirit around her like I'm obsessed. I want to be around her. I want to join your team like Heller, I don't blame you you're surrounded all day long with Negative Nancy naysayers all over the place, but their poo poo attitudes and their grouchy faces and their frowns and like, oh man, it's not good. Of course people want to join our team. Do you hear what I said to always active like they want people they can see always being happening.  I want to follow and be recruited by people who've got the Instagram stories to prove that their life is good or their Facebook is active and engaged and enthusiastic and energetic and vibrant. Okay, that's what people are attracted to people are not attracted to negative and negativity. People are not attracted to low energy people. They're just not in this day and age, they're not so be enthusiastic. I want to think about that most enthusiastic person, you know, like you probably will smile on your face and that's the kind of spirit. You've got to have when you're a Network marketer. So the people  Are comfortable with you so that people smile when they're around you and some people want to join your team. Okay, and then my next tip made my last tip, I don't know I might ramble, you know, this is the Jesse Lee show after all I'd like to ramble so my favorite hobby just kidding. You've got to be a bigger dreamer, you know, some of you have a hard time recruiting because your goal was to recruit to people like to make $1,000 a month. Well, that's not gonna work. You've got to have Big Dreams one of the best and biggest attributes of anybody. I know who  Is making six seven eight figures a year is they have huge dreams and they nurture them every day like it's not about that. It's done. It's about the journey. It's about being better. It's about dreaming. It's about Visions about seeing things before they actually exist. Okay and stay steadfast when there's adversity is around. Like I know that stuff is not easy. I know some of you are going through real traumas. I know some of you are struggling right now I get that. We all have struggles in our lives not to diminish anything you're going through. Okay, but I'm gonna tell you right now your  Is be bigger than the stress you need to think about outrageous dreams of massive success huge goals million dollar homes the cars of your dreams the team of your dreams have a bigger vision and a bigger game plan because if you came into something and you were like I've never recorded before and then you recruit 50 people you're gonna be like, oh my gosh, I'm done that was bigger than I ever dreamt before re set your goals decide to be faster and stronger and make up your mind to recruit more and grow exponentially. What was tip number one? Make up your mind. We're make up your  And to recruit more and grow exponentially. Okay, and then I'm just going to tell you right now no one's born a leader. So on top of all that stuff like you need to be you need to develop your leadership skills. Okay, you need to show people your leadership skills. You need to show people what you're doing in your business that will help start build momentum because you can use lip service all day say you're going to be consistent say you're going to do these things say you're going to recruit you've got to do it in then you gotta show it.

And the movies is when Harry gets it learns to the wizard one cut so magical to the beginning of his journey to because some crazy guy that's really a giant guy comes into his house tell this is a wizard says he's to come his magical school and walk through a wall to get there. Anyway, okay, I'll come he has no Christian I love Hagrid I usually like but query what's up. Yeah, I mean no should be more cautious.

You're not a little bit about any questions. Yeah, that that's that's Harry. That's Harry for you. Okay. So one of my favorite Parts, okay, you guys might be like a little what is wrong with you for this but I like one Harry and Voldemort are fighting in the seventh book or movie because there are lots of deaths like Dhabi and Fred and George. Yes won't be you know in the seventh book when everyone died. I like to adopt he died and I can friend died. I mean, yes and other liked one Loop and dye dye lines all those from all those people died.  I like it too, but I like it because I'm sad that I liked it because I cried and it made me feel like I was really into the books and it showed how much I feel like I'm a part of Harry Potter's Journey. You can't have a battle at answer the handshake twice. Um, all those books. Yeah. So all these books that like don't kill off their character.

One of my favorite Parts is I really liked in the fourth book Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire when Voldemort cat-like took carry, when at the end of the book with Cedric and for a moment there when he was like it was pretty scary. I thought that I don't know if he was going to die or not. I don't know if the other books were about her mind your honor Hogwarts. I didn't know if he was going to die when they were battling because Harry wasn't that old then.  Wasn't as you know, yeah strong also, the other books were called Harry Potter and well, of course because it's Harry Potter, but I just didn't know I felt like I was really scared and I really liked how I was like glue to the book like what is going on like and also you don't they know Baltimore's gonna die because yeah older more in the Sorcerer's Stone.

spotify:episode:7LBJuMprDt6nN8lWZhw1ZN	Welcome to the Leaky nib a podcast about pens. This show is not suitable for work because swearing is encouraged. It's like a Pinchot after dark but it's a podcast. I'm Kat palmisano and I'm John Fela. Welcome to the leakiness episode 14 14 with special guest a bee pollen der Wille. Lemur. What's up lady? Oh nothing just a little. Time off work for the holidays here recording and doing some lemur Ops things lie Rob's things. Yeah, you know, it's because you're the operations manager. This is true. She is she's my girlfriend Abby and are she's our only read the little intro. How about that? So I have to read it. I don't know who you are. You're a board certified Critical Care pharmacist and put that in there the Lemur ink operations manager and wellness and  Ambassador these are all true statements today. I'm only doing a couple of those things. Hopefully no pharmacist move today. Not today. Not today while you guys are talking about drugs before I came in here. So, ah, yeah. Sure. Happy New Year everybody. This is our first episode of 2020. I hope you all are ready for the years to come freaking out Mia. I can't believe it's 2020.  It's weird. I remember Y2K and how everything was gonna shut down and it was gonna be dark and we all need to start prepping and now turn your computer off before midnight and now it's been 20 years that makes me feel really old. Oh, yes same same. I don't know why he was going to destroy itself. Oh, wow. That's so weird. That's 20 years ago. Yeah your old John your own balls. So Abby we ask everyone. Yes.  What was your radioactive spider bite in depends? John Feelin that was it. So yeah, John Feelin brought a disposable pilot fountain pen to our first date and he uses that apparently as a litmus test for all the ladies to see how they respond to it. So I repaired responded positively responded positively to it, but I was also like one little thing away from being  Involved in a fountain pens in general just based on my personality. So I responded well to it. And here we are. It's been a couple years later and now I'm leaner. The Lemur ops manager you got promoted very fast. I did get promoted very fast and besides maybe unwanted emotional. Yeah first it was I was Towing very carefully trying to figure out what my role would be and how quickly I could start to help and then it happened all of a sudden.  I mean, I think definitely one of those days that I realized you were definitely the ops manager as when we were like at lemur like reorganizing everything you like. God damn it John get out of here. We're doing this. Yeah. So basically I turned lemur into Retail Pharmacy that you would see at a grocery store. So basically took it and started a basket system that basically prioritize things based on priority mistakes.  Things that we needed to nip check or regular orders or based on shipping speed. So then just kind of continue to Quality improve that and that's kind of where we're at. That's what I thought. Everyone had happened. I was like John what's going on with Lamar? Like what's with all these baskets? Yeah. You were like, it's Abby and I was like, oh that makes sense. It looks like a pharmacy. Yeah, and I like everything every time I go into a pharmacy now, I'm looking at the baskets and I see them stacked up in the orders and I'm like, oh my God that basically was like later Farm.  Yeah, yeah. Yeah basically looks like that you want to know what our inventory room looks like this going to a pharmacy. Yeah. It's basically like just replace drugs with ink. Yeah. Yep, just a little bit more breakable a little less dangerous. But one of the same or just as dangerous dangerous, I mean we do say fountain pens are drugs. It basically is so your first fountain pen was that but what was your first actual fountain pen? The first fountain pen that I ever purchased was a black e-coat  It was for Eco. I want to stop. Yeah and a stub nerve it had black stone Barrier Reef blue in it. And I loved it. It was great. It was like my first real pain that I bought for myself and I used it for I mean every single use I would say definitely wasn't anything too special can we could mention why it's in the past tense. Sorry. Yeah, I realize that as I was saying it. So unfortunately, I am out of pain deficit right this minute as my  Fountain pens are missing they were lost or misplaced a tap-in meat and we are still waiting for them to reappear. I have a little bit of hope that there are some we're still and they're going to reappear but losing a little bit of Faith by the day. I do still have one. I have an esterbrook that I bought at the San Francisco pain show. So I have that still floating around but everything else is still missing.  It's yeah, it's really bad. And I you know, fortunately we can replenish your supply pretty quickly but it's you know, there's some sentimental value to some of those so right and that's I think also what kind of reaffirmed that I really love being in depends that I miss them and I think about my little kvitko art sport that has the new Grind on it that I didn't even really get to enjoy and I'm just like one day I'm going to find them or maybe they're going to reappear. So I hope so. We're still holding out, but it probably going to die buried somewhere.  Maybe you know, maybe fingers crossed on that. Yeah, and I miss my Galen leather case. Oh, yeah, because you had a ton pen case. I have five turned into a 10-ton. Yeah to use it like a 10-man case. It is definitely only designed for five pins. I think those are really neat. I think I need to get a tenpin Kate a 40-pound. I have 240 pins already have to I need probably a third wasn't bookshelf full of pain. So I have I have  of a new desk that I bought you guys haven't seen it yet, but it's a mid-century modern Danish teak desk from the 50s that was actually brought here from Vermont in the back of a truck and it's one of those desk that's kind of a floating top and on the front side of it is actually a bookshelf. Oh, I've seen those I love those that secret storage flux had one of those just just recently that we looked at two that I'll be great for pen and ink storage. It's really beautiful. It's  The one I really really wanted was actually kind of a almost not a you but it is slightly curved but they're like $3,000 this one with a cop knows that home acaba straight straight. Okay. This one is Got a Brand I will find it. But if you can't tell the three of us are actually really into mid-century furniture. Yes, that's one of my Main Hobbies we seem to not be able to find affordable.  Ha no, no also mid-century furniture takes up way more room than pins do a lot more. Yeah. It is more intense Maurice villain. See I have heard of that. I don't know if I've ever seen one in person. Yeah, you have to come see it. Yep. I will definitely look that's great. I will put a photo of my office in the show notes so that you can see the situation it is worth it. It's beautiful. Mmm. So, what's your Grail Abby pain right now? I think  Um, I'm looking for a rotten Galaxy vanishing point. I think I was a little bit late to the game on that. But I will one of these days I will break down and just buy it at a pen show if I see when I will let you know. Yeah, I'm still interested you want specifically the Galaxy one? Yeah. Hmm, welcome to the club at night. I know but I'm very particular about stuff. I'm a minimalist by Nature so I will hold out until I find it.  We'll find you one. Well, yeah, it's I don't doubt it. There's always one available H is at welcome at what cost? Yeah, exactly. I see him every once in a blue moon. I've actually almost bought them about three times. But I already have a rotten water stripe. I'm like do I need all the vanishing points with rotten? I mean, yes, the answer is always all the rod. I actually I have just a plain black vanishing point just a regular one and I've about three times almost sent it to welcome.  No to get it right in iced because I have problems you have a rotten problem. I have a bad route. They're all so beautiful. Uh-huh. I mean, I'm in my I'm having my pens in my lap and I think I only have one pen with rotten in it on it with me, which is shocking but is it the Platinum? It's my Platinum. It's my I'm gonna have it on we see this one day if I've seen that yet to be honest. Is that your mint twins be in there as well. It is my mint twins because such a cute color.  Oh, I love this pretty yeah, the sparkles on it are really fantastic to be honest. What might need that too. I know that I'd hook. Yeah, that's true. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. That's also the problem is it's hard like you said on one episode. It's hard to just get it in a box regularly with a bunch of other inventory and it feel special. You're like up that's mine goes out to the side and it's very just not eventful here like  Check the box that comes and there's no like celebration. Look here's your pen. It's just it's in there somewhere under the bubble wrap like a box of all the others. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. You know, what you should do is you should if you know you are getting something for the other one in the Box the one who it's not for should unpack it and then like find it and put a little bow on it and give it a solution. We should we wrap it. Yeah, you can just email Bryce. He'll probably he's probably even listening to this eyebrows. Hi, you can just order from him. Oh that's true order from him and have it shipped to you there.  We go. Oh, that's I like that or he'll like hand delivered to you at a pen show. I just want to walk a ceremony or something. I just don't have to take inventory on my own pain. No, that's not that's checking yourself out. It's not fun. Yeah checking yourself out is also not fun. Yeah cool. It's a little out of it. What does kind of want to give myself? I mean, it doesn't really matter. Oh gosh. So do you incorporate fountain pens at work? I have so I had just started using  My decimal at work and I had been super nerd and brought in my own paper. I'm not a sprinting my patient lists on my fancy paper and using my fancy pen pen on rounds and then I think like just that it was that week. That depends. All right P. So what paper were you printing your lists on? What did you give me John HP 24, whatever cat recommended that I bought. Yeah, really? Can I have like a stack this High stole? Yeah because it's fantastic.  And it's super thick. I think the next time I'm by HP, it's going to be the you must have bought the 32 about 32. So the 24 yes is longing to buy next which is not like as thick you can use it to like as a fan. Oh, yeah. It's yeah. I thought it formed a really nice crease in it. Like look nice in my lab coat and when I sat down I didn't get caught on the chairs because it was basically a card. Yeah in my in my pocket. It's the best. It's what I used to print all of my patient lists on until someone do that.  Told that I ruined the printer. I think you should try again. I don't think I really learned you. Yeah. Yeah, luckily the printers in our office and I'm the first one that gets there so you can just print I can just there's no rules there and there's no rules. I got the kikuyo to do that with but it's a for and my printer hates me for that. So can I can I pause real quick and just mention that ask Miss? Dr. Axe. And do you have a messenger tube at your hospital? I think you miss named me.  John I'm sorry. Dr. Paul Masson. Oh, yes. We have a tube system. Dr. LG's you have a tube system. Yeah, we have a tube. So Abby mentioned this to me casually like she sent it something via tube and I'm like, what is that and she goes, uh pneumatic tube and I'm Googling it and I'm like what they do at the bank to send you your thing. Right? I'm freaking out because she told me that this hospital has the longest tube Network. Yeah and like the country and by length, it might be the world. I  I can't verify either of those things online. But I have heard that based on the fact that it runs throughout the city and it runs all three hospitals and I run outside underneath a monorail monorail track. Yeah at IU Eskenazi and Methodist it yeah Methodist University and Riley Hospital and Rise. You can to buy anything and it runs miles and miles and miles underground and I just casually mentioned this to John.  And I didn't see the excitement and unfortunately, I've always worked in a place that I use the tube and after the first few times and how unreliable it is. It's so unreliable. It kind of takes the fun out of it. John is still really really understood him. I'm just fascinated by turn-of-the-century kind of stuff or old school analog things. Are you gonna tube someone their meds from the pharmacy? That's many floors away. It's a matter of how you guys are so matter-of-fact. It runs under a freaking monorail. Look how cool is that we have  Set our house. Everybody has tubes. That's how you get stuff. I mean, you're not going to Abby's not going to leave the pharmacy and walk at one Zofran dose to the seventh floor psych Wing like she's going to to bit. Yeah. I just I think he has felt understand how awesome yeah, I guess but honestly though if you didn't know that existed probably never know. Yeah, I know prom like a logistical perspective. I don't know if anyone would ever notice it and you should always know you show me.  Our office and you're like there's the tube and then over here is this and instead of going like that's the pneumatic tube that has miles that runs underneath the freaking monorail outside and has snow on it, but that's so cool. We throw our paper in it as a paper storage for office supplies, and I don't even know what the context of oh, yeah, I'd said, I tube someone our house keys while they were watching her and the donut one. Yeah. Yeah some people to food through it just as jokes. Oh, yeah, that's how it came up and was so  I have a friend who works at another hospital across town that the tube connects to and I want to send like really stupid things it can do where does it connect to University and Riley Hospital? That's what he said. So this is like pen pals, but I want to start like a pen pal program through the tube. That's kind of funny actually like you could write like a handwritten letter on a fountain pen paper and stuff and then to bit that's actually kind of funny John and we could set up a camera and watch the To Go pass.  The say no, it's not it's really not as cool. As you think it is. I don't think it's that way. I guess it's such an acquaintance technology. But then when I try to think through my head how else we do something I can't think of any other way if someone listening right now is going that's really cool. You guys are just Jaden's. Yeah, you told it to one of our friends at a party at a work party and he was like what? Yeah monorail. Yeah and the same room same reaction I had but he doesn't work in medicine kind of felt like a brat for not having a  Excited reactions Yeah. Well, yeah and there's a tube it and they closed the monorail to I did it was yeah, so that's all so sad. Yeah you Abbi Works in a system. That's a lot more more Hospital more. It's just bigger. Well, I actually don't know that it's necessarily a larger hospital system total but like in close proximity in proc in English teacher campus is larger than my campus. Yes.  But I'm part of a 23 Hospital Network in Indiana just of the st. Vincent's and then Ascension is a hundred and sixty. Yes true. So but they're not all in the same place. Anyway, that was weird Sidetrack, but I'm not mad about it. No so tube. So we should get John a tube for Christmas next year. I know nice. The first question I had is how do we integrate this into lemur? You don't because it's not big enough.  Can you imagine sorry we're bankrupt. We had a ten million dollar tube system installed communicate between two people. Yeah, so we can send each other messages. Yeah, you should just get a carrier pigeon. Honestly. It's been mentioned for ordering sailor inks. Oh, that's right. Yeah or fax. No, I want to be able to be a sailor ink order to someone. Yeah. I don't think that that's practical at all. John neither is ordering if I telephone but here we are.  So we should we should have it installed your sailor inks online. Yeah, I saw that I may or may not have done it like two weeks ago whoo-hoo help regret how Progressive I bought like three more bottles of sale Erick Studio inks. I saw they were back in stock. Oops. I figured since I was about pens I should not order ink we gotta get you hooked up. I thought about it. I should just let you take some of these with I have slightly some out. Yeah. I have 8 pens or something in my bag right now. So what did you guys get for Christmas?  I got some books and a lump of coal and I met pain-wise John I didn't get no your about myself the music. No. Yeah, why men that came in? That's all we talked about the last episode. That's really it. Would you get Katherine? I saw something arrived.  Did I get some paper? Oh my order from dram wolves came. I bought myself three bottles of say luring Studio inks and one of the new man yo sailor inks and the Yamamoto paper sampler. We try those yet. Yeah, I wrote on all of them and it's super fun. Do you have like a specific favorite? There were I don't have the list in front of me, but I have a few that are my favorites and one of them is rumored to be the upcoming musubi labs and print new notebook.  I need to see can you bring that next time we hang? Yeah, I'm gonna see you guys tomorrow night, right? Oh, yeah.  That's happening, right? Yeah, dear. Yeah, so I'll see you tomorrow. Yeah for you tomorrow. Bring it bring it. Well, we we can play with them my God, we're so lame. I mean we're staying in our comfy clothes and we're going to play with big. Yeah. What songs are great time. I also you don't know this yet, but I will spill the beans I also for myself for Christmas. I will not have these until the end of January beginning of February, but I my friend in Tokyo  Helped me acquire the bung box sailor the third real. Oh, there's a dark navy blue with some subtle Sparkles and a rotten snowflake on the cap. Oh, wow, and also a pain from a tiny little shop in Tokyo that you can't really get to and that is an amethyst color with a slight Sparkle and translucency and what looks to be either gold or rose gold trim and some matching ink for that.  How did you find these? Oh Instagram and then I reached out to my friend and Tokyo and said will you please help me and he said absolutely and it's like the dark web for fans gonna say, yeah, that's the only way I can imagine. He's got him at his at his place and they will eventually make their way to me. But this is Tokyo Station pens and he's actually doing he didn't knocking out a togi grind on the bung box one. Okay, and he's gonna put an architect down.  Other one, absolutely. This is like the hard drugs of thumb pad with this is serious shit. This is it. Yeah, that is incredible. I just bumped my mic with my glasses because my glasses are fake. Hold on. Let me show you this picture will those be at the next pin me if they're here, but they have to come from Japan so they may be the p and meet pain meet after that.   That's really cool. Hold on look.  This is my actual one. That's great. That's a good Christmas present to Merry Christmas to me because like I hear you like you unusual grinds. Are you interested in anything? And I was like sure he's like, how about architect? I was like, yeah and then he goes wait. Do you want to knock it out at oh because like I told ya I send it. Yep. If you say no we have bigger problems, so that that's my Christmas present to myself. Excellent. So my whole not buying any more pens  20/20 or 2019 failed, huh? They won't be here till 2020 though. So yeah. Alright, it's fine. Whatever. You have to tell yourself. Yeah, fine. Did you get anything out of me? Not pain-wise not yet. I've been just Meandering hoping that my pens will show up before I buy anything. But like I said, I will probably end up buying buying something soon, especially since the pain show circuit is about to restart. I'm sure I will feel very very motivated.  Second I step foot into Pinchot. I think a king of pain. It's an order. I don't go straight for the straight for the throat. That's a big pain for Abby. Yeah. She was just a 1911 large. I mean that was that is true. That is true. But I liked my decimal. I think I think it does. Yeah. I just you more with the smaller pens. Yep. Yeah more your Vibes more My Vibes. Hmm. So what's on your wish list for 2020?  Besides obviously, you said your Grail. Do you have anything else you're looking at? I need to expand my ink game. My in game is so boring compared to everyone else. Yeah, blue black black Navy and dark purple is a little bit boring. So I need to expand my ink knowledge as well as my color choices and what I decide to use them for I'm just too practical with them and I for some reason I can't just read we say this every time there's people  Just use one brand of blue black and that's it. And that's all they use for every pain. So the fact that you have any variation at all of Blues and blues and blacks like is all right. Yes step forward. Yeah. It's totally fine. I always feel validated at Penn chose because I find people that are very particular here looking for one thing and one thing only and then I feel peer pressured by John over there for more colors and more things and don't be so boring. And yeah, I mean, it's your the counterbalance to my like lime green and orange. This is aesthetic. So this is true.  I think I may be cracked the triple digits in terms of ink bottles at my house. So feel free to come over and play I will okay. Well, I like that what's on your 22s watchlist us watched a some time. I've already Swatch Tom. I know I need to bring like a coloring over and I'll steal your ink.  But you can't see his my eyeball twitching it. Why are you going to Swatch all my eggs John when you're not using it I do I go through many. I ran out of ink at work into pens. What's what's like the bottle you've gone through the most like what brand of Ink. Have you gone through the most?  I don't know like mine was here. She's uku just answer just me personally not sampling an alcoholic actually going through it. I rotate so much and I use so many different inks. I think I'm like pretty I'm moving through my Aukerman number 14 the pop Park pop. / / yeah 14 not it. I'm moving through that one. Mostly because I love it and it's not limited like my beetles. Yeah, because I went through  Probably half a bottle of beetles before I realized I should maybe Chill on that. I'm gonna buy a bottle of this in 2020. I think I'm also aware before it's gone. I'm like totally plowing through my bottle of inktober with by vaness the blacking to the point that I may have to start beating down her door and asking for more that's open you yeah Mom. Yeah when she said that I was like, oh, I forgot about that Mont Blanc Beatles is too.  If Lee also my list, which is so ago that pain. Yeah. Yeah girl. Come join me in the club are beautiful because I'm surprised I was surprised when you said that because I showed it to you and you and you were like I want that. Yeah and almost because that's not your aesthetic. I thought no, I mean it has that retro aesthetic. Let's put she's mid-century. Yeah and like straight mid-century. I love it. It's yeah, I think that's super on brand for Abby. Yeah it is and it's big but like not too big. Yeah, every time I write with you is I'm like, yep need that. I forgot about that.  Yeah, yeah, that's also on that on that short list. I think what's going to happen is I was going to take the cash from our pain show at the end of the day and just grab the grab the cash bag and just walk over to someone be like I bought something. What do we tell the money go and I owe you some money. It's fine. You know when you're an adult you can make those decisions and how exactly it's nice. It's an executive decision and she is an executive and lemur. Yeah exactly.  What's on your list John? I think I need to crack the the oversized pain the m-1000 king of pain that that sighs. I need something in that in that range broad nib and go just go for it retro look something saying that for awhile. You definitely need I definitely need it. Yeah, and I think I just need to do it. Yeah, I was thinking and I'm 1012 talking with Chris the last Pinchot he goes nothing 1000. I don't like that.  I can't now get the m808v don't want someone to be like, oh you can get them 1,000. It's such a it's just a thing now where I'm like I have to get the new version of the built it up. Then it just seems like a disappointment even if you really love it. Yeah, you weren't like notable online. I was talking about wanting big pens and talking about on a podcast. You could probably just buy the M 800 but you've done this to yourself. Oh, I know. I have to follow I painted myself into a corner here. You have no choice.  What about you? Oh, okay. There you go sailor depends. I don't even know I want yet that yes, we should just need a go fund me and go to Japan. Yep, or just I can probably just do a couple extra shifts and go to Japan. That's true and I can find us a cheap flight. I'm on De I'm definitely on it. Yes, I'll just look at some week. I'm off and work the week that I'm off as extra help at work and then I'll have the money to go to Tokyo. There you go. I do.  I need to send my pens to bulk Mondo. I think I'm going to send her two or three.  Because why not? Do you have any back here from her? Huh? You have any back yet? I haven't sent any Oh, I thought I was going to but I never did it cuz I'm a bum so I'm going to say I think I'm gonna send my pilot 823. Oh, that's right. Oh, yeah because I don't like that pennis that ugly. I know it's phalluses. You don't like the gold right? I don't like the gold and I just don't like much about it other than the nib which is fantastic. I don't like the filling system, but I like writing with it. Like I really enjoy riding with it. So I think if I appreciate it,  Been covered in rotten then I'll love it because then it's not to love right. She'll aesthetically be my thing and then I want to write with her because that nib is amazing. So I'm going to do that. I think I'm gonna do my vanishing point.  And then maybe my sailor progear of the black one. Hmm really guys at the one that Bach is fixed it is I love it is Sailor overboard our first show. It's so good. Now you should have break all your nips and send him to expensive habit. I think I could probably get them all to write like that without breaking them first. I could just give them all the mark and he would make them perfect. Yeah, but that's not that's not as fun story. Yeah. Yeah.  So tell us what it was like to go to your first pain show as a new depends person. I was not sure what the pain show entailed. I had only heard about what John had done at Penn shows and kind of what happens, you know after the pain show, but I really couldn't put that together in my mind. I hadn't really ever been to a trade show. The only thing I've ever done is like a residency conference, but I had never sold anything so our first pain  experience was  it was definitely a new and enlightening experience to who the pain Community is because besides the people that I had met at pain meets or just you know, the people that we had met here in our kind of intimate Community. I didn't really know what the Outreach look like until we got there and then I saw it was everyone and I learned it which was your first show Abby.  Was my first show st. Louis, Ohio. No. Yeah. My first show was Ohio 2018. Yeah was my first show and I felt extra special about it because I'm from Ohio. I knew the area that we were going to so I kind of felt like at home, but also a fish out of water at the same time. So that was kind of a weird juxtaposition between everything. But yeah, that was that was a really good show for Lemur in general and it was basically just  Almost like being a pharmacist finding what go by fire what the person needed and checking them out and moving along. You did great though. It was really smooth. Did you buy any mid-century furniture on your drive to or from Ohio? Not that one? No other ones we have other ones. I've also looked and considered how big of a trailer we would need to bring home the things but st. St. Louis one of these years. I'm not saying that I'm not flying there and then driving a U-Haul home so sorry.  Yeah, okay. Okay. I'll be driving by myself. Yeah, so do you pretty much Drive doll the pentose right? We do for the most part the bigger ones that are within probably 8 or 12 hours. We've been driving to the one we definitely fly to a San Francisco. Yeah, but we're probably going to end up driving two more shows in the next couple of years. I would imagine just  Is flying with everything is Terry exceedingly difficult and makes things exceedingly more difficult when you get home and everything's in suitcases. Yeah suitcases are not fun. So I think we'll be driving even like Atlanta will bring in a caravan that one I want to follow behind you in my car. Okay, cool. That one's gonna be a no-brainer because it's like 9 hours but Tech San Francisco. I don't see was ever driving to and less.  Some freak reason because it's going to be cheaper to ship the stuff there. Yeah, exactly. So  Do you have any funny pain show stories?  We've had a couple interesting customer interactions of just things that people say or what they asked us to do, but I don't think anything to to particular funny would probably be between us and other vendors or like you and me or people like Pinchot regulars. It's not it's not going to be like a thing that happens during the show. It's like a after hours or on the way there. I'm trying to well think of it as soon as we get off the off the yeah.    when there's something the donut falling on my foot  I don't know if that's podcast worthy me.  Now, I don't really have any funny stories.  I guess we had talked about you meeting people at Ohio in St. Louis and like meeting like Nick and all those guys in like after hours of the bar. Like what that was like your first time. Oh, yeah, so that was probably one of the most interesting things I think to also putting everyone's face with their name. So I started following people online not really ever, you know, heard their voice just know what they, you know carry in their pen case. So that was a really fun experience to meet  All see Nick paying in person and see his work was really incredible meeting Jacqueline and yeah come and get the quick realization. She was also a pharmacist lived in in the kind of realizing that there's a lot of people that are pharmacists or in Pharmacy that are in depends which totally makes sense to me now. So I think that was probably something that was most surprising to me and then every pain show it's just finding more people that are like ourselves.  Elves hmm. It's neat. I was laughing to my mom in the car on the way here. I was talking to her. I was like there's a shocking number of like Farm deeds and phds and MDS in our community. There's a lot of us. Yeah, and then even just talking Angela tears. Yeah what we do and they're like, oh, yeah. I am like I've had a pain or I'm in depends John has helped a couple of my co-workers and their husbands who were once in depends kind of get back.  Into it we are so yeah lawyers, we gave one of our good friends their first pen for Christmas vanishing point. Yeah. Yeah, that's them out and I filmed a how to Ink it at Christmas. That's far as I was in my parents kitchen. Yeah, how they can get their pain to work. That's so fun. Yeah. It's really fun. And I think to especially being like where I am in my career and after residency and board certification all this stuff. It's like the pain show world is a  whole nother realm to kind of tackle and figure out and logistical things that I can spend my brain power working on definitely been helpful with that. Yeah speaking of helpful. How is a be helped lemur ink grow and the past since you've been dating, huh? I mean, it's immeasurable. I think this setting up things with like setting up the the inventory as a pharmacy and just Organization for orders and in and out and  Double checking things again. We basically treat everything like it said drug order so checking over orders and not kind of glancing at it. But actually physically checking everything Crossing it off on our packing slips, like little things like that and operations is helped immeasurably. But yeah, I'd say just tightening focus and keeping an eye on objectives. I'm like where we want to be in the future. She's really helped with that and I don't  I think Weaver was ever supposed to be a one one man show especially from just how much work and how much double checking and inventory management. It's just definitely a two-person job for years from an efficiency perspective, especially even up in shows. I mean, he's more of the face of the brand, you know, he's the one that most people know. So for me, I'm over there talking to other vendors like, all right. So tell me about your inventory management system. Do you have two setups? Do you have one set up tell me about how you ship things like just trying  Figure out more of the logistical things. That way he can go about and meet other people and talk to vendors about products so that way we can kind of divide and conquer exactly that's neat.  Plus she helps balance your ADHD. Yeah. Yeah, he's definitely the more social butterfly of the two and I would rather sit there and work on the spreadsheet or figure out number. So but you also pulled me out of my shell and Pinchos especially helpful because you realize that not everybody is as outgoing as they seem. Yeah. Also most people in the pen Community, I would say it's probably fair to say most are not extroverts know I would also agree with that. I think it's just a bunch of people that have found the same.  Same hobby. That's also the other thing I would say that's most surprising to me about pain shows is that most people don't know like I always ask John. Oh, do they have children? Like what do they do? Where do they live? He's like, I don't know. I just know what they carry what they do like in terms of pens and in the community, so I think it's just it's a nice outlet for people to take a break from their normal life and they find this community of people that is is focused around pens. So,  It's like was probably the most surprising thing that I yeah, almost had a hard time with because I feel like an outsider. Yeah, I was like, what do they have children or they can ask what I do. I'm like no, they're never going to ask what you do. They might eventually but it's more of a what pens do you like and it's just all focused on pens. We don't talk politics. We don't talk religion. We don't take talks all of those things. Well, yeah at a certain level if you're friends with someone you might but just on a cursory yet. It's so fine to be an introvert pain shows like you can literally just sit at the bar and like  Play with people's pens and not really talk to them if you don't want to. Yeah, and that was like the most scary thing for me is I didn't want to go to the bar because I didn't know what I was going to say. I don't really have you asked me that so many times. What am I going to say? What do I bring? What do I wear them? Like come as you are say nothing just be you. Yeah, and it's literally the truth. Yeah, it's neat which is so cool. Yeah. It's such a great Community. There's always enough extroverts to help make it work. Oh, yeah for sure. I'm like I can bring like the wine and the cheese all those  Things but someone else was going. Yeah, we did that at the st. Louis show. What do you think? We they ran out of tables? So we organized like a bunch of tables and grab some cheese that we had left over from the show. Yeah, since I'm driving to Atlanta. I actually I think I was talking to some people and I'm going to bring Indiana Indiana specific beer to Atlanta to be unequal. You'll be like, I have all this beer that I brought from Indianapolis. I forget it's like in demand outside of here. Yeah, three Floyd's you can't get outside of it.  Deanna so I'm just going to start buying Three Floyds and then just fill my trunk with three we're going to sell out from underneath the table. Just got a liquor license. Yeah, no looking for a pan. Okay, so we're going to Rapid Fire through some Q&A questions. Now, let's do it. Okay from Andrew, I'm assuming this is Andrew Coon.  What are your unsung surprising Heroes which brands models links that you avoided overlooked blew your minds when you finally got to check them out in person.  Good question. Yeah.  I did not expect the Aukerman bottles to be as beautiful as everyone said that is true. Yeah, they're really incredible. I'm one that's very picky about packaging and logistical things in terms of how they're structured and the balance in between them and its really good there. Yeah. Yeah, and I even told you I'm like, these are really cool bottles. Yeah and opening it. You're like, whoa, that's so cool. Yeah and my musubi Journal that I bought.  I'm Darrell at San Francisco. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I don't have the I don't know. I'm too scared still to write in it. I think about it once a day but I don't write anything in it too scared 2020. Yeah, right in your Mississippi. Yeah, he could always get another one. I know just so pretty and perfect. I just love it. I'll supposed to make on your first page and let you get going. Yeah, I know I need someone else to start writing in them John raises his hand briskly.  And I think my biggest UNG unsung hero was probably Franklin Christoph and they're not an unsung hero for people but I had like no idea and I didn't appreciate like what they were what they had because I'd seen them at Chicago like many years but it wasn't until Atlanta of 2019 where I look went over and looked in was like, holy shit. These are like beautiful pieces of art. They're so like consistent, you know, I love that they're you know, because they're CNC they're  Like very very consistent in the tolerances is very low. I mean like everything is just perfect. They were I was not impressed by them until I saw them this year and then I was like, ah, yes. It's I get it now. I know I have like five or six I start to get my first one. I don't have any they're so good. I have like six now we make my way over there sometime. Yeah, it's getting away from the table and going over to that table, which is how is busy.  It's their net there never dead over there where I can just be like hey, what's up? Like? Yeah, I usually can only wonder the people that are around us the side of the drum goals and turn back around. Yeah. Yeah, they're really that's mine. Why is lemur ink named lemur from flanker 358 or as first name is John. I disliked lemurs. It's a simple as that. I always liked lemurs. I wanted to name something whatever company I started lemur blank. So  It's called lemur or it's lemur whatever lemur pens didn't sound as good and it got called lemur ink it just kind of fell into place and it was just so obvious to me that I call the business lemur. So I've always liked ring-tailed lemurs. That's fun.  What is a favorite stationary purchase of 2019 and one you regretted from chaotic? Who mine was my Musubi was your favorite was my favorite definitely do not regret that what do I regret? I bought something.  Someone gave me that notebook. That didn't work very well. It was cool from the from a pelican Hub. I think it's called a Quattro. Yes. It's a cool-looking notebook and thank you for sending it to me. I like the aesthetic of it, but the paper isn't the best is it better with pencil don't know it probably would be better with pencil. Sometimes those papers like sometimes certain notebooks are not great with out and pens and so they just get migrated into being like my pencil notebook. It's fine with a ballpoint. Yeah, I brought it to work and I use it with  Ballpoint. Oh nice, but the structure of IT schools. Yeah, the structure of is really great. And I think the that I don't regret the purchase, but I regret not using it more was my rhodium eating book because it has so much hell yeah meetings, but I forget it the second I walk out of my office every time I go to a meeting. What was your favorite of 2019 John?  Hmm. I don't know. I don't have one. Hmm because I have so many notebooks. I say we blow through so many notebooks how you want paper. Do we know poke? It could be a pain. Oh Station videos like an overarching. Oh, yeah. I think I forgot what I got my 23, but I would say that's all kind of group that in there here 823. Yeah, and there's also as The Unsung not the unsung hero, but the yeah these surprising unsung hero and I think it's kind of a  That same breath. I think both of us were surprised how good the Momiji ink was. Oh that was it. That was her sure and changer kept asking us about it at Penn shows. We'd never tended to bring the right amount and chose and then we finally some dude it out and put it in her own pens and they're like, okay, so then messing up my dude was like it has gold chain and in it. Oh, yeah, and I never really notice it because I'm not a big red ink guy and definitely no have it Inked Up and my vanishing point.  I love it. Yeah, so sorry if I write all of your notes in that ink, it's that that in yellow boot. Oh, yeah, and I'm really good at math and science but not a good speller. So mummy-ji is much easier for me to spell than some other words. Yeah your sake Sheikh Abu is it sir? Why I never pick that one. That's a mighty 23 right now and I hate writing notes because but I love using it but it's like I have to write up the whole name of the ink every single time. Yeah, so  My favorite was my Galaxy. I think that goes yeah, that's it. Clearly mama know what you that's my galaxies. My nakiya Milky Way galaxy and my Platinum Galaxy both. Hmm. Oh a really big pain year for you. It was a big it was right hmm pigpen year for you. So there was on one of the forms that were all on I actually don't think Abby's on but  There was somebody who said how much how many dollars they spent on pens in 2019 and the number was a pretty big number and everybody was like, oh my God and my reaction to it was to put out there. I mean that's that's a that's a dangerous game will not count up and I will not acknowledge. No, but there's not one thing that you bought this year that I didn't see in thought and I wouldn't buy it like that. I wouldn't purchase that or or understand. Why you love  It so much. It was just such good purchases. Thanks. I don't really have any regrets a couple of the pens. I a body ended up, you know sending to new homes because I didn't they weren't like hugely big loves for me. But that's just being a responsible pet owner or really anything. I mean, yeah, I don't I don't really regret.  anything  no regrets is fine. No regrets shirts. I don't I don't really have any.  Where I bought something wouldn't like. Whoo. Yeah, except maybe something we've bought too much of but yeah, that's a that's a whole that's more of a business which is school. Yeah. I kind of regret not getting the star. Ruby Pelican Lloyd. Yeah, we have those. Yeah. Well, I'm an extra fun. I'm going. Oh good. That's my favorite. I'm going over to the Lemur headquarters tomorrow. So llegue Luke encourage elegant come shopping. Just give me a bag and I'll distract her.  Should not be allowed near inventory. Only Mertz that also can't believe it's New Years Eve. It's crazy. Now when you're listening, it'll be 20/20, but we're still a day off. Yeah, well we're recording this.  No, really law JK adri asked you Abby. What's your EDC and Grail pain? We I think pretty much covered those. Yeah Mont Blanc Beatles since I didn't really say that aloud now, that's definitely it and what well, what's your for the other medical people out there? What's your daily care? You just bought some we got something for Christmas the pilot the pilot V5. I carry those at work. I tend to leave them places not by choice. Usually I just  Pulled away in an emergency and my pain sits there and someone nab's it from me. So that's usually what I write with it's fine enough that I can write a lot of patient information on a list and it doesn't blur all together and have a kind of a 3-pin system with colors as to what I write down as facts what I need to follow up on and what I need to do tomorrow, so that's kind of my my personal system at work, but do use the same three colors every day or is it always okay. I use the same three colors for kind of completed.  And then like what I need to do and then what I need to follow up on our reach out to have somebody help me with because I use a 3 color system, but it's different three colors every day because I take all my pens and I look and I'm like, oh these colors go together. And so then I do all my pre charting with one color and then my rounding color and then my like later in the day color. Yeah, like yeah. I kind of have a similar system just mind tended to same Thrillers. Yeah. Yeah. I also try to yeah instill that kind of skill with my  To so I think the same colors helps. Yeah helps them. I was talking to one of my residents yesterday and give you her feedback after the week and she uses the multi pen. Well, there's because of that exact same reason is she didn't want to have three pens. So she uses the multi pens so that she can we I mean we all are like you think all of us in medicine used like a multicolored system. The multi pen is really popular even in my office between my office mates at just the tip of it. It's not fine enough for me.  Me. Yeah, I think they're a Bunkie better multi pens and Brad Dowdy always talks about a couple so I'll look into them and maybe send you one. Yeah, let's do it. There we go. Malti pins Frank Wilson. I think we kind of already talked about this. He asked what does how does an introvert make friends at a pen show? I would say  One of the things that kind of helped me break out of my shell at a pen show is if somebody's talking about something and kind of their their knowledge has ended and they're questioning something or trying to figure out if they want that kind of just imparting the knowledge that you have about that product or hey, I have that or do you want to try mine out or let me show you how mine is this might help you with that purchase, or do I want to sell this or what? Am I looking for might help them out. The after dark can be intimidating.  It certainly was for me at first because I mean John's a very social creature. So he would go talk to a bunch of other people and I would just kind of be what I felt to be kind of stuck there without anything to say but I just started writing with other people's stuff. Even the simple question of like when you're testing out a pen. What do you write on the paper? Do you write your name? Do you write your address just simple conversation that will turn into a meaningful interaction with somebody so that's how I kind of started having more meaningful.  Extraverted interactions with people that's pretty good advice. It's it's definitely difficult, but I don't think it's impossible. No, it's definitely not impossible. I think I was just kind of uncomfortable with being uncomfortable just because my daily life is kind of what I expected from the minute I wake up for the most part. So going into a pen show where I felt kind of like a fish out of water was definitely interesting, but at the end of the day, it's all about the Hobby and sharing what you have what you know,  Looking for what you want. So those are all pretty basic needs that most people have  Cool. Beth asks us some questions. What is your favorite pen and ink combo right now, Abby you can't I'm sorry. No, I do have the mere sake Sheikh Abu in my esterbrook and it's pretty good. That's a good ink. It's really good. Which esterbrook do you have? I have the tortoiseshell. Oh, that's very you it's okay. Yeah. It's very own brand everyone. I think that was during the release of the Honeycombs. Everyone wanted that and I was like, I just really want  Tortoiseshell one. So yeah, I need to buy you a bottle of Mont Blanc coffee brown just to have yes, I have I had that in my little kvitko. That was the first think I put in it. It was really good. Yeah, I think you need a bottle of that was good. That's kind of your color. Yeah. What about you John favorite pen and ink combo hmm. I think it varies right now Aukerman number 5. Yeah, you've been living that is really good the oh, yeah, that makes sense for you. That's very you it's very I love  a good Cheney blue broad nib. Perfect. I saw you. I saw a list that you're at the other day and I was like, oh my God, that's so John look like you wrote it in a marker, but it was great. Yep. Sounds good. It's like a mire list. Yeah. Yeah something Horrible's like wrap Christmas gifts. Yep pack for Ohio river that list. Yeah. Yeah. I think my favorite one that I've been using a lot at work right now is the most dealer progear that I have from point spends. That's the lavender body with the sort of like pastel blue cap and  Has the ink that came with the pen in it. It's like a sort of bright blue similar to Waterman Serenity blue ink in it, and it was like a combo set and that's probably my favorite which is weird because I never write with blue ink that's gonna say that's so the ink is not you but that pain is very you I like very much in it. So it's practical. Yeah it is. It's a very practical thing but my other one is my other favorite right now is my montegrappa montegrappa lilac with the Sailor nudibranch purple ink in it. That's more on-brand for ya.  It's a great pain. It's so good. I think Beth had some more questions, right? Oh wish list for 2020. I think we kind of talked about that. Do you any other things you're going on the lookout for anyone?  No, I said what I had to say favorite pen show of 2019.  Atlanta who  it's so hard to answer that Atlanta. I had a lot of fun at Atlanta. It's such a good show. I loved all of the shows I went to but Atlanta yeah, I think my favorite was st. Louis. I unfortunately didn't go to Atlanta. You're going this year, right? I am. Yeah. Hey Lewis was really fun for us to I love your boots. Thank you. We are having some inclement weather today in Indiana. So wonderful stupid boot whether its food whether here I'm wearing pink Roth he's so I don't know Donna and waterproof.  Yeah, I dress for fashion over function always. So anyway, yeah, st. Louis was probably say Louis was really fun. I think from a business perspective. We were really successful at that show. We met a lot of great people out that show only merline released. Yeah. That was our general. I'm really so we had a good good Outreach for that that whole bunch of that helada buzz around it. Yeah. I think that that made it extra and you were like kind of in your Zone after a  Hi. Oh, yeah, I think yeah your second show. That was my second or third show. So I kind of knew what to expect knew. I was less stressed about the logistical stuff because we kind of had a good good plan going in and then at night we got to go to Mama's On The Hill in st. Louis going back to get out there discovered the kind of the Little Italy. I think that's what it's I think it has a better name the hill the hills what it's the hell. Yeah, we discovered the hill and rukun actually give us that recommendation. Yeah, we discovered that.  A whim just talking to him and we still talk about it at least once a week in our house. I forgot lemur lime was this year like that? Yeah. This was a big year. It was a big year lemur lime. I mean we had worked on that with black stone for what seemed like a long time and then yeah. Yeah the headaches of trying to get ink from Australia to here and one piece and go legit right packaging and all worked out, but I still like that for folded nip one of my favorite folded.  Nipping kz-- yeah, because it does this funny thing when it dries when you write with a lot of it where it's like darker around the edge and it's lighter in the middle and it just looks really different. I like that. That's one of my favorite folded it. You know, I have a bunch of bottles specifically full moon. I have like the one that I feel my pain with and the one that I don't care if it gets a little bit messy and that's what I fully admit. Well, you know because I made a mess at your house at that time. Yes. Okay. Let's see.  This is another one from Beth. What is something you know now that you wish you knew when you started this Hobby?  It's a really good question. Yeah.  I wish I knew that I was going to like all the nibs in the beginning. Hmm because I think I spent at least a year and a half just buying extra fine and fine pen where extra fine when we first met you were like, I was all you were all and extra fine. And now you have zoom which is like the extra fine music nibs broads. One of my I mean, my one of my all-time favorite pens is my Platinum Galaxy, it's abroad. Oh, yeah, so I kind of wish I had  New known then that I would be okay to Branch out and to consider those that I would I just I wish I had known that like you can try a bunch of pens and like you don't have to buy all extra fine. I don't know anything out is Iris. I actually have an extra fine pen now like I've sailor one that I don't even really like it. Like I just wish I had known at the beginning that you could really experiment and use different pens for different reasons and that  At your daily driver may still be a fine, but you can use all the other things for everything. We have. I always feel bad mentioning this to people when they when I asked him what they write with normally to pension. They say extra fighter fight and I'm like, it's just a matter of time. Yeah for you come to the dark side and you have a broader a stub. Well, I think that you know, some people have a preference and that's their predominant pain and then you have some other ones for other purposes. But like for me, I literally just have every single kind of nip because I like them in different moods. Yeah like yeah today.  This is a medium month for me. I like that I think too when you see other people's handwriting that also is a surprise at a pinch. Oh, yeah. See people's writing angles to see if they're Under and Over writer and then you see how big or small they write and then you see what they carry and all those things pretty much make sense. Yeah, totally or they're aliens like me and they have literally every kind of everything and write in crackling wait.  Under right and I side right both depending on the pain. Hmm. Yeah, it's just a chameleon and I have about six different handwriting's so I'm yeah I get that. I have many different handwriting's if you oh, this is from Jason wayfaring librarian. If you could have any ink designed after your personality, what would it be called? And what color would it be also has question John. So be brutally good question. Yeah, John's would be blue.  But I don't know what it would be called. It would be something offensive probably. Yeah, it would be it would be bright. I World War II joke, I was gonna say yeah, it would be like punny about war roughly. Yeah, it would be and I think the label would look like that book title that you're reading right now. Yeah. Yeah. I think it would be some type of like World War Two. Yep themed activities duty to any inside baseball history references. Yeah.  Yeah for you, I think it'd be like a you think it'd be a bright blue. I was thinking it'd be more of a darker blue. It's blue regardless blue. It would maybe have she not predictable. I think it would have seen though wouldn't it? Yeah, it would be sheeny. Yeah, you're really predictable John. That's okay. We still love you. Anyway. Yeah, I hate it. Have you feel like your taste varies a lot, but I feel like you're tried and true would be blue. Sorry, dear. Okay, it's okay.  Mine, I would think I'm thinking more about the bottle and how just it would be important shell. I think it would be yeah, the ink would be the color of tortoiseshell and it would have like shining characteristics that would give it a little bit of that hint of black. Yeah, it would be some black gray purpley combo for sure. I think it might be kind of brown in there though. Maybe. Yeah. I don't know I'm with the bottle would be tortoiseshell for sure for sure. And the packaging would be minimalists weren't even sure what it is kind of thing. Yeah. Yes.  mine would be  Basically the Sailor nudibranch Cinderella ink, it's like a little but it would be a little more Bluey I think than that one. It'd be like a base purple with like shading into pink and blue and maybe even a little grain and it would be pastel and everybody would be like you can't write with us on the next Irvine and I feel like I know you have to use Music nip and it would probably be beautiful. It would be very cool. I think it'd be like maybe even a little bit of hint.  Like I don't know like a minty bit like kind of that kind of green instead of green green and it and it would be in some like really wild round bottle. I have the bottle. It's a unicorn and the unicorn's horn is the is where you fill up.  I'm not wrong. I don't hate that or it maybe it's like a round bottle. It's like a round bottle in the the lid is like the horn and you unscrew it kind of from the side and there's like it's like sort of a round bottom boat with like a Mane and like eyeballs and it's glittery. So it's like they're in glass have a good do you could definitely do that. What's like the Chia Pet where it grows? Would you have like a Chia Pet bottle and then you could do the seeds and make your own main. That's the thing we meant. We didn't have any even mention that you're into plants. Yeah.  The plant lady I love the fact that it would come with seeds Debbie really cool a very hard thing to ship with seeds in it. You couldn't go in and a she could go International and someone can't cross state lines. But as a plant lady, I love the idea that I could also be a plant Potter happy. So cool. I would definitely propagate plants into it.  Okay. So Sandra WF cupcake girl.

I actually have a for our appointment coming up on Thursday. Well what you get in Tokyo gonna say you're gonna get one in Tokyo. Um, yeah. Yeah. I mean I'd have to guide have to find an artist ahead of time and get something you D like traditional but rotten get a run tattoo. I would want to get something with a really classic Japanese style because that's like where a lot of the classic tattoo.  - come from so I would I would probably need to do some research but it would probably be something with the classic like there's a sort of way that they do like a background for Japanese tattoos that involves late sort of these like bars and panels and it's sort of swirly looking and I probably have that in the background and then something in the foreground would be like, I don't know.  I just thought of a bowl of noodles, but that I'm not going to get a bowl of noodles. I don't know I might get like a super classic like dragon or something else. I was going to say what are you getting on Thursday? I'm working on my sleeve. So I have I've got four hours into this leave. I've got another four hours this week IM trying to do four hours every three or four weeks until it's done. It took about 30-something hours to do my right side sleeve. So we're getting there. We're starting on the left. Those just number two tattoos.  An art all right is a big thing for me anybody who ever comes over to my house? I'm just constantly a collecting. I'm trying to just have original art in my house. And if it's a print like a unique print like screen printer would cut or something or like hand embellished by the artist. I just got my first Feldman this week. It's not an original. It's a it's a screen print but it's beautiful screen print but like we've met the dude, so I signed it and it you know, so I got my first Feldman this week I  I just bought a giant piece from an artist named H Ward miles here in Indianapolis. She's kind of a big deal. I have two giant canvases once three feet by three feet and the one I just bought is two by four feet and it's over my bed. Oh cool. So art is a big thing. I have a couple pieces that the last time Matthew was here. I forced him to draw and I painted and then he lined so I have some pieces like stuff that I've done the but like with other people.  Yeah art collector. Yeah. Those are cool pieces. Yeah, you guys haven't seen how my house looks no. No. No, we haven't you want a drink quick fire through Andrew Coons Litany of questions here. Yep. All right. Do you hope Abby do you do our or encourage John's purchases a foam pits? I encourage because for us we're always looking for new products and brands that we're going to carry. So anything else that we can try and figure out if we like it why we like it. Would this be good for our  Murmurs and for lemur, so yeah, encourage strongly encouraged what has surprised. Oh, we already kind of did this surprised about pain shows and assumptions that were made. We Tasha gusts. Yeah the fishing vest that that could really come back ask me what to wear and I said it literally doesn't matter and you didn't believe me. No, I didn't it didn't it didn't matter and it certainly doesn't matter. So what's on your business card?  My business card or lemur. You don't have a lemur one. Yeah, I don't have a lemur. I have a lemur email, but I don't have a business card. Unfortunately, what's on your not other one pharmd my other one says my credentials and how you can reach me and where my office is which is pretty relevant because I'm never in my office. But yeah, it's not very exciting. I don't think it has the right information on it. To be honest. Do you have to deal with cold weather when shipping and receiving ink has ink ever Frozen?  I'll just answer because the answer is no we've never had anything freeze that I know no one's ever reported to me. No, I don't feel anything for he's our biggest struggle. Sometimes is when the Australian inks come from us just the error travel or boat and Customs sometimes we've had some issues just from like damage products and had to send some stuff back. But other than that, yeah, it's usually glass getting damn. Yeah over and over something freezing.  Although I just ship something to Canada and the guy asked for me to insulate it better. I'm like, it's the amount of bubble wrap will use its pretty well insulated. So I remember a couple of years ago though when we were below zero for multiple weeks at a time like well, I was buying ink from a different company because it was either before you existed or before I knew you existed and they actually halted shipping ink for like until it stopped being like negative 20. Yeah, because it was so bad in the back of the pack the face it's hard because like  Like I mean, it's negative 20 across. Do you remember that your is negative 20 across the whole Midwest for like 3 weeks. It was yeah, it was a January when it's something Regional like that, but it's so hard to go like, okay, where am I shipping is to what's the weather like right now? Yeah, it was like a whole like no whole Midwest was shut down that year and there's that the bubble wrap. We can buy the like some guys ship to us that's like insulated stuff but it's not going to make a huge difference. It's not common that the entire Midwest is in an Arctic freeze usually know we haven't talked much too many.  Yeah weather issues this year last couple anyway.  What do you want to carry in the store that you don't have yet? Yeah, I would say sailor is going to be are doing a rowing motion kind of throwing I could could answer that one for you. Yeah, I mean, yeah, I think Sailors the big one for us. Yeah and 2020. Yeah, that's the goal.  What do you want to know about lemur that makes you unique? I would say that we're an Enthusiast run company and because we've only been around for a few years and due to the kind of amount of scaling that we've done over the last few years. Just trying to carry things and products and brands that our customers want and kind of being involved in the pain pain Community trying to you know, make sure that  All at the pain meets and we're out there with our Outreach and then going to pain shows and getting to meet new people and see what everyone's kind of into and go from there. Yeah, I'd say that I started off with free shipping at 20 bucks being kind of the Cornerstone of what we're doing and excellent customer service and fast shipping mostly free shipping if possible and just trying to carry as much as many products as we can for people who are like really Independence.

We're going to let our friend Scott bowling tell you about his show Good Company. My name is Scott bowling have a show called Good Company good company is a show where we film artist in the Rock genre and we talked about the first record all the way to where there are. Now we've interviewed bands like Korn and seven us and Rich Ward. You can find me on YouTube Instagram Facebook under good company or good company with bowling. So please if you get a chance to check it out good company.    Welcome back to the Rob cast podcast. This is episode 8 numero. Ocho. How you doing, Richie? I'm good, man. How are you? Not bad. I am just hanging out at home. Yeah. I am too. Oh you were at home. We're not in the studio together. Nope. Today is a rainy phone day. It's yeah, it says it pouring by you. It was the last couple days bad enough where they actually have to shut down to streets.  Oh my God, because there's a little divot there. Oh and it flooded and it is a massive friggin flood.  Well so that I had to take another route to take my son to school. Oh, wow. Yeah. So anyway here we are eight episodes in we have a great show here today. We're going to be talking about  Our top five tours top five venues or just top tours and top venues, whatever we want to talk about. Yeah. So I mean I have done many many tours. It would be hard really to pick a top five because I've had more than five amazing tours.  And and venues have been so many that we have done that have come and gone. But you guys also do a lot of you know, you know your venues that you've played and you know, the venues that are going to be amazing. So when you guys go back to places like revolution in Florida or machine shop or you know, those are going to be sick Nonpoint shows. So those have to be in your top five. I mean the the Revolution being your home base, you know in a way  I do have a top five but I may do like some bonus venues sure because it's a little hard to pick but my my number one venue will always be revolution in Fort Lauderdale. I played it on the three names used to be called The Edge then it was called the chili pepper. Then it got changed to Revolution has been Revolution for for quite a while now, and it's just been amazing, too.  Be able to say that we have been able to sell out our hometown venue. I mean, it's probably a dream of every local band down there. And when I was local down there, I always play places like Club Q foobar culture room, but when it was the edge and then Chili Peppers and Revolution, that's the venue that you wanted to.  Be promoted to you know, and that was just I mean you've been there you've recorded shows there. We've done the Alive and Kicking DVD there we did the red pill their 20th anniversary. Yeah, we did a couple other things there and it's just one of the venues that I just hope it stays around forever. It's been  Pretty consistent. I was hoping that there were not be another name change or it would close down and so far. It's been killer and we're hoping to get back there in the fall to do another show with Mitch. Mr. Rocha may come down and record. Yeah, I'm always down to go to Florida as long as it's in cold weather in Chicago. I'll go wherever you guys are playing where it's warm, of course, and yeah, I mean revolution has been host to many many shows and they they have many different.  Genres in there not just rock and metal. They have reggae the of Comedy. They have all kinds of different stuff and I which I think has helped keep that club alive. Where a Jasmine just stuck to a certain genre where certain venues in Florida that just sticks to one genre, you know, and well that that area is is like all bunch of clubs. Like right next door was like some dance party going on right after you guys were playing and just like, yeah, there's a poor house right next to it. Yeah, there's fat cats.  Down the street where cover bands play. There's a lot of places there that Banks can play but Revolution is the spot. Oh, yeah, every local bands dream down there is to play Revolution and I am definitely proud to say we have sold that out quite a few times. Yeah, that's been really cool. It's awesome to see what that many people and they're all like, oh gee Nonpoint fans to you know over there. They really know everything you guys are going to do. That's why the 20th made so much sense for you guys to do there everybody knew everything you were going to play they came out of the woodwork.  Oh, yeah, I'm sure you saw people that you hadn't seen in a while and then you know people that have been there since the beginning so that's definitely got to be your top. It is definitely my top venue for anywhere that the second top venue would have to be the Machine Shop in Flint. I mean, we've been playing consistently there since 2002.  Yep, every single show is rolled. I mean the last 10 or 15 shows. I think I've been sold out. It's never failed no matter for opening of we're headlining. It also seems to be the the hottest Nonpoint shows like temperature-wise. Oh, yeah Place gets so hot when you guys are playing we played a show there a couple of years back and the air conditioner gone out that day and it was in the summer. Oh God.  And it was we were just about to start our tour with 10 years. We did a couple shows before meeting up with ten years and we played there. I mean, I must have burned the same amount of calories. I mean my clothes were soaked and then to put the knife even deeper in the situation the next time we play Frankie's in Toledo.  That was like a 350 cat place and that place was packed and in hot so two straight nights of hot venues and hot weather. Yeah Not only was it hot inside the venue was hot outside. So it was like no way of cooling down and but the a machine shop is an incredibly special place. We have a great relationship with Kevin. He is always down for us to come because he knows what's going to happen. We know.  It's going to happen. So and we have actually two shows recorder from there, which is the green pill that you actually can get on Nonpoint store.com. Mr. Rocha is the one responsible for recording and editing all the videos. So we thank you for your hard work as always sir.  And God more venues. I know those are my top two. I'm gonna talk about other venues. I can't put them in a number. I can just take the top two sure and I think the next venue that one Benny that is not around that I miss incredibly is the Pearl Room. It wasn't Mokena actually very close to my house. We played many shows there every single show.  That place was amazing. I mean it was like just a half hour train ride from Chicago. The train station was right next to it. So there were it was such a amazing situation for anybody coming from the north anybody coming from the south. You can ride the train to the show. You got hungry after the show. There was a Danny's right there if you got tired and want to drive anywhere there was a hotel right there. So and and for all the gym rats it was a gym right there. So a lot of musicians went up there, too.  Work out. There's a gym right next to the Danny's. There was a White Castle and awesome sushi place. I mean, there's all kinds of stuff there that I mean, I don't personally like White Castle, but I know a lot of people that do ya and there was a great situation and was run by Frank. Yeah from FN from FM. I mean, he booked so many amazing shows. We played to a Sevendust we played there with  Hell yeah sold out to the max. Both of those shows headlined a bunch of shows actually Disturbed played there as indestructible.  Oh like a hit secret name thing. Yeah secret name and the show is sold out. I mean pact that think just right before indestructible came out or something. I think it was like a kind of a surprise probably their way of warming up for their tour. Yeah, something like that. It was amazing. I didn't get to go that shot just heard about it. I wasn't living here at the time. But man I will say that that place was as I miss it because it's just until literally 10 minutes from my house and it was  It would be killer it for it to still be there. And I think people try to keep it open. Even Dan Donegan was one of the people involved in being I guess an investor to keep the place open with Frank, but I think the village was not interested at I believe there might have been a shooting there. I'm not 100% sure. I think there was a hip-hop show and there was a shooting so I think the village just got scared of concerts all together and but that's one venue.  You that I wish were still around but I'll tell you some of yours. Let's see. I mean with the Touring that from 0 did we had, you know a couple of really unique chances to tour with some bands that I had never thought we would tour with for example, we played a good tour out in the East Coast with the cult and that was where we played Lupo's which you played there. I don't think it's called Lupo's anymore. I think they changed the name, but it's called The Strand. Yeah, it was in Providence, but it was such a great.  Great show because you get people from Boston coming out and that was one of the the best East Coast venues that we played the West Coast. We played the House of Blues in LA and it was the coolest House of Blues that ever seen the second floor bar actually parted when the show came on like I don't know it was like motorized it was the coolest thing I've ever seen. So we played their well, that was a great show because it was with Run DMC. So it was, you know, amazing to be at a House of Blues outside of Chicago.  We had played there and all the House of Blues is are very, you know, accommodating and amazing to their their artists. So that's a good reason to you know, play those places. So I mean, I really kind of you know from zero didn't do an extensive amount of touring we were only around for a couple of years. So we didn't get an experience like you've had where you've played every place at least twice probably, you know, and that can give you an opinion better on you know, what venues are really cool. Like you said the last 10 or so shows it  Jean shop. I mean we played machine shop once and it was right when it opened in 2002, but the you know, the the venues that we got when we were on the Godsmack Deft own tour those were all arenas. So I mean when you ask for, you know a venue, I mean God me we played Red Rocks that to me was the best thing you could ever do so I would say that you know while you definitely have a lot more repeat visits to all these places.  We had that opportunity to get on such a big arena tour and with Deftones and Godsmack which was going to pull no matter what Coast we were on it was West Coast Deftones East Coast Godsmack always playing in front of you know, thousands of people so every show of those I could say was the favorite but Red Rocks definitely tops the arena venues. What about your Arena venues? I mean, you've played definitely big festivals Arenas you've done, you know, I saw you guys in Springfield at a pretty good-sized arena with Disturbed, but I  If that's you know on your list, well, we definitely played Red Rocks once awesome. We played it was a radio show Stabbing Westward was headlining.  It was not Point head PE clutch and Stabbing Westward. Wow. Remember that what I don't remember there was other bands but man all I could think of is Sunday Bloody Sunday by you too. And when I walked in there and I got on that stage and I looked out and all I could do was a holy shit. Hmm. Like oh my God, I can't believe I'm playing this place, you know because Chic if you see the video for Sunday Bloody Sunday the librarian for you to you see all the stuff going around.  I'm like mass at cool-looking place and back then I didn't really know I wasn't touring I wasn't signed. I had no idea what the place was or if what kind of History it had how famous it was or that stuff and when I walked on the stage, I'm like, oh my God. This is the place.  Were you two did that video and I was just like just so like like the emotion that came over me and like man I am I can put this on my list, you know, I can definitely say that it was a wonderful experience. The only thing that suck was going up and down that hill Oh my God. Yeah. I think we had to go if I walked at once up.  And I'm like, I'm not doing this for rent for the whole day. So I basically you had a van that would bring you down and then Vanna will take you back up. There was no way I was walking that. So the second time I went up I stayed there till the show is over. I grabbed my stuff from the bus and I said, I'm not walking down here until we leave so that was an incredible incredible memory another great venue that I played and eat and and the definitely not around anymore. We got to  Cbgb's. Yeah, we did to one time for the cmj music marathon and it is as rugged as people to explain it to be I mean who ever talked about it? There was they people did not lie about that venue about that. What about the toilet the bath? Yeah, because you were like you were like taking a shit on a throne like a king a throne of Filth. That's right Throne of felt, but I'll tell you what the the  vibe in that place that show that we played and another place. I walked into I was like, oh my God, I cannot stick front displayed here the kromaggs Blondie everyone moans the police Talking Heads to all these bands played on this raggedy-ass stage and the posters on the walls were stacked on top of each other so much that it was smaller than it originally was because the walls kept shrinking from a layers and layers of  Post it to me. I always associated cbgb's with the New York hardcore scene. Yeah, because they have the Sunday matinees. Like even though I know a lot of bands played there what really made that place famous I think really was in New York hardcore scene and I can say hey I did it and I wish it was still around so I can play with Nonpoint now there. Oh, yeah because I can imagine the insanity that it would be and when we were a virtually unknown  Known band but that show opened an insane amount of doors for us. I mean we went up there and we threw it down like we were just like it was like the last show of our life and our manager came up to us in the back. I don't remember that was a backstage or whatever. He kisses you guys have no idea what you've done and I said, what do you mean I said you guys just destroyed that stage. These people are out there buzzing about you guys, and I'm like, well, I mean that's that's what we're supposed to do.  You know, so it was killer to be able to say that and say hey I played cbgb's you know, yeah, we got that opportunity when we were featured on the MTV Real World season 10 thing and all the kids on that season worked for Arista records. So it was like our label in New York and we gotta show it Seabees they came out they filmed it. They you know had Mike which is the The Miz now in the WWE he was on that season. He came out of  Announced us I mean drunk as heck but still I mean it was a party and then afterwards we went to the real world apartment and hung out with them. And I mean, it was almost surreal to get to that point at such an early stage in our career and it was lucky, you know, because of that season 10 thing being hooked up with Arista records, but to be able to say that you played Seabees and I mean, that's the same thing as red rocks and that's one of the reasons I think that you know with you and I meeting 20-something, you know, 20 years ago or whatever we've  Similar paths, you know, like as far as you know, we've we can always talk like about the Webster in Connecticut. We can talk about you know, like oh my God. Yeah, you know like playing they're playing its TVs playing at Red Rocks. I mean, I never got to play The Whiskey you guys have done that that would be one of my bucket list to be able to see like that picture you guys had in front of the whiskey with your name on that Marquee that had never that never gets old. I was going to say yeah that has to be on your list. I mean, you played the whiskey like the doors  I played the whiskey and and Halen. Oh my God everybody. I mean that was that was the strip during the hair metal band days. Everybody was playing the rainbow the Roxy the whiskey, you know, like everything was just star-studded Rockstar strip. So yeah, I mean, that's definitely yes Seabees. Was that East Coast hardcore trashy place that if you played their people thought wow, you played cbgb's you know, that's pretty cool. I wish I would have gotten a t-shirt from there me too because those I'm sure they still  Salim so yeah, but now it's like you're just trending you know, like oh, I gotta see video be sure but if you got it from playing there, you know, like that would be something yeah there. It means a lot more. Yeah. It's like a badge of honor. Yeah, so and yeah, man, I mean God there's the House of Blues in Orlando another place. That was great show. That's actually my favorite house of not not to knock on any of the House of Blues. That's my personal favorite because of the connection we have with Orlando and WJR are well.  It's also like attached to like the Disney Village, isn't it? Like it's yeah, it's on Disney property. Remember when I came out to record you guys. Yeah, totally and it was actually all every single House of Blues is killer, but that was the one that I have a special connection with and I've been able and I've played every House of Blues now, I finally got that off The Bucket List when we played Boston nice Allison Dallas and Houston, we were able to play and San Diego we played it, LOL.  We want the last bands to play that House of Blues in La. Yeah, and there was a we played that with 36 Crazy Fist and scared on fear, and that was a great show, too.  Irving Plaza is another venue that I like playing the Hammerstein Ballroom in New York. Oh God amazing show. I played there with fuel and Sevendust. It was I mean over sold out place was insane. I'm trying to think what other venues I mean. I've played so many. What about the Majestic in Madison great venue as well. And I'm proud of course. Yeah. It's a very personal type of n, you know, like and the Raven Milwaukee. I think I can say I played every single room  That venue except one. I played the upstairs with fuel and Sevendust sold out. I mean insane the only time on our way, we played it with Disturbed sold out. Oh, yeah, II am a all my God to amazing shows killed it on merch on the top place on the top. Yeah. That's the big I got to play that I got the I would love to play there again and film that oh man. Yeah, that would be insane but they do have rules about filming there. So, yeah, but  The House of Blues in Boston as right now right behind Fenway Park awesome venue. I got to play their of twice once with Megadeth. And once with Alter Bridge both killer shows. Did you guys play Saint Andrews Hall? Yes, we did sold-out show at Taproot. I was in off date on the Ozzfest and that was a great venue and walk downstairs. Saw the shelter. That's where you know where yeah, we did the shelter once as well mile 8 Mile was filmed. I believe down there. We did our show there was sold.  Show with soil so is our buddy Sean Sean Sean glass and and from 0 degree 1 degree of shot glass that mean that was where I we did a tour with soil. We did like a two week stint with them actually right when 9/11 had happened and it was we played a show in Ohio on the 13th of September in 2001, and we literally played for soil and soil played for us. There was nobody out. Nobody went anymore. Nobody and nobody was it was everybody was still  Very much in shock. Yeah, but as we both know the show must go on, you know, because absolute music is an escape for people if anybody wanted to I mean the bar staff showed up and so we performed for soil and the bar staff and they performed for us and the bar staff and needless to say we had an open tab that night that we didn't have to settle up with because everybody was just like in that camaraderie of we know we survived something terrible. There's another venue Norva in Norfolk. Oh, yeah, we played there. That's a  It's got like the hot tub upstairs a for different showers got the one of the best dressing rooms I've ever seen and area for the band's they got ping pong. I believe that pool have some video games and they have like a basketball court on the third floor and that great stage Great Sound awesome food around are a mall across the street tons of restaurants. Yep, and that, you know, and I based a lot on  The venue with also with what's around it and stuff like that lately that makes that whole experience not only going to have a killer show, you know, you're going to have killer food around there. So when you play machine shop, everybody goes to Big John mmm, you know and buys that you know, I don't buy it from there, but I know so many people that buy so that's the first thing that BC does when he gets off the bus Beef goes and gets himself that bigjon and then comes back and regret. So I used to buy them way back in the day until I change my eating.  But that's one that's when you know, you know, you're going to have a good sandwich and there's an awesome Deli across the street called the Brooklyn Deli that has awesome breakfast that I always go to but yeah, and another venue that I really like actually is a Scout Bar in Houston, which were playing in the fall. I'm hearing so I don't know and they have like the awesome staff killer lights decent-sized stage really good stage for what we do.  A lot of people come out to those shows there. We can always get four to five hundred out there, which is killer and they have Ichiban across the street killer sushi French. He's one of the best Italian places you're ever going to go to you can ask BC about that. I have a ramen noodle place next to it. That's amazing. I can and you just you know, you know, there's one of those places, you know, the shows going to be is going to go off, you know, and we've had so many amazing shows there. There's a used to be as place them down.  It's called The Canyon Club. Oh, yeah, we played there. I played it with head p and with a very young unsigned Drowning Pool opening up and then we played the Bronco bowl that was next to it. Yep with fuel and Sevendust and that's when I met dime bag and Vinny. That's the bowling alley. That was a venue to right? Yeah, amazing God of great. We had we played there with Drowning Pool as well because Drowning Pool was so big in Texas. Yeah. We had amazing shows their places.  Sadly not around anymore. And there's also there's also trees and Dallas would kill her. Mmm. I like that place to I'm truly trying to think what other venues that I really really love. We did the Norva II remember you're saying like the whole dressing room area that was on our tour with nothing face. And that was amazing. Like the venue was great. The people were great. The crowd was great opening up for nothing face was amazing and I like it's those memories that  Never forget when you've had those experiences of who you've played with where you've played, you know, and how many times you've been able to do it like, you know with with only two years of touring under my belt it was you know, some repeats like the Norva a couple times and you know Lupo's a couple times with the different tours that we were on so with you guys. I've noticed it the venue owners loved having you, you know, like because they they respect you guys. You respect the venue's everybody's happy in those situations like  like almost all the places. I've come out to record their so accommodating to let me set up and do my thing because it's you guys, you know, and like Kevin from machine shop. No problem, even though that place is almost like with the Fillmore is you know, like where people had those live at the Fillmore recording so legendary things there could be live at the machine shop and it would be something you know, like you wouldn't believe I think people would really get into that and some bands would probably make some good money selling that yeah. I mean it  Doesn't get like clutch Dead live at machine shop and they have their own merch there. You know, it's like that's kind of the only venues that almost outsells bands every night in their own merch and they give the band's the discount on merch which is a major so many bands that I know that has at least one machine shop shirt. I've seen him all the time. Yeah. It's like a tradition and you go there. I mean every time we go there somebody in our crew or someone is going over there and check out the merch and leaving leaving with like five or six things.  Things because it's half price for the for the bands and crew. It's like if you have that laminate it's like your discount past and I mean, you don't have to go shopping in a mall across the street which is a dead mall anyway, but they have amazing clothes. Yeah. So I mean I said, we've played so many that a lot of close down a lot of still around, you know, the Chicago House of Blues we've done. Yeah, it's been great great to play there.  The House of Blues in New Orleans has been great. Oh, yeah, like I we played everywhere every one of those places. That's the first House of Blues the one in New Orleans. It's got like the chatelet the shutters on the outside and I think technically what I heard first House of Blues was in Atlanta now, it's called The Tabernacle. Oh, right, right. Yes. Yeah. That was right. Well because they play twice with Sevendust amazing. The one in New Orleans has a second venue called The Parish, which is we played there with the with the cult that was  Freaking awesome show like a little play a little tiny stage, but it was killer. Yeah, I've just been so thankful and blessed to be able to play all these places, you know, and and  and be able to continue to go back to these places. And then since I've we started there's so many new venues that have opened that you know, I'm sure that we will visit, you know, and another venue to Rams Head live in Baltimore soundstage there in Baltimore killer killer venues. What would Frank the Frank did the the forge here in Joliet? Yeah, which was amazing venue. Yes, Mojo's and it was called the tree for a while and for just bringing so many shows there and Frank has done an amazing job. Yeah. He took that place for mode.  As and made it amazing. Like I remember you guys played Mojo's and it was like almost not to say anything bad about it, but compared to the forge my God. Yeah, you know like it's like a palace now. Yeah, we are so we've played so many so many different places that I'm just thankful and blessed to be able to say hey, I played these places, you know, and and many tours are we've been on there so many tours that we've been on going to these places, you know, and  You know as far as tours, you know, like my favorite all-time tour will always be the 2001 Ozzfest. Yeah, there's not going to be another tour that will outdo that one just because the fact that we knew 90% of the Bands. We were done every day by 11:20.  And by 1:30 our day was over that's when we finished doing all the signings or Jagermeister and FYE. Hmm. And then from then on all the buses from the second stage were always Park together. There was a barbecue every day. Like they were people cooking every day. You see people different band members going to different buses. It was such it's like a just a summer camp of metal and it was just so amazing like and you see bands from the main stage. They had this little  Motorized scooters all these bands have the scooters on there. So all the Papa Roach guys slip knot Dave Draiman the Lincoln Park is all those guys came to the second stage every day to watch the the second stage bands and it was an amazing experience to be able I mean, I saw Black Sabbath every day for two months. Yeah, like right there with Tony Iommi in front of me. How can I not say this was like not the best tour of My Life.  You know is we were the first band actually confirmed for the StreetWise stage and that was just exciting when I got that phone call, like holy shit of you're serious. I'm going to play at or that I've been going to for the last three years, you know, I went to all the Ozzfest to get the name out there before we were saying that ended all the Ozzfest and it was just amazing. Just amazing to say. Oh my God. I'm playing the Ozzfest and it Sharon was super nice like her.  Was super nice. I mean the world of security for the tour big vowel actually who was Pantera's security who sadly passed away. He was a super cool guy big scary looking do but a hard Heart of Gold, you know is really nice really sweet guy. And I meant just the camaraderie that we have with all the bands when we hung out with Taproot and pressure for five and spine shank every day. And we did off dates with spine with yes Pine check. I think we're on  a couple of the updates that were mainly all with Taproot and Drowning Pool pressure for 500 tip and systematic. Those were the bands that were doing the off dates with us and hat like you knows Johnny pull did half and there's another Bandit another half and just like just the only thing that sucked about that tour.  Was the fact that we had to play after Hatebreed every day. Oh my God, and I mean they were pummeling that crowd but at pumped us up, you know, we went out there. That's what we were selling records were selling thousands and thousands of Records a week. It was just amazing man. I got to experience the selling of albums that that huge massive like worldwide known festival and just the fact that who was on it. I mean, I'll mainstage you had Disturbed but  They headlined the first and the second stage there were so many people over there because it was our second year in a row them doing it. There are still were already massive for it, you know sickness and stupefy there were so many people they actually got promoted to the main stage from the second show on because there were just too many people for security to handle and they figured that was going to happen every day. So Mudvayne took over the headlining slot and I mean you had  Disturb Black Label Society Linkin Park, Papa Roach Crazy Town Slipknot Marilyn Manson and Black Sabbath on the main stage. Wow. I mean, come on. It's like holy crap well, and if you're done early you get to see those those bands like, you know from a different like point of view. You said you went for, you know years to promote Nonpoint at Ozzfest, but you never got to stay inside stage. No. No, that was one of the biggest like thrills as you know touring with with bands.  You've always wanted to tour with is you got to see them from wherever you wanted and every night when we were on the Godsmack Deftones door. I took a different perspective. I was like, I want to stand by the crowd. I hid my laminate and I stood in the crowd and then I was like now I want to watch Stephen from the side, you know, I went and watched him play a whole show and basically was like 10 feet away from him and that's something that you know you and I have had the luck and the blessing of being able to do and you know, when you get some of those like VIP experiences where people get to do that, I'm glad  The bands are offering that because it's a total different perspective of you know, what a band is doing, you know, and a lot of times you get to see some you know of the camaraderie that the band has amongst themselves that you never get to see from the, you know, crowd point of view like when the band comes out and they go out on stage. Like I've noticed you guys I'll do that fist bump thing that you do before you go out there and it's, you know to know that you guys aren't just going out there as a job and I've seen that with a lot of bands because of that side-stage.  Did you know they go out there and they're all just their homes before they go out there. They go out. They do a show they come out and they you know high-five each other if it was a good show. That's something that those tours especially like the Ozzfest tour for you. And your the I mean ours was only four bands. It was gobsmacked up tones puddle of Mud and us and so it was a small but yet Arena tour and every day the catering every day everybody sat around, you know, during our sound checks Chino would go longboarding right by our  Stage just watching us do our sound check and it was like the first time that happened. I was like, oh crap chinos watching. It's like now we just started performing. We started jumping around and sound check. Yeah because you want to impress those guys, you know, like that's totally totally one of the biggest memories of Ozzfest. We're playing Indiana Indianapolis that Amphitheater there. We were in catering probably everybody. I say like probably 70% of at least one member of every band was in there. Mmm, and then Marilyn Manson and to  You walked in the whole room went silent. Yeah, I mean completely silent. You can hear a needle drop. That's when you know like yeah, I'm a rock star I'm saying that from the perspective of Marilyn Manson. Oh, yeah, like he walked in and said, yeah, I made this whole room go quiet. Oh, of course because nobody really used to see him he what he wasn't out and about all the time, you know, and the he walked in there with Twiggy and the whole I mean dude the whole room  Stop talking like almost like holy shit. There's Marilyn Manson, you know that that was a cool experience and another cool experiences like on that tour like one but last day Sharon threw a party she had like magicians and all kinds of different kinds of people like doing these parties and then the draw singer Mike Shinoda from Lincoln Park with what  He was he was walking with me. So everybody watch out League drummer coming through lady drummer coming through lead drummer Les drummer. He always called me lead drummer. I mean him and Chester were love them point. I rest in peace Chester. Oh, yeah, they would always call me lead drummer and I remember a show in Fort Lauderdale. I'm sorry, Miami played the Bonsai festival and Lincoln Park was playing there were behind me. Literally a foot behind me give him  Massages while I was playing. Oh my God that it was funny because I was playing forward that day. I don't know why but I was waiting for that day and and they just kept giving me massages because I was hitting the drums so hard and so here we're here to help you dude. We're here to help you. That was one of the coolest things on those early tours in like 2000 2001. I mean the band's hadn't blown up to a point where they were Untouchable yet, you know, like they they were so normal everyday.  Read a guys like we would go on Deftones bus we would go on God's MAX bus the guitar player from Godsmack Tony and and Pete from from zero would be playing Flamenco music in the dressing room, like on nylon strings. Like it was not it wasn't rock star, you know, like it totally changed my perspective of like what I grew up believing was all sex drugs and rock and roll and it was really like like you said barbecues and hangouts and you know, just like anybody else is world, but just  In a much more lime lighted way, you know and and you wrote on a bus everywhere and you know, you had that luxury that people dreamed of when they were, you know, growing up as musicians another memory from that Ozzfest. We had two days in Detroit the play two shows and the night.  The first night we all went to the hotel. So Black Label Society there was like six or seven buses and parking lot were all hanging out with black label. We're hanging out with Zakk Wylde, and he was pounding beers. I was back then when he was drinking pounding beers and and I was so scared talking to him because he's such an intimidating guy, but but I sat there and talk to him we exchanged stories and what nice as you want to hear unless you want to listen to the new Ozzy.  Yeah, I was with no vocals. Oh, yeah. Absolutely. That was I didn't say want to say no, but it was cool to hang out with him. But I was like literally scared to death that he was going to hit me or something because he was just so like intense, you know, and but he was a sweetheart of a guy at the same time and as super cool dude, and that was I like something I'll never forget. I got to hang out with Zach and that's awesome. You know, it's just really cool to be able to share those experiences and and I said the off  Every day you saw some you saw somebody every day walking around. That was not your there was no way you were not going to see someone that I said Raymond would come over every day to watch us and we actually we filmed our indoor video at Ozzfest and the Union underground's in the video Dave a CJ got some Mudvayne Jack Osbourne and all these people are in the video Chester's in the video Johnny from spine checks in the video. We asked all these guys for permission to be in the video and it  it's just I said still my favorite video we've ever done because of the whole vibe that was created behind it. Yeah, and it came from that that you know world of Ozzfest, you know thing to so Disturbed Stone Sour and Flyleaf was an amazing tour to music as a weapon 3. I mean we were out with the number 1 and number 2 Band in the country who they were on the same tour and then finally for killing on the charts and we hired to the pain record. I mean we had an amazing time on that tour.  Who has all arenas I'd say pretty much every show except one was sold out which I think was Jacksonville, Florida. Well that and but all the other shows were amazing amazing amazing shows and I had a great time on that tour. I mean, we almost home almost got kicked off that tour because we were in I think we're in Dayton, Ohio and we had a guitar tech kind of freak we call them guillot and  Because you just say our Ghoulia is time. I like that song our guillot and we so we called him guillot from then on it was his native Ross. I was doing Ross and we were we were I was at merch and apparently somebody spit somebody from the crowd spit on and er guitarist. Oh wow, and then go low grab the bottle and threw it out to the guy which dumb decision guy was on the crowd wind up hitting the lady.  Find him and her I was completely swollen and then no disturb had to make man's you know, they gave her merch all this other stuff. We thought everything was smooth over. We had it off date in Huntington West Virginia. Then we had a show in Nashville. Then we go to Nashville were told to stay on our bus.  And when I got a crap what happened, so the apparently the the grid the lady woke up the next day with her eyes swollen shut. I mean completely just really and I'm not sure that was any threats of suing or anything but we we we were like we were told to stay on the bus. So we had to fire our guitar tech or I believe we were going to go have to go home. Well, that's that's when you fire the guitar tech. Yeah. We it said see you dude. Great gray, dog. Mmm. Yeah. See I do the worst.  To about it as he had his girl there. She left in that same day two so man, so let's suck that. So anyway anyway, so and Mikey kept always teasing me. Hey, you guys gotta settle down. I'll be so tough as it did we had nothing to do with it. Yeah, he offer he would always give me shit and was always teasing me about it and it was funny, you know, but that was like the only time that I think we can close to getting kicked off at or about something that we didn't even do it was a  um decision and if any guitar takes out there get drum text anybody don't throw anything in the crowd trust me. Yeah. Well the consequences are very bad. Well beyond that, I mean your representative of the band so you have to have that same level of professionalism and you know you no modesty. You can't be a dick one of one of my favorite memories that we were you're talking about, you know hanging out in hotels and stuff with during the Haas Fest and  And Zach while hanging out and stuff when we were we did some tours with with stained and Drowning Pool and some other you know, like all those Festival shows that we would do and we were at this hotel and all the guys from stained were at one end and Drowning Pool guys were in the middle and we were at the other end of the hotel and CJ from drowning pool was walking up and down the hallways singing. It's been a while but he changed the lyrics to It's been a while since I've had beer the camaraderie that we've had with bands like 7 to us All That Remains hell, yeah.  Mudvayne Sumo psycho, like just to name a few. I mean we've had great relationships with these people pod now have now after all these years you finally get to do touring with pod and that tour we did last year was easily one of my favorites as well because of not only the shows were great at camaraderie was amazing and it's just the whole vibe of the bands was just killer, you know, and it was just a good thing to have you know, when  On those tours just be able to hang out every single day doing something whatever, you know, you know having a beer with your butt with them or you're taking a shot or just bullshit and talk about music talk about life. How can you know if they have families another know a lot of these bands now, you know now that we're all fathers we can talk to other people about families, you know, we have so much so much to talk about now outside of just, you know, hanging out get drunk. Let's party. You know now we can have like these real life meaning  Ation, and like real real conversations with people and exchange stories and and exchange what how they deal with stuff at home, you know and conversations. These days is a lot different than once back in the day. Oh, yeah. I mean the Godsmack guys we'd like on off days. We they would go ride Harley's there's a couple times that they went to a hockey rink with RTM because RTM was from Canada and he was looking to play hockey. So Robbie the bass player from Godsmack took him to a skating place nearby and Massachusetts and  They went played hockey for a while. Like I mean normal things like things that you you know don't equate with being on a Rock Tour, you know, it's like what you do on your day off. It's like, oh we went hiking and it's like that normal people go hiking. You know, it's like white. It's kind of the same. It's just you get those opportunities to be in those places because you're on tour. You've gotten to see Europe you've gotten to see Australia you've gotten to see, you know, many parts of the world that you know normal, you know everyday working people aren't going to have that opportunity unless it's a vacation  But in your life, it's your job. And I like that's part of your gig like you're gonna go play in Australia. You're getting paid to do it. You have to spend money to get there. But you're going to you know be it's a business you're going as like, you know, you had to do it for work, but you also get to see some really cool stuff. Yeah. I mean one of the favorite things that we've also done it wasn't a tour. We actually just a couple shows with five finger and drowning pool at the one at the Webster and  They wccc was still around and they did a contest with fans to play paintball. So we play so we play paintball at five finger and Drowning Pool. And that was a lot of fun. I was super fucking tired by the end of it because all the crouching and running I wasn't ready for all that, but it was an awesome like experienced like that. We were able to do stuff with other bands like that. You know, we've done bowling with All That Remains, you know,  No, we when we were out with in this moment. We did like a shared VIP and that was really cool to like ya know. That's another band. We've had a good relationship with In This Moment. Yeah, great shows at them great people, you know, and I really can't, you know, I can't complain about my career or my life despite. You know, we've had some struggles like most bands. Do you know you have your issues with you know with just the industry in general I mean, but the touring side  And I think that being able to meet not only band members, but you meet promoters. You meet radio station People You Meet fans are so much advantage.  Of going on torque as there is life long relationships that you helped build and you for you form and help build and there's no replacing something like that. You know, like that's just not like like me and you have this amazing relationship now and we I mean, we only did one short tour, but you know, it's just like put that short or that's on my list of yeah that that because it was Mudvayne and you guys I mean, it's yeah, I know that's that's  Tour, we got the meat and then years later. I said we come full circle here. We are doing a podcast together. Yeah, you know, I like and so it's everything comes full circle when it comes to touring as I mean, I still have contact with bands that are no longer but some of the members I still have contact with there's no need to stop talking to these people just because you're not in a band. That's not the reason you talk to me. Try to guess you really have become a friend. Yeah, and you have developed a friendship like I still talk religiously to  Jared from Taproot. I mean, I love that dude. He is one of the best people I've ever met BC the original drummer had PE. I still have an amazing relationship with him. I mean two guys that I've still to this day I talked to and they're not in bands anymore. They I mean they've gone on to do different things but we've built such a great relationship that they've always and they still come to our shows when we come into town. I saw BC at her Vegas show at Jared came to one of our last show.  Michigan and it's just great to have those relationships still intact. Yeah. I know what you mean. There's there's some of those relationships that ended up, you know benefiting me in the studio like, you know being able to work with people that would have probably not looked at me as a viable option for engineering or production. But because I came from you know a band that was touring with other bands that you know, they either had toured with or they liked I mean I've gotten you know the opportunities to  to work with you guys and I've gotten opportunities to work with these twins that were in a band called the blank Theory here from Chicago and you know, they were they were signed to new line Cinema and that was like a really, you know tail end of the Chicago signing movement. They were one of the last bands that got a deal out of here, but you know, they came back to me with other bands. They were in a band called Medina Lake which was on razor and tie when you when you guys were on and they came they came to me for some drum tracking and recording and you know, it's really  Given me an opportunity to you know, start working with a-listers right off the bat, you know, because I came from that world where you form those friendships and Bonds were people remember you from you know the tour but then they also respect you because you've moved on and now you're doing the other side of the glass you're helping bands like you said in and one of our first episodes, you know, it's it's the engineers and producers that give the band's the outlet, you know, like here guys. I'm going to capture this lightning that you're putting.  Down and you know, let the fans here this because they've never heard you like this before, you know kind of thing and in the live setting it's a totally different thing every show I've recorded for you guys live is different Dynamics, you know, like the crowds are different there sometimes more, you know aggressive more Rowdy. There's sometimes more sing-songy with you with you guys where you can get them to react more and you form different bonds from the different sides of that business. I mean, you would have never had Chad Gray on miracle if you wouldn't have toured with  Vain, you know, it's like how would you get someone like that at that point when Mudvayne was really hot and they had you know big records and it's like if you would have tried to do that as a band that you know never played with them. He would have been like who you know, like instead of like hell. Yeah. I want to be your producer on this record. I want to you know help you with this. I want to sing on this stuff. I want to make this miracle record big and you know, then he was on serious the other day taking over turbo and he's of course playing on point because you know,  it's that connection. Yeah, I mean and you know, we saw him on ship rocked and he came out on stage came out on stage during bullet were the first band he stepped on stage with and he you know a couple days later he sang with the stowaways was able to sing blind with had on guitar, which is killer. Oh, yeah, and and that mean we still have that awesome connection. I had a great connection with him on Shiprock that song gave me a huge hug, you know, it was great to see him and he had come out a month or two before.  to the Vegas show when we  Play with POD at the Hard Rock and it was.  I just great to see him great to see him, you know still doing it and new hell yes song Us fire. I mean amazing. Yeah amazing track. I mean and I we I said we still had that relationship and once he heard bullet, he said man, I know this song, you know, he came up there and he's whispering in my ear while I'm playing in the bridge. I'm like go get a mic I go get a bike and he went up there and just lost his mind and I was a very special moment and I mean in our relationship with China.  I goes back to 2000 and now we're talking 19 years. We've known that guy we were on mud veins very first tour Ultra spanked Mudvayne an OnPoint as like one of the one of definitely one of my favorite tours to and possibly could that we still have a relationship with all those guys. I mean every single one of those guys we see them. It's always a hey man, how you been good to see you type of vibe. You know, it's never been anything weird like chat and Greg has been the one to guys.  We've been you know have our biggest relationship with you. Yeah, and well, there's that great picture that came from ship rocked of Elias and Chad, you know buttin heads with microphones and you know, it's like one of those things I looked at from a different angle. I mean, I guess a lot of fans would look at it and say oh that's cool singer of Mudvayne and hell, yeah and the singer of nonpoint but I see two guys that are friends, you know, like they spent time together in ways that most people would never do you created together.  No as vocalists, they bonded on a level that you know, you can see in that picture. It's like it's like as if almost the picture could be captioned like what's up, homie, you know like not even like, you know, let's do something big. It's like now let's just do what we like to do and have fun doing it because we've been doing this for almost two decades and we've known each other for that long and you know, why not? You know, it's like that's something that I don't know how much the fans realize how cool that moment was, you know, because from from a  person on the other side like I do, you know know about that relationship. It's like man, that's really cool. There's a picture of a hug from him with Elias at you know, it's illegitimate. Yeah and it and it means something when I saw that picture I got I was overwhelmed with emotions. Yeah me too knew I knew what was going on in their minds the fact that he came on stage with us and had not been on stage since the unfortunate passing of any it's definitely one of those moments Where You Are  Or Elias or you know anybody that knew how long it's been and who had played with those people and who you know have lost the I mean the the industry lost the one of the best drummers the music scene lost one of the best drummers the fans lost one of the best drummers, but when you get guys were like we lost Brothers, you know, like that's something deeper.  I mean when you know someone that close, you know, and you have shared tours with stories with a shot. Yeah, a meal hot meal every everything that right there. It hits home that but I said those relationships, you know, like a we built with Chad from touring, you know has still stands today. You know, it's something that that's probably it most definitely going to stand forever. Yeah, you know, it's no reason not to  Even if we're not in bands anymore, I'm still going to see Chad and give him a hug guess because it's just there's so much history and so much Sevendust. We have such a long relationship with those guys like so many things that have happened to them have happened to us. We've toured so many times played so many off dates together. We have Clint working with us, you know. Yeah. I've actually  Texted Morgan for advice, you know like and it's just good to have that relationship same with Machine Head and I have a great relationship with Phil demmel from touring their relationship with Ralph Lane. I just text her rifle in two days ago asking advice about certain things, you know, as as great that know that I can shoot a text to a guy that I didn't really necessarily grow up with but we found the bond through music. Yep, and you know, basically my text was about business, but he took  I'm out of his day. He actually called me.  And we talked on the phone about certain some things. You know, it's like I said touring and all this this is what you you you tour for you build this stuff. Like you become friends with these people. Like I hate like when bands compete we're all at this all should be a Brotherhood. Yeah, you know, like everybody we're out here doing the same thing trying to accomplish the same thing and I can say I can a lot of these people I can call my brother's, you know, absolutely sisters, you know, and and  It's been I mean an absolute just I mean, I'm just floored just the fact that I've had the career that I've had. I can't I just can't I just no way I can complain friends of mine asked me if I played like the Powerball or the Mega Millions lottery and I look at them and I'm like, I've won life's lottery I get to do what I love and I get paid to do it, you know, like if that's all you need to do in life if you're happy with your career and you're happy with what you're doing. Then you're you've made it, you know, like you've won that Lottery.  I don't totally I mean it's like I'm doing what I love it's not I mean I didn't go to school for this. I didn't you know, I don't have a bachelor's degree. I dropped out of high school. I don't really have much of an education but I'm doing what I love and I can't there's no way that I can look back and say I regret I have no regrets. I've actually had arguments with friends when they bitch about their jobs. I can't I mean  What can I what can I bitch about the thing is there is your problems with my job sure. There's problems with everybody but I'm doing what I want. I set up and do one thing was to get signed. Hmm go on tour and make a living playing music and that's what I'm still doing to this day how they granted everybody. You know that the landscape has changed people do other Ventures outside of their band some Stark clothing. So I'm start labels. I'm sorry management company some start podcasts. Yeah becomes dark podcast.  You know because we want to win not only that we want to stay busy, you know, like, you know, we want to stay out there. I mean, I'm not doing this podcast for money, you know doing this because it's a great outlet Great release for me to talk about music and talk about all the positive stuff that has happened all the amazing venues. I've played all the amazing promoters that I've been able to play.  For continue to book us to this day like guys like laying on an old Kevin like Randy Hawk always books is for the festival's yeah, you build these relationships with these people. That's just to name a few there's many more sure but you know, there's build these relationships, you know relation with the other bands. Hey, let's do a tour. Hey come sing on my song. Hey, let's go out on the day off. Let's go bowling. Let's have a barbecue. We did that last year with pod in the middle of  Shit's Bill, Texas on Thanksgiving. Yeah, I'm Thanksgiving. We bought meet with turkey hot dog. Okay, but we ate hotdogs and but we were hanging out together. Yeah and have an amazing time together. You know what that's probably one of my best thanksgivings that I've ever had because I was hanging out with pod. We had a great time. We were just all bonding a different kind of family. Yeah, you know still family. You have two families have your home family you have your road?  Yep, you know like I all my guys in my band those guys are my brothers till the end all in your crew is your driver and I mean, yeah Chuck everything my drum tagged item, you know, we have Casey know Dustin comes out with us Jesse Justin, you know Justin like they're all family to us, you know, sometimes they can't make certain tours but they're always family. You know, it doesn't matter to Lena. Who's our Black Label Society. Consider her family. Yeah. I'm I love all these people to death.  When they've been amazing to us and I said I can't complain. I mean well I do I wish things were better in the industry. Absolutely. Everybody does at the end of the day. I'm still doing what I want. So that's all we can. Hope for man. Wow. We've been going for an hour. I know that's crazy. I realized we we also need to do bumpers for the Megadeth we never did that. I will do that. Yeah, we have to set those set that up and close that one out so I can finish editing that one.  You want to finish this off? Yeah, I mean, how do you want to finish it? Because I'm in and I can edit this stuff that we're talking about. It's going to be gone anyway.  Well on that note God who we talked a lot. We talked a lot of stuff and I even think we're able to cover everything but now but you know, they'll be future episodes where we go deeper into promoters into you know, things like that that can give people a little more insight. I think that like like, you know, just after our conversation for the last hour. I can you know say that people are listening or probably going to get a little bit of a different perspective on you know, what it's like to be out there as long as for example, you've been up there or even someone like me as  It is I've had to be able to have all those memories and you know move into a different career in recording and still making memories. Like we can have a whole episode we should and will do one about like the behind the scenes of making records together because we've made some records together now and they're fun times and like some of the things like when my dog ate be seized beef, you know are those those things like that she gained 15 pounds of eating beef. Yeah, you know, like people people don't  Get that so our perspectives are going to develop more. We're going to get some more episodes where people will really learn. I know you and I have talked about, you know, giving people that inside scoop on perspective because I don't think people realize what it's really like. So yeah.

spotify:episode:4JVhSNnzmEQkXv5QgWW5GM	Hello and welcome to the family as far as podcast. I know Hearts Mauna Kea eggs a period in woman's life coach where I help women to harness the power of their period and connect back to that Julius Caesar palace in this episode. We'll be talking about all things periods vaginas hormones Women's Health sex confidence food femininity and all the stuff that goes through our heads. You'll walk away from each episode a few nuggets and true from as I don't seem to have a filter. I love talking about all the shit that people are too afraid to say  say but everyone is thinking  Hello everyone. Well, this is crazy. But if a change of scenery here, I'm currently sitting underneath my do not on my bed to hopefully not get any Echo for you guys because I don't have some full Pro setup system yet because I literally decided five days ago that I was going to actually bite the bullet and start a podcast. If you know me, if you follow me on Instagram, if you don't you should my handle is at Mauna Kea its health and if you've been following me for a while and you're an OG subscriber not subscribing what the fuck follow-up but like I don't even like this.  Follow up because I have something like I'm not you guys aren't shape. Anyway, whatever you will know that I've been asked for a long time. I'd say nearly about a year now to do a podcast because I like talking as you would gather. I am quite the talkative person. I am Little Miss Chatterbox. Anyway, I'm just kind of bit the bullet because I was like, you know what I'm able to reach out to a broader audience, which is amazing because my goal is just to be able to help as many women as possible and change as many lives as possible.  And also it means that you guys listen to me more on the go because I realized that YouTube videos and stuff are fat, but I love doing them and I will continue to do so, but two reasons one, you know, you can't download a YouTube video. So you have to use your 4G and like let's be real. We don't all have endless amounts of 4G. So that's like a real real problem for majority of us. I know it is for me and then Instagram live it runs out same thing. It's a video you have to sit down and watch it. You can't like pause it and shit so that also becomes a little bit annoying and  Sir, just for me like I have to look I have to look like not done up fully because I always jump on Instagram stories and I'm like looking pretty gross, but I need to look kind of presentable and not to be on camera. And if you know me, you know that sometimes I am just not the most presentable person to be around. Anyway, this is great because now it can be like 10 p.m. At night and I can be out if I go to spare of inspo I can chat to you guys just fantabulous. Anyway, I'm going to jump straight into it and not talk too much about but fuck nothing.  Oh, yeah, just a little FYI that I can guarantee that every single episode is going to have swearing in it. So if you are offended by swearing, then I'm definitely not your girl because I'm actually saying this to a new client the other day that that when you swear the moment that you swear it actually Cuts your ego out of your mind. So it actually allows you to just like Snap into the present moment for a second and that's why a lot of coaches and a lot of like, you know personal develop people actually use  Because it actually Cuts you out of the sort of cycles that your brain is in of like oh poor me poor me when someone says fucking shut up, you're like, whoa, and just for that one second. You've actually snapped yourself out of it. So that's a little behind the rate like the reasons for why I do it but also because that's just my personality. I am very very real very no bullshit a bit Cutthroat and I don't beat around the bush which you'll find your kind of do that at least episode. Anyway, the first episode that I'm doing as in the one right now that you are listening.  Ooh, I'm just doing a little intro. I'm going to tell you guys about my story for two reasons one because I want you guys to be able to sort of feel like, you know me and then you can understand the references that I talk about further on but also because apparently when you set up a podcast you need to um, you need to like have your first thing either like test it out or something or other and if you don't have your first episode and it can get like like they won't put it up. I don't know something random like that. So I was like, let's just be on the safe side dudes. Probably Monica a couple things to know about me. I often talk in third person. I often say Monica. Does this or like  Hi, Monica, like Monica you adopt and another thing is that I talk really really fast. So if you will, everyone says about me if you are countless artists and me you might need to actually slow down your settings on your podcast for me. I actually speed everybody up because I find everybody to be like a slow talker, but you might actually need to slow me down because I am quite the fast talker. However, this is going to be a great experience for me because I'm going to try and practice at talking.  A little bit slower. However, I always have a lot to say in a short amount of time. So we're probably going to like four minutes and 36 seconds or something since the intro. So, okay, let's start from the very beginning shall we will start at the very beginning. Okay, so long story short, I was born in Melbourne and then I was really really tiny like don't even remember at like fucking baby not walking yet, but screaming apparently actually mum said, I was a pretty good kid. I don't know. Anyway, we moved to New York City. So I grew up in New York.  Update and that's why you'll you know, I'm moving to New York at the end of the year. I'm going there in a couple of months to do some talks and and to La as well New York has my heart when people say why are you moving there? I it's honestly like it's a bit of an art no answer and and that's not because I don't know but my answer is I just feel so at home there. I don't really feel a hundred percent at home anywhere else. I don't really feel like I belong in any other city, but I really feel like I belong in New York and one time I was doing some like deep subconscious work and actually  I saw my youngest version of ever seen in myself. I can remember like what until I can remember like my earliest memories like five years old, but I was ice-skating on like the Frozen Creek but my that I was having some subconscious work with a coach and I remember being like really tiny like three years old standing outside this Deli in up on the upper west side mum was inside it was also covers a dog to be honest all the football the way to my own art, whatever bit random and  I was looking at my mom, but I would like as made the older version. I was looking at my little young self and she was buying like a pink dress and she had a metal I had on I used to be obsessed with Madeline anyway, and I looked at her and she said to me if you want to find me again, you need to come back here. And for a lot of us. We're always trying to connect back to our inner child because our inner child is pure joy pure happiness pure love it is so pure and it hasn't we are born Perfection. We are born without any conditioning and stuff.  And it's the stuff that we learned over time that then is what adds to the layers of the onion. So it's all about peeling back those layers to come back to the core and your core is your soul and your inner child and stuff and that oh my God, my neck is getting so sore from holding my dinner up. I'm gonna have to work out another way to do this and that's sort of another reason why it was actually just more out this happened to me last year and it was actually more like an affirmation of like right. I need to get my ass there ASAP. I already decided I was moving there beforehand, but it was kind of like a when I'm ready.  And ready often means when you were like super financially stable because you know money's a big block from those people. You know me included. I work through it every day anyway, so I'm moving to knock end of the year, whatever. So I grew up in New York lived there. So most of my first memories and everything is there and from there that I moved to Sydney Australia and then then we moved to Melbourne for a bit and that I am back in Sydney. So right now I'm in Sydney love Sydney love Melbourne but nothing.  Pairs to New York City anyway, so that's sort of like my growing up bit by sort of story in terms of like where I got how I got to where I am. I never knew that I was going to do this. If somebody said to me a new 12 Monica, you're going to teach you about their periods and talk about sex and femininity and like just do all that sort of like counseling brain stuff. I would have been like that's the weirdest thing ever and it who the fuck wants to talk about periods because I was not obsessed with periods or anything like that when I was younger, but little did I know here I am.  When I was in school and stuff what I always wanted to be was when I was little I wanted to be a pop star and then as I grew up I was going to you know be a businesswoman. I was going to do my bachelor of Commerce at Melbourne uni had gotten into like the top rmit program for fashion design. I was very very into sewing in fashion and and I still love selling and I was really talented at that butt and I thought that was my thing, you know, but actually mom said to me a couple years later ones.  Oh, I found my period stuff. She was like I dip down knew that wasn't your thing, but I obviously wasn't going to tell you that because we all need to go on our own Journey which was good of her. Anyway, so the reason what how I got to where I am. Right right right. Now was I was on my Gap here and I'd been doing my ski instructor course and we're still having an absolute ball. Like I'm ago it was the most fun thing ever. Then I moved to London and I was really bored one day and I went to I walked all the way into a shit. What's that?  Department store in London called and then it starts with s I can't remember. Anyway, I went in there and I bought Sarah Wilson's I quit sugar cookbook and my mom had like talked about her and she done the eight-week program and everything and I use have a serious addiction to fruit to the point where like my mom would ban me from grapes because I would be so violently ill from eating too many of them anyway, and she you know said to me like maybe you should like so I don't like fruit like it's too much sugar and I was like, no its natural sugar. There's no such thing.  As too much fruit. Well little did I know anyway, so I sat down and read this book literally the whole book in one day in London made a ton of notes and from that day forward quit sugar and very very rarely eat it and it will usually be some fruit As a treat like I never like on a day-to-day basis. I'll never have fruit but for special occasions, they will so that was what sort of started me and then I and then I was just got back into my cooking. I was always very healthy. So I was always a healthy girl at school.  And I was always quite health-conscious but the wrong sort of health-conscious right? I was like the low fat calorie counting kill myself. So I burn 600 calories on the cross trainer after school sort of thing. I wasn't I wasn't just I wasn't healthy in my mind body and soul. Anyway. I was like the marketing healthy. So then then yeah, I was in London. I started getting really healthy again, but actually healthy this time having lots more fats having less less rice and all those sort of  the grains that can be really disruptive to your gut anyway, and unless is quite a quite natural sugar and that was sort of what led me onto my journey and I was putting up pictures of my food on Snapchat back when Snapchat was like a thing was putting it up on there and one of my friends actually Steph. She said to me, can you just start a blog so I can stop asking you for recipes and I was like, yeah why the fuck don't I so I did and I started a Blog I traveled around Europe for a month with my  In Sydney, and I said sugar free the whole time except for a bit of gelato in Italy because it would actually be fucking rude not to do that. And that would be like just unhealthy to go to roe deer Europe go to Italy and then not eat any ice cream. Like that's the dumbest shit I've ever heard anyway, and then so then I started my blog when I got back to Melbourne for my Gap here started it and it was along really well and I just became more and more interested in my health anyway and then fast forward a little bit. I broke up with my boyfriend at the time and so I was like, oh no point being on the pill.  Anymore, so I went off the pill and this is sort of where things are a little bit downhill. I went off the pill and I was so effing skinny at the time. I didn't actually realize how skinny I was right at the time. I thought I needed to be skinny. I was still in the mindset of like losing weight getting fit are getting leaner. But I was and looking back on pictures. I was just like whole I'm hot. I'm like, holy effing shit. I was like skin and boring but the thing was it wasn't intentional. So the thing was that I was actually eating  So much food more than what I am eating a now so so so much food, but it was going in one end and straight out the other basically coming off the pill my body lost all of its hormones. So I was making no progesterone and no Easter Jen. I was making a little bit of testosterone but even still it was such a low level and when I got these test results back, I was like, holy shit like they were dangerously dangerously low, so I started working on my stress levels I'd had  I'll quite a bit of stress at the same time. Sorry. I'm just trying to get a little more comfortable. My leg is like breaking. I was started working on my stress levels. I started just trying to eat eat like a ton more fat in my food good fats, of course and carbs and that combo is what can help you pop on a little bit of weight. So I basically just put on weight right and it was I was it would took me so long. It's 18 months to get my first period back I was doing her.  It's and all that sort of stuff. But to be honest, I don't think it has helped me that much. I think it might have done a little bit of something kicks out a little bit. But honestly, I really need to fucking get my weight back on because it was insane how skinny I was and fix my brain because my HPA axis was just screaming danger danger danger to my body. So once I fix that I got my period back and that was the end of 2017. I got actually can I point in just there? I also have seen the  that men have on women Cycles in a good way and I actually really believe that my then my boyfriend that I got like second half of 2017. I actually recommend that he had such a big part to play in my hormones my first met him I didn't have my period still and and you know when I was with him, then my hormones were coming back. So I believe for obvious reasons like we're talking orgasms sex just being around men and all  Is happen others endorphins and the oxytocin and serotonin and stuff. I actually really believe that being around men plays a really really big role and I've seen it be quite a few women and for myself and just boosting your libido and stuff and if your bully libido is higher then of course, you know, nothing is nothing plays a role by itself. It's all interconnected. So I got my period back for about two cycles and then I got really horrendous Quincy. So I actually had tonsillitis. I never translators before but it was so  bad that I couldn't kill it naturally and I was unable to breathe so I had to go on antibiotics which didn't make me happy because I'd been on a ton of antibiotics before that. Oh, I have some time to start was I had actually going back to that in a second. So when I antibiotics are my for Maya tonsillitis, it didn't go away. So I then actually ended up a week later getting Quincy Quincy. If you Google it maybe don't go and images. Basically, it's like your tonsils get so inflamed that they  Just like filling with pus and it's was fucking foul. Like I can't even tell you what the grossest thing ever. And I thought it was just like the tonsillitis come back but it wasn't going away. Everybody was kind of blowing me off but it was like as in my family and friends and and boyfriend and everyone was like blowing me off and I was like literally dying. I was like something was actually wrong. Anyway, I had to go to the hospital then because I was so unable to breathe so in the hospital and they put me on steroids and all that crap and nothing worked so I came back.  Anyway, they ended up, you know being like the cat's Quincy and they had to fucking drain my tonsils. It was but fucking foul. I can't even tell you. It was like a needle in my throat and they would oh my God, I have full Goosebumps and they were draining. It was so disgusting. So the stress from that made me lose my period again. I'm very sensitive to stress. It may lose lose made me lose my period again. So I lost it again, you know, I didn't get it for a month and I thought it was going to come back, but then we all went away.  May my family for an amazing ski trip and on the second fucking skiing day. I had a really horrendous ski accident and I was then in hospital and I lost my period again as soon as it happened. I was like right there goes my period like not as like a damsel in distress moment. But like I just knew like my body is very sensitive distress and my period was just so sensitive because I just coming back anyway, so I had a really horrendous he accident and basically what happened was I was going I'm as I'm a  certified ski instructor like I know how to ski but a snowboarder actually hit me and my bindings. I think we're on too tight. So everybody please go check your bindings next time of year skiing. I think my bindings were too tight because otherwise my ski boots should have popped out. Basically it didn't and my need twisted and my ACL ripped off a chunk of my tibia, which is like my shin bone. It ripped off a chunk of that bar, which is fucking insane, but my ACL didn't rip. It just ripped off the bone like wild anyway.  Partial tear my MCL. I had a fluid pocket enamel damage and college damage. So that was a fun seven our operation and that was on Christmas Eve that happened. That was a real bummer. The pain that I was in was beyond excruciating. I can't even explain how horrendous it was. It was the pain where you do want to die. It was the pain actually it was a sort of pain where I thought from this amount of pain you would be knocked out, you know, when people are in that much pain they  That anybody knocks themselves out. Yeah, that's what I thought like I was like why hasn't anybody knock me out yet? Like that's the amount of pain. I was in it was absolutely wild anyway, so that was not fun. So I had a big operation than and I was on a ton of drugs like absolute explosive amount and that took me a really long time to recover. So I was in a wheelchair for about a month. We stay that in the ski resort whilst go was actually allowed to fly home.  My family kept skiing and I sort of tried to put up with it as best. I could it was really really emotionally challenging and mentally challenging and physically challenging and and spiritually challenging. I'm lucky that I do have strong belief that I trust in the universe and I do believe everything happens for a reason. I've seen it time and time again in my life. And I honestly, I don't know how people live not believing that everything happens for a reason because that's just a pretty like shitty approach to be having every day.  Life every time something goes wrong. You like fuck the universe like what the hell anyway, so it was really really hard but we were getting there. So I was in a wheelchair for a month and I was on crutches for another month and a half. There were they told me that I was going to be unable to wait there for three months and I kept saying the surgeon nut like I kept just being like no I'm going to be fast and I'm going to be faster than that and he was like you actually can't be like that's how long will it take to heal. But of course with the power of my brain and my really  Really healthy diet and lots of bone broth and stuff. I did heal faster. So I was off crutches about three weeks before I was meant to be which was fantastic and myrcella getting back into it. God learning how to walk was the hardest thing in my life you really if you experiences you'll understand what I'm talking about. But your brains just like just walking on a car but like you actually can't like it says it's the weirdest in that I'd put my leg down and it would just like full-on like I couldn't put weight through it like it was it's incredible. How amazing  This is why I love Brian. It's incredible how your brain operates. Anyways, I had that ski accident and then about like my fourth month in for my ski accident. I got an abscess in my in my incision. So as my scar was as my incision was healing which is like the scar on my leg. Now. I see this whole started to form basically my body rejected one of the stitches and it was creating a big fat hole in my leg, which was great. The pictures are absolutely foul.  So I'm not going to post them anywhere. But actually if you were a follower back, then you would have seen them because I did post the pictures. But basically it was like this massive hole in my leg. Like you could stick your finger in it. It was you it was you could see like my flesh it was disgusting and I tried to it wasn't infected though, which was the great thing. It wasn't actually infected. So I kept it uninfected. Is that a word uninfected? I don't know anyway, but and I didn't go on.  Through the evening of the doctor was like you have to go in anybody's house when antibiotics I was like why and they were like and I was like, is it infected and they're like, no, but and I'm like, right so I'm not going to anybody because my argument is if you're if you go in any biotics like it's just going to lower my immune system more and my means Justin's already solo from all the antibiotics. I've been on in a hospital and Other Drugs. I've been on why would I throw more of an immune suppressant into my body? It's only going to make it more likely that it gets infected anyway, so they tried we tried to just  First we tried to allow it to heal slowly naturally, but it wasn't it was just getting bigger and bigger and I wasn't getting infected. It was just getting bigger and my surgeon in America whom I love so Fe much. His name is Jeffrey or I need to give him a shout out because he's the best. He's in Lake Tahoe if any of you have a ski accident in Lake Tahoe, he is your man. He was here. He was walking and she said to me if even if you allow it to heal naturally, you're going to have more of a big scar than if  Cut it out and just and they cut it out and redo the surgery because then you'll have a line like you already do so. Basically I was like, okay, let's just do the surgery I gave in not even gave it. I wasn't giving in I just realized that if I like I was I had to keep going back to the hospital every two days to get the dressing change and I was like, I can't do this like this is ridiculous. So I got another surgery at the same time. They tore through my scar tissue in my knee.  Because my flexion and extension was really really bad and my surgeon was what bit worried about it. My American surgeon. Jeff was a bit worried about it because if you leave the scar tissue for too long without moving it then you have to get another surgery for them to like burn it or cut it out or something anyway, so they also bent my knee fully and straightened it fully in the surgery which is creepy to think about which at least tore the scar tissue. So that was my second operation and I woke up.  And had to go on crutches for a little bit more but then you know it set me back a little bit. But at least the the wound was gone and that sort of was my ski accident and then from then on ton of rehab learning how to walk again. Just getting all my strength back getting my body back lowering my cortisol. I got my period back about six months after my ski accident and I have had it ever since then which has been great. It's tough for me to hold onto. I've had one month where I was really stressed and I didn't get it but  That's sort of my journey my period and really between the first time I lost my period when I came off the pill the first time I lost it. I was just wanting to know why did I lose my period like, what is the reason here? And I was trying to figure out like what was going on with my body. So I started doing a lot of research and I was like, holy shit. There is this whole world that nobody has taught me about there is barely much education about this at school. All I really told about at school was like we get a period  It can you know, you can fall pregnant basically by looking at a boy. Like it's just so much fear place in our minds, right? And before I went on the pill, I had a horrendous periods like my pic. This is the reason why I went on the pill was because my periods was so horrendous. I couldn't deal with it. Like I would sit on the toilet and the blood would gush out of me. My periods was so heavy. I couldn't even wear tampons. I had to wear maternity pads and even then I'd have maternity pad on for 20 minutes and I have to get out of to change it again like it was horrific.  Vic right, but nobody told me o it's easier to dominance or oh, let's look at the food you're eating all the stress or all these other things in your body all let's do some natural things. It was just like let's take you on the pill and then it will lighten your period Well, it's light on my period so fucking much. I lost it like anyway and FYI lady is quickly a pointer the bleed that you get when you're on the pill is not a period anyway, so through that first year. That was what made me get really interested in periods, and I just got obsessed with it.  I was like, this is what I want to do it. This is a hundred percent when I want to do in my life and then the second time I lost my period it was again reaffirming just how much I am. So passionate about this and learning more about this and it just I just kept studying and studying and studying and understanding as much as I could about periods. And here I am now, but obviously in that time as well gone to UNI. I've studied my life coaching certificate. So I'm like ICF certified All That Jazz and here I am now teaching  She went about their periods and hormones and health and self-confidence and and sex and all that life stuff that we deal with side note. Monica actually means to advise and counselor. So that is super random, but I don't even think it's random. I think it's a absolutely perfect how that has worked out. I guess some other little side note things that you ladies might be interested in is that I think at one point I actually had a bit of a  Demetrios has I used to get such painful periods. So when I was on a gap here, I would wake up in the middle of night with like stabbing stabbing pains in my uterus. I'd have really really painful sex and I one time I was having sex and I just started screaming with pain and that was fun for him anyway, so so I know when I fix my diet and quit sugar and stuff it all went away, so I have dealt with  a bit of everything I've dealt with the bad periods dealt with the people say except with the Endo dealt with the dealt with the really really heavy periods dealt with all the surgery and the inflammation and going from really skinny to that having my curves back and how that affected my brain as well and what I was thinking about myself and my self-confidence, but honestly some of the things that I have my ski accident is a biggest blessing I have had the biggest 2018 like  So much growth and the whole process was just meaning to trust so much, hence. I now have trust tattooed on my ribs, but one of the biggest things that really I was one of the biggest lessons for 2018 for me personally was that at the time of something you're like, oh my God, this is taking forever. So for example for me to get my strength back for me to get toned again for me to you know, when I was having my ski accident  Put on a lot of cortisol. Wait, no a lot. It was just that I started getting cellulite on my stomach now in my family the girls we all naturally carry our weight in our bums and hips and we have very flat stomachs. It's easy for us to like get a toned stomach and we don't carry weight in our stomach, but for my ski accident all the cortisol is just sell my stomach and I'll explain another episode why this happens why your body stores fat around your stomach when you've got high cortisol, which is yours.  All my hopes are I was like doing hang up your stress hormone. But yeah, like I'm in a hospital right and if you look at like videos and stuff, like I've lost muscle and weight on my arms and my legs but then you can say like my stomach like it has that like it's inflamed as fuck. Anyway, that was also all the drugs are my liver working really hard. So at the time when I was trying to get my fitness back, I'm like, oh my God, why is it taking so like can't fit into like, you know, my shorts are too tight. My skirts tight Nothing fits me I  I don't feel confident in my clothes. Like I'm so puffy and inflamed and all this shit and at the time you're like when the fuck is this going to end but honestly time flies one and two like I don't know how to say it. But basically at the time that's what you think but like 2018 is gone so quickly and now I'm back to doing Pilates being able to walk, you know, I'm getting my old body back, but you know what? It's taught me so much that your confidence comes from  In its fuckin and everybody says this but this is something I'm really passionate about now was teaching women and my Approach is a little bit different. It's not stand in front of the mirror and tell yourself. I love you. It's just getting to the core of the shit. But also just being super real about it. Like the real facts were I had a horrific ski accident. I was on heavy as fuck drugs. Could anybody expect me? Expect me to be looking like a Victoria's Secret model? No, I had no circulation because I lost half of my lymphatic system. You know, I had serious nerve damage.  Age I had horrendous like, you know, emotional trauma and stuff from it as well. I lost I was losing sleep like everything was frustrating and stressful and my body was really really trying to heal. So nobody can expect me to have ripped abs and toned arms. Anyway, it was actually just my ski accent that is has really been a big as lesson in terms of self confidence and self love and I know and stuff like having a bit of a Cheesy word sometimes but it's just the  It's just the confidence within yourself and and I've never been able to you know, like stand in front of a never before my ski accident and I have been able to like Santa front of a man fully naked and be really comfortable or be like yeah, let's have sex with the lights on and be really comfortable and now since my ski accident since getting my curves back and getting my period back, it's funny how a now I'm like, oh my God, like I'm so much more confident yet. If I looked at my body this time last year. I was still I still had a little bit more weight to gain before I get my period  add back and I was no not this time last year. You did the year before like 2017 right at my skinniest. I wasn't my most confident, you know, which everybody says, but honestly I can tell you it really wasn't on our most confident because confidence comes from your brain doesn't come from like how big your thighs are and obviously I've some days better than others, but I've really learned to appreciate like the fact that I can take myself to the bathroom that I can make my own lunch, but I can walk up the stairs that I can you know, I'm not walking around.  Crutches to me being able to use my two legs is the biggest blessing that if I'm having a bad day and I'm like Oh my things I found out I'm like, yeah, but at least I have thighs that work that allow me to like do Pilates and yoga and walk and go to the beach and swim and have fun and dance and jump, you know what I mean? So that's sort of one of the lessons that I learned with with my ski accident and obviously I learned tons more lessons actually wrote a blog post on this but you know, one of the other lessons was definitely like trusting in the process.  Yes, because I've made so many amazing friends since my ski accident. I've learned a ton but also the biggest thing that I've learned and the reason one of the reasons why I have the snowflake tattoo on my wrist is that at the time I just thought my life was going to come to a halt. I was like great I can't work now. I can't do my Bender events, which is like this epic. Yoga is Yoga events that I do I can't do all of this stuff. Right and I was like fuck this, you know, and I just thought that my whole life was going to be put on hold, but I actually prove to myself that when you  Whatever you think you're not capable of. Oh my God, you are capable of more than you could ever imagine. Like I would sit at my desk and I would have my leg up it did have its ice or whatever the hell it had on it. I was running events. I was phoning people I was doing coaching calls. I was doing Instagram lies. I was holding workshops whilst I was like incapacitated. So it really really proved to me that whatever you set your mind to you can absolutely do.  Do and whatever you think that you can't do if you don't think you're capable of it. I am telling you you are capable of going through so much more pain emotional emotionally physically mentally, then you ever ever think is possible. I promise you like we as human beings are so incredibly strong it fucking blows my mind all the time. Anyway, I don't want to rant on too much and make it too much about the Monica show more. This first episode is the fun. Come on.  Shower because I just want you guys to get to know me but basically to give you a little rundown of what the podcast is going to be about. So it's going to be about I've said it in the intro but vaginas sex periods Health Food self-confidence relationships like with yourself and with others how to communicate effectively basically the stuff that I go through in life coaching and also my period coaching so a little bit of everything the podcast aren't going to be necessarily an hour longer anything or necessarily have guests in them. The point is for me to be able to talk to you guys.  And educate you more without having to be like fully presentable all the time and jumping on Instagram lives. And it means that you guys though in most most importantly it means that you guys can access me in the car when you're going for walks when you're making dinner. It's a little bit more accessible than say YouTube or Instagram lives. So, hence, I wanted to make this for you as well so that you can hear more about what I have to say and learn more from me because of what I'm here to do is to teach you all in to help you all.  So there was no strict sort of guide that I'm going off for how I'm going to run this podcast. Honestly, my intern was asking me about that last night and I was just saying I'm just going to flow with it. I'm just going to flow with that. My goal is to be releasing one a week. I think I'll figure out the day as I go along on them again into a bit of a routine, but my goal is to release one a week, but I don't want to have to make this a pushing exercise because if I'm pushing with giving information that it's going to be boring for you guys and it's boring for me and it becomes a chore and  your subconscious can tell if I'm fucking bored or it you can tell if I'm pushing and then the episodes aren't going to be as engaging for you guys and I want to be engaging so it's going to be a flow process. I'm going to be recording them when I feel inspired or when something comes to my mind. We're aiming for a podcaster week don't know how long it's just going to be I feel like summer going to be 15 minutes and some are going to be like 45 minutes because you know, we never know how long when I couldn't talk for I might jump I might bring guests on in the future. I've got a few people in mind.  A really really specialized in their field that I'm not so specialized in it wouldn't be about periods or something. It would be something about like a particular food group that I'm not a specialized in so I might bring on Experts for that. But otherwise, it's really just an opportunity for me to educate you guys and for you guys to hear more about the stuff that I teach about so that I think is pretty much it for today. Please ladies subscribe to the podcast obviously so that you can get all  The updates and whatever and I would really really really really really appreciate it. If you could leave a review so that more people can you know jump on listen to it that sort of stuff and then I can just basically teach more women because that's the goal here, but most importantly please send me anything that you want me to talk about. So if you've got a specific questions topic ideas all that, you can DM me on Instagram or you can go on go on my website and fill out my contact form, or you can send me an e-mail.

We're going to keep shit real I need to get out of this do now because I'm so fucking hot. I can't even explain it and it's actually quite miles and Sydney today. So I'm like a 35 degree day. I don't think I'm going to go to record a podcast or  If I am you make a little bit of echo in the background, sorry, not sorry.

What's going on Packer fans welcomed into another episode of the packet a podcast your daily podcast for Packers news updates and everything going on at 1265 Lombardi Avenue and titletown this is episode.  Evan Janelle Mackay, and I once again checking in Janelle what is going on? Lots of great things. We're going to start off. I know this is a football podcast, but I think we both have some hockey plugs you want to actually make absolutely that would kind of explain my raspy voice. Oh, I'm sorry about that in advance. But yeah, I'm back home in Minnesota right now because my brother his hockey team went to State and they won so  Congratulations. Congratulations to the jgb Chiefs from Centennial and yeah, shout out to my brother for that Jacob Mackey. Very proud hits a senior year so left it all out on the ice. Very proud sister. Fantastic. That's awesome. JJ B is at a high school. Yeah, it's so Junior Gold. It's like Youth Hockey Association outside of the high school. Got it. Got it. Got it high school. I Minnesota things.  Sort of hockey is just a different level. I have a friend of mine his family logo and like watch Minnesota hockey like the state championship year year after year and it's it's insane. So congratulations your brother. I saw your Snapchat looked like it was pretty yep. It was them. It was a duck double overtime and nobody. Yep. They wanted on a penalty shot. So awesome. It was very crazy. I saw a die. Nothing I've ever shaken so much on time of loss.  Yep, you Dinah loss which is also a big deal. So they played for third so they didn't have to play them in the championship, which is also a plus perfect. Yeah my speaking of hockey again my one of my friends from growing up in elementary school. He actually played for uwsp pointers. He now coaches for them and they beat st. Norbert's on Saturday night at the KB will arena in Stevens Point. Some people listening may have been there some people listening may actually know what the KB will it is, but they won three nothing versus norbert's  She played this Friday night at 7:00 or 7:30. I believe again at the KB will it create who they play but down in the Frozen four on the division three College Championship. So very cool. Shut up. Tyler career coach career. Hold it down for his alumni in his team right now, but one other thing before we get to the Packers news of the day, March Madness is upon us pack a day podcasts Captain Andy Herman set up a  A ESPN Tournament Challenge, you guys can go ahead and find it by typing and pack a day podcast there maybe a hyphen in between pack a day the search it that way. It's a free entry one entry winner gets $50 to the Packer Pro Shop Jenelle Jenelle if you were to win it, I don't know if you have an entry. What would you buy with $50 at the Packer Pro Shop go I do have an entry. I put it in today. I have Kansas winning it but  Dark Horse, I know I'm I'm a horrible bracket maker like I I don't know much about college basketball just kind of like randomly select like oh, here's going to be my upset game. But yeah, I feel like I pick Kansas a lot just because I don't I really don't have a reason behind it. But if I had 50 dollars at the Packer Pro Shop, man, I don't know I can spend like days in that place. I'd probably like a couple.  A $50 gift cards what you're saying? Yeah, I need to win this tournament a couple times actually. Yeah, I filled out so that one last night pick Duke and then I'm in the in the pack a day one. I got a couple could upsets in there. I'm pretty pretty pumped about but I'll end up filling out a couple maybe dozen two dozen by the end of before Thursday starts just cause it's like I always like to have like a paper copy of one that I feel like  And then it's like all the ESPN ones I'll do and like I won through work. I just set up for five bucks that I got some people involved in so I like the one it's cool when you set them up, especially at paper one because you can like look at everyone's entries and then the day before be like, oh, okay 90% people have Duke. I'm going to kind of pivot and go the other way and you know pick like UNC or something, but I'm not for the March hockey and basketball a lot of news today going on with our Packers.  No, why don't you start off with one of the the couple were going to get into today? Oh, man. I mean, I feel like everybody knows what I'm going to talk about. So I might as well just lay it on the table Jordan Nelson released from the Raiders. Obviously a lot of huge talk and it doesn't seem like there's a lot of gray area. There's either a lot of people who really really want him back on the Packers and a lot of people who are extremely against it. I don't really see much gray area, but I think everybody knows  Where my heart lies, I obviously want to see him come back. I think outside of the stats. There are a lot of good reasons to bring them back just because his veteran presence what he brings to the locker room and what he could do to help the younger receivers learn, but it sounds like out of the list of teams that are interested the Packers have not been listed yet. He is visiting with the Seahawks on Tuesday, which will be today the day runs listening to this podcast. I think Patriots are interested.  In Titans were one of the teams that were interested Raiders are still interested, even though they just released him. So even though everybody thinks he's an aging wide receiver. There's still a lot of interest for him. And I think the Seahawks were actually one of the teams that was interested a year ago when he was available. I think you're right John Schneider. Obviously, the gym has some Packers ties huge Jordy Nelson fan another team Janelle I saw on the list was the Chiefs and that might be just  Thrown on there very willy-nilly because of the status with Tyreke Hill which we won't get into but his career is in Jeopardy. So obviously Jordy Nelson would fit a roll there for them, but I think Seahawks are in very likely Titans getting Adam Humphries doesn't seem like they'll go out and maybe I mean maybe they'll get another receiver. I know they'd always they the titans of me always have like a bunch of beave - receivers that you never really know. It's just like four or five guys that you could just plug and play. I don't see  Them doing it Seahawks really seem like the one to me Patriots really like white receivers. So maybe they'll go get Jordy Nelson. He fits that bill. Yeah. I mean II might have to cheer for the Patriots if that happens and I will follow to the Seahawks. I have true for the Steamworks. I would have to I will follow Jordans and anywhere that's I know it hurts. That's why I was okay when he went to the Raiders, but Georgie is my guy and I will follow him and I'll support him wherever he goes. I know as long as  Out to the Vikings. That would be tough. Yeah. I already got a lot of those text messages about what if he came to the Vikings. I'm like guys don't be like that. You know, that's not going to happen. I've had nightmares about that before but  If they don't have much money to play with right now in Minneapolis, so I think they're they're gonna kind of sit on their hands and wait till the draft comes next order of business. I guess we're sticking to free agency and receivers that are no longer with the Packers would be Randall Cobb. Randall. Cobb is actually was visiting the Cowboys yesterday. So on Monday today, when a recording this is the Cowboys, they need a slot receiver.  Cole Beasley isn't there anymore after he signed his his deal to the bills?  It kind of makes sense to for you know, Dak Prescott to have a guy like Randall Cobb to be able to throw the ball to you. Got Cooper's spreading the field Michael Gallop as well, you know coming into a second year. He made some strides at late late in the year for Dallas. I could see Cobb filling a void for them. You know, they needed they did pass catchers there in Dallas outside of that. I'd really didn't see any other news where Randall Cobb was.  Interested in or teams were bringing him in for visits. Yeah. This is this is kind of like the first news that we're hearing on Randall Cobb since all the free agency stuff. It's kind of been one of those things were just patiently waiting to see what happens because similar to Jordi he's kind of a it makes sense why you would get rid of him, but he's one of those players that makes you kind of hate the business side of things for sure, so I'm getting flashbacks.  - backs the last year around this time when Jordy was released and then two days later writers snatched him up. I'm just its kind of flashbacks. It's not as I don't feel like Randall Cobb was obviously as productive as Geordi was the last two three years before he left and went to a different team. But yeah, it's like you said, it's the business kind of some of the money Randall would be looking at is I was on the spot rack, which I know Janelle you and I like is a website to check out contracts. He's looking at about just under eight million a year probably like a two year contract for about sixteen just too.  In perspective mentioned cold Beasley who had signed the Buffalo Bills going to be getting the ball thrown from Josh Allen. He signed for a four-year 29 million dollar contract playing slot receiver Adam Humphreys who had also mentioned signed with the Tennessee Titans don't know if Tannehill or Mariota whoever we throwing the ball at this point, but he signed for a four-year 36 million dollar contract and Jamison Crowder went to the Jets for a three-year 28 and a half million dollar contract. So  you're looking between you know, seven and nine million for Randall Cobb. Do I think he's worth that money? Probably not. Maybe that's why he's still unsigned Janelle and these other gentlemen already of got paid and found a new house and you know getting there getting settled in so we'll see what happens to Randy. Like I said, it's part of the business do we think Randall Cobb ends up as a packer for a cheap deal. Is that a possibility? Um, I think like it's  Hard to say kind of right now the Packers they they had their one big day and then they've been relatively quiet in house. They had what was it one one visit today? Yeah in and out pretty quickly Curtis Curtis Riley safety from the Giants and the Titans. Like I said, you know before we started recording he was just here to check out the late winter weather for the Packers and he was here and gone.  The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel tweeted out or posted that he had visited and left without signing a contract and they said more than likely he would not sign. So just to Spring off at like you said Jenelle two things one Andy Herman and episode 236 yesterday broke down the contracts of the for free agent in Smith Smith Turner and a most phenomenally some of it had to go back.  Rewinding some like wait that doesn't make sense. He's talking about front ended contracts or not front end the contract kind of the money the Packers have in play. So definitely go ahead and check that out. And then to your point Janelle just about you know free agency and what the Packers are doing, you know, they lose another another piece on the other side of the ball two of them actually, you know, they brought in Curtis Riley for a reason they wanted to take a look to see, you know, he's a physical safety able  To come up, you know play the run. I was watching a couple highlights. He had he had a real super easy pick against Mark Sanchez, which is a dump pass when March answers on the Redskins this year, so they obviously saw a reason the reason was Janelle was because like I said two guys left the other side of the ball that being controlled Bryce to the bucks for a one-year deal and ishod breelan signs to the Chiefs for a one year five million dollar deal Janelle. You can pick either one of these guys whoever you want to start.  But what is that due to the Packers secondary as we sit here middle of March. Yeah, so I guess we'll go and order things Breeland was the first one to go. We got the news of him. Yep. First this one this one kind of surprised me and honesty I I was expecting him to re-sign with the Packers. I thought that he he had he had an uphill year. He started out pretty rough. He  Don't play every game this year with the Packers but his first couple games. I was like, okay, who is this guy? Get him off the field and then all of a sudden I was like, okay, he's really getting the hang of it. Like I really like what I'm seeing from him. He's worked through his his mistakes and I thought he was really starting to figure things out and there's a lot of talk about people on Twitter a lot of people saying we want Breland back. We want him back like everybody wanted to see him back and then as quick as that happened he was gone. So I think  Especially with a team like the Chiefs picking them up. I think it shows that he did develop value in his game for sure. For sure. I think it does hurt then if at the end of Team like that if a team like that whoo damn near excuse my language beat the Patriots to go to the Super Bowl if they want a player like that then I think that shows extreme value and who the Packers developed this year.  Right. I mean they are missing some cornerback. So it's not you know, it's not get it twisted. I think Steven Nelson. Yeah to the Pittsburgh Steelers Eric Berry sitting out there who actually had a visit also with Randall Cobb then Dallas today, so they needed cornerbacks but five million dollars like  Wow, that's so you know, I saw some stuff on Twitter like maybe maybe gutti in the front office. Like hey, you know, we're going to develop Josh Jackson Josh Jones Tony Brown who I really really love Gary Alexander. We don't want to have a guy like Breeland kind of limiting the role and the the potential of these young quarterbacks. We've drafted last two three years and then to the point like, you know, breathing was productive.  With Jenelle, you know, there was some Growing Pains as you had mentioned.  They don't really need him as a veteran presence with Tremaine Williams there if he's still going to be on the team, you know, maybe we'll talk about that a little bit later here. But yes there is value with Breeland. I just wish the value of stuck with the Packers. But clearly they think you know, Tony Brown can be the fourth corner. You work your way up from that you got Josh Jackson you get Jo rugs and er Kevin King kind of fits in up in that top three spot. So you look at that core in like holy cow.  Super super young I mean, yeah and breeland's not really that old either. I think this was his fifth year. So yeah, if he's considered like the old veteran of the squad in his Fifth Season that I think that's saying something about the age of the Packers.  Absolutely, um, you know, you put that in perspective. Let's go just right down the line again, you know with kentrell Bryce I said one year deal to the Bucks. I wasn't too upset with that one, especially with getting Adrian a most last week. It's it's not that harsh of a you know, something to swallow it guess it's really not the same with Breeland, but I look at a most is like, okay, we know we're going to get from Smash. He's gonna come in and do what he does blow up.  Over the middle cover deep, maybe get a forced fumble or a pic, you know, turn over here and there but Bryce it I liked him. He's is a hard-hitting dude, you know had that ankle injury out throughout the whole year that just nagged him somewhat of a liability and coverage and tackling, you know, he likes to blow guys up but doesn't really have the form tackle to do. So, he just trying to make a huge highlight play a top-10 SportsCenter nominee.  And he owes the Bucks couldn't figure out what the contract was. But you know, does that hurt the Packers secondary at all? Do you see at this point? Um, I think it would have caught me more off guard had they not just signed a most to the squad. I think bringing him in doesn't cause issues with losing Bryce. I almost think that am I am most is like the better pick of the two so I don't think that  Bryce will be missed in the value of like talent in the defensive backfield. I think that they almost took things a step up from him. So yes, Bryce Bryce was good, but I think a most will be better.  I agree. I agree. Yeah, I mean it stinks to see Bryce go because he was a fun guy to watch. Yeah, I mean he was a hard hitter, but he also kind of there was plays where he would hit hard and it would take himself out of the play to where you look at Kim you look at me. Yeah. I mean like hitting somebody is one thing but not being able to stay in the game afterwards and then bring in smashing somebody who who also hits hard. Hence the name.  He doesn't take himself out of the game by doing so I think that's very important, especially with such an injury prone Squad that the Packers have. Yeah, that's a really good point. I mean, there's many many games where it's like second or third down and kentrell Bryce comes up here like dang you like he knocked that guy and his butt like he caught the ball or got the receiver down right away or you know guy running on the edge as a running back. He knocks him down and you're looking at him maybe on the following drive or on that.  You know that huge crucial third down after it and he's not on the field because he's getting he's in the blue tent. Yeah, that's you and you're like is he gonna play the rest of the game and it's just there's a couple of licks man. It's like holy cow. You are just you're an absolute Maniac. Yeah. He I mean it's one thing to put your body out on the line. But like we need that body out there all the time, so I'm sure for sure so I think we can both agree breeland's a little bit more significant than Bryce. Yeah. Let's transition just  Briefly Janelle look at you know, Adrian a most his contract at four-year 36 million and then trim on Williams who is set to make about 6.4 this year. He's 36 years old and trim on Williams. I don't know any turns 37  But if they if the Packers cut him before, I believe, it's June 6th or trade him or whatever. They get 3.7 million back to the cap.  Very very direct question Janelle do the Packers need to keep trim on Williams on the roster.  This is a this is a tough one because I'm trying to think of like who the veterans are back there. I think if they would have kept Burnett, then I would say Williams isn't as necessary because you have that veteran but Devon House. Like I said, I would rather get rid of Devon House. I think he's a free agent right now. So don't bring him back for that veteran presence, but I think just sometimes you just need that old guy who's been in the game a long time.  To really teach you and help you learn and understand the game because the transition like it can be hard and Williams has been in this game for a long time. He's been on the big stage. He's won it he's played with some great guys. He played with Charles Woodson. So I think he grew up with a really great Squad and I think just having that old man mentality where he doesn't always need to be on the field but more so like a player-coach  Thing for sure for sure you need you need one of those. Oh jeez in the locker room just to have a guy like yeah be like a defensive leader. Okay. Yes. Exactly. You know, I was super jacked last year. When in the preseason was the first play one of the first plays of the preseason if I think it was the first one to remind Williams gets the pick six for a touchdown in like wow, that's we're going to go trim on this year like coming back to the Packers and that was the best place all year. I mean, maybe I missed  nothing along the way, you know for a bathroom break or going to get another beer out of the fridge, but I didn't see a lot from shammond Williams and you know being 36 37 years old. That's I always have read like something's gonna break every time you hit somebody definitely I think he takes care of his body pretty I mean he has to have obviously being that age but I just you know, is it is it worth having that money? I'm just looking, you know, yeah the clanger like some freelance Breeland signs for five million and you're keeping terminal.  James you could get rid of him and save almost four million dollars and you almost were able to sign Bri that it's just you know, it's kind of a hypothetical but yeah, and it's like you think about good and okay. He got rid of Joy because he thought he was getting old and jordi's like early 30s and then you'll get will and she like, wow, he's like getting into his late 30s and he's a he's a cornerback. So you're like, where is the difference between like aged?  Like where's the lime trees? Yeah inferences injuries at majority had those knee injuries and tremaine's really never had anything significant than I can remember it wasn't, you know some soft tissue stuff here and there but but yeah, we're like you said sorry to cut you off. But again, where do you draw the line? Yeah, we draw the like what what what is the difference between like the age and the talent and like the money kind of this big triangle of stuff that you got to look at it? It's kind of like what is the deciding factor in all of it? And I mean, yeah, yeah.  Williams great veteran presence he's worked with Rogers for a long time prior to coming back. The only thing is if you bring to your mom back, please do not put him on special teams to return kickoffs. Please don't ruin any more like that's all I asked if he comes back I can't I can't watch it. And what do you like? Yeah, like in what universe is Ron Zook like hmmm? Who could I put back to Roger? Let's put the right back there to get.  I'll drive dude by all these young men like that. Well good things look is gone then but like I thankful. I couldn't keep watching that. It's like why are we putting this guy back there? Like doesn't make sense now, he's that's the only thing if you bring Williams back, I don't want to see him on special teams ever again.  No, not at all break a hip if he gets hit.  I hope not. I put out a poll on Twitter a couple days ago. I just wanted to kind of gauge after the dust settled Janelle from the for free agency editions three defense one offensive line. I just really want to see what people are thinking. I actually got about 200 votes on it. I put out. What position do you want the Packers to address and free agency still I went secondary. So cornerback / safety linebackers offensive line backer / inside linebackers.  Next one was defensive line. So d-tackle /d end and the final one was an offensive weapon running back receiver tight end. I wasn't overly surprised with the defensive line. I think there was maybe one or two votes for that looking at the percentage and I think that's fair. I mean Packers are solid across the board there. I think they have really good. Yeah, you've Daniels Wilkerson Clark like those three alone of as long as they stay healthy are pretty scary. Plus you add our new Edge rushers with the Smiths.  Like for sure and Blake Martinez who steal I have a great year, there's tons of guy Dean Lowrey might rabies atoms. So that was that one I wasn't shocked about but the next one I was surprised there wasn't a lot of Separation. The highest one was secondary with quarterback and safety a 35% in mind you this is actually before Breeland is signed to the Chiefs and Bryce is signed to the Bucs. I'm assuming if this pull it around a couple more days.  It's got maybe one maybe about 24 hours left in it. That might even creep up while after we record this next on the list is offensive weapon. So running back receiver tight ends. I said at 32% and then linebackers was this is the third most voted on at 28% Janelle out of those four that I mentioned you have one in mind as far as a position like to see your any players out there right now that you'd like to Packers to go.  Laughter, maybe we'll just not even consider money there. Anyone you're seeing or any position the packaging to address. I mean outside of my favoritism with wanting Jordi back. I still like the idea of chasing the secondary in free agency rather than draft and develop I think maybe getting like those a dressers and the oh lineman and the tight ends receivers running backs in the draft.  And then in free agency still attack the secondary because we keep getting these young guys and they it's harder for them to really get the the get the flow of the transition of college to NFL. So I think I'd rather have veteran players back there. Maybe not 36 years old like Williams, but maybe like in the 2526 age range where they've had a lot of good experience. They've learned the game somebody who's not injury-prone. There's not anyone in particular that  Mastermind but yeah, that's that's my mentality is let's stop drafting early on let's stop drafting secondary players and start attacking those guys and free agency like we did with a most because I was really happy to see that I really like the I was too. Yeah, I was I I was all about getting land and Kong or while there and then he was out before he signed with the Redskins. So I was disappointed in that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah signing it. I mean like I yeah, you're right.  You're right with were you talking about secondary guys. Now, let's flash back those, you know, four years ago five years ago where every Packer fan was slamming their fists saying hey go out and get a first-round cornerback go and get a first-round safety and they did that, you know with HaHa Clinton Dicks Kevin King Jerry, you're Alexander getting Josh Jones in the second round these guys. It's like okay, you know, we had to add that but I think we're to the point what you're saying is I think we're good. Like we don't ya and we go and dress too. You can get a start.  But I think we're at the point where it's like, okay, let's develop these few guys. Let's see if Kevin King can play a full 16 games. Let's see if Jay your legs and er doesn't have a sophomore slump. Yeah Jones a lot of that issue to bottle dude. Yeah, like I think it took a lot of years to to find that Alexander. I don't want to have to go another three drafts until we find another one. I think let's find one in free agency and that ways to Draft pick on somebody that we hope can  of up to the name. Let's find somebody who's already created a name for themselves sure and just to go off at so exact Jacobson tweeted a couple names early in the day one of our teammates on the pack a day podcast a couple names I liked on the list was Richard Michonne Melvin played cornerback. Most recently for the Raiders big long cornerback, very fast get good footwork. It's been on a lot of different teams though. I want to say is like five or six different teams all like one or two year deal.  All's I remember him with the Colts at one point too. I like him. He's decent. Mike Hilton is not a bad guy. I think they were actually teammates at one point with the Colts been a-been wicker. He's on this list Nevin Lawson Brent Grimes who I know is getting up there in age Morris Claiborne a true blue collar bump-and-run corner. I don't that really fits my patents defense, but Sam Shields is on the list yet see him on there.  Are outside of that, you know, Devon house is still free agent. They could maybe bring him back as you mentioned earlier Janelle. There's some guys in here that I don't really see.  I don't see a lot. It doesn't really seem like it would be improving on what we have it would as far as age wise, you know, if you're going to get rid of trim on Williams or even bring someone in that would step in Truman's roll and come on maybe takes a step back to that that sixth spot. I would I would say right now if I had to pick someone as Rashad Melvin, that's the guy I want the Packers go after I don't know what type of money he's looking at, but I can't imagine the market would be huge for him and I would guarantee you if you released Ramon Williams and save that three points.  Five million put it in the bank. You would probably have a little bit left over after shining signing Rashon Melvin because I doubt you're going to give them more than that and you're probably not going to give them more than a one-year deal. So I would kick the tires on him and least bring him in Spring is in two days. Let him come check out the the Green Bay Spring weather.  True very true big difference big dick sure. He brings his boat because gonna need it to get her off. Gosh. Did you did you were you affected by any of that flooding when you were in Green Bay or you gone for the couple days? Um, no definitely affected. I think that by my apartment we've developed a mini Great Lakes within pot like with potholes filled with water. So yeah, there's there's some good there's some good know what the fishing term is, but like some fish are kind of sitting  Those deep holes probably exactly I have I have a new pool. I have my fishing pole. And yeah, I have all I need right there. I can go boating. I can go jet skiing I can do whatever I want because the potholes are just so big he's got to get a boat and a jet ski exactly that yeah, that's that's what I'm missing. Right? No. I personally didn't really get affected by it. There's a couple guys that worked with that, you know had some issues getting into work.  Work I know right off 172 and Green Bay Green. I'll park I played softball are a number of years is was completely I mean flooded by about three or four feet of water. So wild if her shut it for Sean Melvin is listening Janelle and I will find you a canoe. If you do want to come to Green Bay. I think it's little, you know, subsided but in case we get more water, we'll take care of mr. Melvin. Yeah, if I do work at Cabela's I can hook you up with the kayak, so  There it is. Yeah, it is a little plug little Plum you guys come through it is there's another question. I want to bring up. So Curtis some of that listen to the podcast frequently Curtis polish in ski clearly a Polish person and is at are is handle if you will is @ks Polish. So running with that narrative his questions, you know, I'll let you answer it. I already answered it on Twitter. Just kind of reiterate what  Oh I said but he goes here's a question for you last year. The Packers tried to side sign Kyle Fuller we were unsuccessful but one of the storylines was that we made Chicago's cap situation a bit tighter by fostering their hand with the contract. Did that play out this year helping us get Adrian Deimos has that really handicapped them at all. It does seem from the outside that they have to do have little room to maneuver.  Which lead them to lose Amos. Thanks, Curtis. What are your thoughts in that Janelle? I did a little research on my own. So I'll fill you in the cracks if there's some numbers you're missing.  Yeah, try to think a little bit.  I think like I guess I can see how like a contract like that can affect another one of their players and I think it might have in a way given a most like a little bit of a kick out the door kind of opened the door for him because obviously it's a business money is always a factor in it. I think maybe we don't really know those conversations that happened between GM and player.  I'm a personal or anything like that I could see.  Yeah, it's it's really tough to save without me having the numbers right in front of me. Yeah you want on those? I don't I don't mean to put you on the spot. But Sonia good Bowlers do is like a four-year deal last year 2018. It's like six point five million dollars, which seems fairly cheap this next three years Juno 2019. He goes to 13.5 million 2020 is 17 and a half million and 2021 is 18 and a half million.  There's no way Kyle Fuller Fuller is going to get paid. You'll get paid 13 and a half million this year I would bet but what's going to happen is, you know in 2020 and 2021. He's either going to get cut if he's not playing up to you know, that money. I mean that's a lot of chunk of change for a cornerback. Yeah, he's gonna have to earn that money. He's got to earn that money and Mitchell true bisque. He's going to get paid. We know how the quarterback position gets paid in the NFL. He's gonna have to take a pay cut to help his buddy.  Number 10 on the other side of the ball and they have Cleo Mac. I don't know what his contract is like I think they I don't remember they signed him to I should have that in front of me as well bringing this up, but I don't to answer Curtis has question. I think it was a little bit of gamesmanship is what I said I said, you know, thanks for the question Curtis. Thanks for listening. I think was a little gamesmanship between Chicago and Green Bay, you know, the Packers brought him in for this they had this amount out there Chicago matches at and then added a little bit.  You know something something on top to get him to Chicago I do think also like you said Adrienne Amos was one of those players that you know, hey, you can you can walk we'll figure things out because they do have this guy by the name of Eddie Jackson Jenelle. I'm a big fan of Eddie Jackson. He broke. I believe he hurt his leg last year at the end of the season big fan of him. I think it fourth round pick from bam about two years ago. He he's a playmaker can play safety. You can play up in the  Box can kind of line up at Nickelback. He's their future starting one of their starting safeties and my mind so they kind of saw him and saw the leaps. He's made throughout his short time with the Bears in that defense and they're like, all right, a most like you can go test the market. If you come back you come back. If not, you don't and you know, it's I guess it's just it's tooth. It's a couple things it's what Travis he's going to need to get paid. He's obviously going to be coming to his third year. I would think after  Last year Janelle, he would make another big step in his skill set and you know as a leader for that football team. The other one is obviously like I said, Eddie Jackson, do you got great value out of Eddie Jackson and he's going to be there I think Cornerstone for a while and it's not like they drafted a door. I don't think they drafted a Jew named also. It doesn't really, you know, they they're able to get rid of him. So I appreciate the question Curtis great question. I know he actually listened to  The podcast I think two weeks ago Janelle and actually commented on it. I'm on the post that you guys will actually probably clicked on to listen to podcast today. So the final two things, you know, unless you have something you want to throw in real quickly. The first one though is Clay Matthews, Juno Randall. Cobb is getting rumored Jordy Nelson's getting rumored.  Any idea you think we're Randall Cobb will go there. Excuse me. Any idea where you think Clay Matthews number 52 will go at this point. I have not heard a single thing about Matthews. I haven't heard anything. No rumors. Nothing. Like the only thing I'm hearing is the same question. You're asking like what's going on with Clay Matthews and I actually did on my post about Georgie and how he was kind of the player that made me love football. I had a handful people say like that's what Clay Matthews is.  Me so I know that there's a lot of people that are really hoping he stays just because of the Love of the Game like that. He brought to them brought to the fans but sure like not a lot of interest. I'm not I'm not hearing anything from other teams any sources nothing from the Packers know rumors nothing. I'm not hearing a single thing and it makes me nervous when it's quiet like that.  Yeah, the only small tidbit I saw was maybe the Rams. I know Mark Barons gone. Maybe they need someone to play outside and inside linebacker Mark bearing obviously being inside backer. We'll see what happens with that. Maybe he comes back adds depth so that outside edge that would be quite the tandem with Smith Smith Matthews factorial and yeah ever else you Matthews for all that doesn't have like the worst numbers. I think he's definitely better when the man on the other side is healthy when him and Perry  both healthy, they were doing really well, but then when injuries affect one of them then the other kind of Falls, so I think if you bring Matthews back for for cheap, and as long as whoever is on the other side of him is applying good pressure because the thing is like one or they have to cover one of the other like they focus more on one side and then the other kind of breaks free a little bit more and that was the thing with Matthews and Perry is they put a little bit more side on Matthews and then  Mayor would get through or vice versa. So I think a lot of it just had to do with the health and who was on the other side of him and if that person was drawing any pressure to kind of open up a window for him. Yeah. I totally agree with that. That's that's well said last thing. Well, I guess there's three things. I got to get to marcedes Lewis Juno we wouldn't be a Packers news Outlet if we didn't discuss at least a signing for the package.  Re-signing the 35 year old tight end signs a one-year one point zero five million dollar contract with the Packers re signs. I guess with them officially signed today. I know he was kind of rumored to have signing last week kind of solidifying that blocking tight end that Matt LaFleur needs in his offense every scene over his tenure in the NFL's offensive mind. We didn't see a lot of plays from Mercedes loose last year that  We're you know high impact there was a few of them sprinkled in there member and you know a catch here. There may be a to get a deep 40-yard bomb from Rogers at one point in the year. But yeah, bring him back you really didn't do much with them like numbers-wise you look at it and you're like, okay, he had three receptions for 39 yards. Like they really want to bring that guy back. Like if you just look at the numbers you kind of question it but I think like  Rogers as a tight end guy too aside from Geordie some of his favorite targets have been tight ends. So with Louis and Graham and again, they need a blocker down the field without Jordy. They didn't have much of that last year having someone like Randall Cobb who was 510 trying to block down. The field doesn't work as well. You get marcedes Lewis who's six six and 260.  He can be just a big body down the field as well. As a big person was a big Target. I mean, he's 13 years. No, you didn't 13 years in the league, but he knows what he's doing. No, Robert Todd. No Robert Tanya. Love Andy. Herman has been not happy with you. Right? I do not have a single problem with Robert onion. He caught the bomb against the Seahawks. So I mean, yeah, he's been on my radar since he hit that that home run in the charity softball game. That's where he got on.  Radar, but yeah, he's somebody that's going to have to develop into a roll marcedes Lewis in 13 Seasons. I think he kind of knows his place in this league the Packers obviously have something in mind for him. So I think yeah just having that big physical presence down the field that can help someone like atoms get a couple extra yards to a first down. Those are I love the downfield blocking. I'm all about it. Like that's something I really enjoyed. Yeah, that's something I really love to focus on. I love the  players who can beat the ball Runner down the field to put a big block on someone to get them the extra yards. It's just that extra work ethic that I really like. So I hope marcedes Lewis in his contract. I hope he can do that in this next season for the Packers.  For sure for sure anything else you need to throw in today Janelle as we're recording the 237th consecutive pack a day podcast. Not really. I mean a couple days ago. If you asked me what we're going to talk about I had no idea and then today was a really busy day. So I think I think we have everything different back and oh, yeah, it's a great Monday going into Tuesday when this episode will be up. So all of a sudden a really busy week and I guess hopefully a lot more is happening this week. Hopefully we  You're more about those players were kind of on the fence about and we haven't really heard much about like Cobb and Matthew was kind of hear what happens with them. But other than that, I think we covered all the bases. I think we're good. I think we're set still looking for any packaged a podcast listeners or members to play me in some mad on Xbox how really brushing up my skills. So that's that like weird time of the year. I can't get outside and you know play softball or bike or maybe it's just like it. You know, I'm going to  Take a 45 minutes to do this. But anyone that wants to play a plan Xbox, I'll accept any game invites final question for you Janelle your 512 upset in your bracket. Do you have one that you're riding or dying with my 512? Oh, man. I honestly couldn't even tell you like who I picked on give me the matchups. I'll give you the matchups if you need. All right Marquette Murray State.  Mississippi state liberty. Those are the two. I kind of like the final two on the right side of the bracket. Let me scroll all the way over here. I don't have a paper one in front of me and I still don't have a paper one in front of me. First off. I like Murray State Over Marquette the other five until that's that's Badgers and Oregon. That's one of my teachers in Oregon. Yeah, I like Oregon as well and then AA burden New Mexico State. I love Auburn's I just like what Lauren's doing. I don't like New Mexico state so  The other three I can see go either way any of those three that you you see, let's see in my bracket. I have that pulled up. I didn't pick any of the upsets in that wall. I know yeah II just cuz I wanted to pick the Murray State Over Marquette, but I feel like I have to support Marquette and need to so I was like, okay, I'm gonna pick Marquette and of course, I'm going to pick the Badgers to make it past the first round.  Auburn for some reason it was hard for me to pick New Mexico State over Auburn. So I think my closest one I agree would have to be Liberty over Mississippi State Don't Let the Flames. Yeah. Okay, that's going to be my my sleeper team right there.  Demetrius more end everyone will know who that is by the end of the tournament. He's a dynamic guard that plays for Murray State. I imagine him and Marcus Howard are going to have a pretty fun game this week going head-to-head against each other in that 512 matchup Janelle. This was episode 237 as I said episode 238 because we go in sequential order will be tomorrow with Nick Maggie and Paul.  Great Trifecta between them Nick as I always say is the outro intro Don before we get to one of his fantastic outros Janelle working all of the pack a day pod cast members and listeners find content from Janelle Mackey. Yep, you can find content for me personally at Big Mac underscore for I did just recently put out an article for packed to the Future.  About the for signings which fun fact when I was researching for that. I found out that Billy Turner grew up about 10 to 15 minutes away from me. He went to Mountain View High School. He grew up in Shore View, which is basically the town over from me. So that's pretty cool that good ol Minnesota connection of probably crossed paths him at one point or at least my sister most likely would have she graduated more round his time. So kind of crazy to think  Out. Yeah, so I got that article out. You can go check it out. It's my first time really your nice vertical. Yeah. It was my first time kind of analyzing players that I've never really watched before so.  Awesome. Great. You can find me on Twitter at Matt underscore. F are a underscore always always really ready to Banter any pack Packer news, and I will definitely reply with a good GIF or GIF way you pronounce it. Finally Janelle before like I said before we get to one of Nick's Schmidt's Dynamic out Rose. What are the three words we end every pack a day.  So it with go pack go one kick away from the NFC championship game from the 41 left a scar.  	On today's episode, Jenelle Mackay and Evan discuss the Packers' upcoming game against the Detroit Lions.

I have to say this out loud, but I keep asking if one this year. So my special talent would be that anything. Anyone says I can find a song with those lyrics in it. Yeah, what would your special talent be?  My special talent is that I can say Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers. I pick up your copy of Ibiza by predict. If Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers. Where's the peck of pickled Pig?   But because I know that they're about to call but your hands behind your map behind your back like, you know, you'll be in a nice restaurant. I like your be interesting and there's something been tied up which I haven't been so which is your hands go then when you don't use them on my thighs because I like playing with my tits. Yeah. No not there's no no you oh, yeah. Yeah.  How many more?  We don't ever come here and be like, oh, we are this and we rate we're an educational podcast and we got animals know that I know we don't know that for a fact or information I do now because you know, when you play heads-up if you played it with the animal category, wow, we've paid it together and it gets hard that gets hard time. Yeah. Do you not know animals ya know how you're going to teach you things that you don't know? Yeah all the time. I had a conversation with cuddly and she's asking me questions that I couldn't answer and I was actually getting angry she asked me and I know this is so  simple and maybe I'm being myself out because wow she was like, so how does rain get into clouds? That's a legit question. I mean, that feels isn't geography GCS. Yeah, it doesn't okay, but then if the rain comes down where does it go after on the Plaza it dries up and it goes  Yeah, she don't know honestly, she also needs some work. Yeah, it goes down the holes and it goes down the drain and sucked up into the grass. And then that's what sunglass to grow except around and we move again because then she started asking me then how does thunder and see how technology so little time my kids?  Kids are you know studying them kind of hard subjects. There will be a way in which they can find out the max out me what those big high of 62 exactly have to do something. I can't even read it in the crate the creative stuff. Oh, I love the creative but then the officer suffered. What is your best subject in school? Art? Oh, he's Joe. Yeah, so you fucking kind of gone a star. Shut the fuck up in GCSE.  In a level art what a little more weight ratios you a level is not just about like drawing that you actually have I don't know. He's I don't know any of that stuff anymore. But yeah, I got I did very very well in our I was actually really good job to pursue being an idea. I had an amazing art teacher called.  And I remember one time she was like, she said me and a couple of other people. She's like, I'm really disappointed. You guys aren't taking doing art and University so long. Yeah, like actual pain. Yeah with like all sorts of pencil.  Bye-bye pen all kinds of things. I don't know how good I am now because I haven't done it for so long. But when I was a kid, I was always drawing I was always creating stuff always painting always like doing things like that but haven't done it in so long, but I probably can still draw something really well. But yeah, that is one skill was just like I used to be like when I was in school like I would  Like my work would be good. But then what I would do is I would do like a sick piece of art to go with it. And then that would usually bump my grade up and I right. Yes. I write something and then I do like a really good illustration. And then that would always bump up my grade or they'd be like, I don't know what you put in so much extra effort blah blah blah. But yeah, I can draw I wish I still had my artwork my a level.  I know I can't remember what I did for my final artwork. I think it was actually a portrait of something and yeah, I did really really well. Oh that's yeah when I was a kid, I wanted to be a fashion designer.   Mm. I love me. Yeah English and then I got to a level English and I love English was Next Level Next Level when I got a días I saw you walking is all of the natural to me never works hard in English, like ever whatever you hang it out. Look at the tears. I cried. That's the first time I failed at something I got you in Psychology. I have never in my life told anything in education.  You unclassified dance? Yeah, because basically we had to do like this choreography. And the thing is they didn't tell me that we would have to perform the choreography again. So I freestyled it in it because I thought they're not gonna know. Yeah, but then when it came to doing it again, and I remember I dance to the instrumental of Mariah Carey All I Want For Christmas Is You that is  She was like, okay cool Misfit and she's a fucking bitch, but she's like, okay do it again. Now. That's the thing that I should say again if you free start that yeah exactly, but I actually didn't think I'm just gonna be Bobby just you dance on that Performing Arts Performing Arts. I did know just dance I like we did drama as well to be fair. But I mean as a whole I took dancers GCS. I didn't take the gym Vicki Performing Arts music and English for  Me I really really enjoyed especially when we were doing poetry because to me it was like songwriting. I loved it so fucking much and yeah, I had an imagination boy my music teacher was lip while you people but she's the biggest she's the biggest I started could and began.  No being the best songs baby boy. How did that go? Hey my love for you. Oh, it makes me feel and that's what their biggest. Yeah. The first one was a bang on the video was them in like the circus. I remember going to that get this is big. Well, yeah banged Jamelia where she's not mine.   Any videos from the last decade that really stands out to me Beyonce's all like her video album. That was amazing. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, we cared about even that directs and teaching these song the video. So yeah that looks I really likes that what makes me was the small details for example, like when they were like working or whatever the screen was cracked and I was like that is such a symbol of my like quite working. Yeah your work your  Not fixing that. They're actually fully together. You know, what did he think and and everyone's like and everyone's like are toxic goes to know why? Yeah, I would pay to look like her. She's like she's actually pile of myself. I love how I look but if there was one perfectly, yeah we could change.  To look like actually between three people know for maybe five will be T cos content because I think she's oh yeah - yeah Louis Harvey Teyana Taylor. Oh, yeah, Teyana Taylor is ridiculous because she is wow and Kelly Rowland. Yeah, and it may be a teen chick Gabrielle Union factors look like almond butter mixture. No, I would have I would have Draya's body Jo I would just have Draya's body with Lori's face, and I think I'd be content.  And then Gabriel o or tikkas complexion and then I think I'll be perfect. Wow, I'd be the perfect person. I like break up with her. Yep.  Is it real? Yeah. Yeah, because you would is she must wait, she's older than their waists. Yeah. It's because the way where she was when she took the picture of like facing us you can see that dip is not natural. There's no way. Yeah. I think she's had some but we haven't really faced. Yeah, I think it's a bit of editing and I think she has had a bit of a nip and Tuck but she still banging on the left - she looks amazing actually. No, I'm not.  Say that what you're gonna say so long as you don't touch your face. Nah. Nah, but yeah, then again, I don't agree. I wholeheartedly don't agree with Sergio. Yeah, which is why I see your face. Yeah.  It looks like it was a dentist. No. No, I saw his makes over me because I was when I told you about something I'm gonna I would like if it's the skin lightening. I'm gonna be really pissed. Oh, yeah. That was the one thing. That was that that's good. That's the one thing that's gonna piss me off. Ugh. Yes last year sometime that is so I mean not that people weren't still do it, but at least the government of steps in to intervene and I mean,  I don't think we're there yet. Not a lot of places are not there yet. So they've sucked like selling the products. He/she can always find these black bars are not allowed because I'm not allowed here. Yes that is illegal, but they don't care enough to strip it from the shops and stuff here but isn't and you know, why guess what? Guess what guess what do you think?   I've been trying it does mean you're not racist. Oh my God. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes abso-fuckin'-lutely this country but one I waked him so much we knew he was different though. What's amazing about how he is we've seen his growth. Yeah this man used to dress in Nazi outfit. So this man was was not okay. No,  No, and it's Matt likes. I saw a headline. He was like how is going from the life of the party to a woke up like sorry. What-what is that he's just not the outfit literally so that's a lot of the buyers that we have in the laughter. Yeah, none, whatever above everything about him is that he picked his wife. He puts his family. Absolutely exaggerate how much people like, oh my God. I can't believe you picked his wife over his fucking man his none. Yes, I fucking man. Are you mine? That's fucking disgusting. She chose this life. I just think you know what? I was mad. I was watching.  Take heed that I saw on Twitter and there was a clip from LBC and it was James O'Brien and he's like, he's a white guy that's like quote unquote. Woke like he's really smart. I saw someone who didn't and they were like, oh, you know, you know, when these people call in to these radio stations off and they say things of such vim and conditions, you know, they literally that's what this guy we only saw the weirdos here. So we're like a outfit and Union Jack has to so bad bad fucking weirdos where it is called up and he's like, oh well, you know at the end of the day, we just think that Megan's changed her.  Hurry complain. What is that? And he was like, well I ever met him and he was like I was like, but you seem to know about his change in personality. So when was it that you first met him and when was the last time you met him to be able to make these comparisons and the guy was like no, I'm not saying that I'm saying that I've been following him all of this time. And then he was like, well, I hope not because yeah, and then he was just like he was at so where's the evidence that because he kept on saying no making changed him and make him controlling. So then he was like, where is the evidence that she's controlling?  What receipts you have basically, but I could not answer at all that he could not answer when she embarrassed him for it was actually so embarrassing and it just goes to show that how people's biases work because people don't realize that they're being racist just because they haven't called her that anyway the fact that you don't like her for absolutely no reason whatsoever. You can't come up with a legitimate reason you've got no receipts as to what this woman has done and yours is just based on a feeling that's what everyone said. I was just a feeling. I just get a feeling that  she's like this like a Taffy take you don't know shit. She uh, she's ho for the fame. So if one mad exactly she had fun she likes and she comes from money as well. And let's be honest. Yeah, if it was Kate and William that I liked, you know, what we need to step down. We need a break. We just need like that. We just need a second to get everything in order. You know, the headlines would be por que Les be like, let's give her some sympathy but because it's Meghan because there's been things that  Kate has done that Megan has done this same exact thing and the headlines have been completely contrast. I remember the first time I saw people going I was going to do that why she keep holding her belly? Yeah. Oh, yeah that one. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah as Kate Middleton tenderly hold approaching bump and then it was something else about how she's absolutely don't think they try to blame her for the for that  Optional she was wearing a Megan was wearing off the shoulder one-shoulder dress and they were like, she's not following protocol yet. Kate is up there doing what not but for her shoulders, so what gets me nice ignore the allegations of personal injury and having a friend.  You know that one but it just annoys me when people because when these people make these comments and you ask them and they can't actually give you a reason why and how they can't correlate that with it's just your Spaces by themselves to be that o is that there hasn't clicked on to them. What is that? That's why you literally that's the reason why she's got like a black man. She treat her dad so badly. How did that happen?  They're the ones they've been doing all kinds of madness has her mum has been completely silent. Her mom has been a lady and she's been classified this whole thing her white side of the family the ones that are moving mad, but they managed to find justifications for their behavior. Of course, like they're like, oh, how could you leave your crippled sister by her crippled sister was going to go on Big Brother and also believe it's that Celestine effect.  I'm new your no. Yeah, you are very much. That's a couple of hours her dad literally sold. So she wrote him a letter and you know, you mean business when you hand write a letter. Wow, so making yes American hand write a letter that I published it. He paid for it to be published and it's like I'm fishing it was not even an opener and I was like, wow, like wow actually feel so bad for her, but no. Yeah, and obviously this is like die down hopefully by smudging that the relief that she must feel to but gee  I think so just to play Devil's Advocate. They do you think that obviously there's a hundred percent is racialized that there's no two ways about it. You can't deny it but do you think that on some levels like she would have known what she was signing up for tonight? I mean like I don't think we're your family because Dianna got a bad lie bad bad bad like some might even say it's worse like I never left.  Sign up for something that they should kind of have a responsibility not every possibility but you you know what? You sound. Like I said I Got It Bad Dinah was also in an era where like Paparazzi was insane never ever people's bins like a different time or whatever and I think I would do if I was Megan. I wouldn't have compared it to die. Neither competitor Kate. Yes seem that bad some things and people mocked her because her mom is  Who says she's not like Royal of course, that's yeah, but like it hasn't been awful for yeah, I don't think I would have thought and also because I have is not meant to be king. Yeah. Yeah, so you people think it's a child every yeah, like in my mind. I do like question the process of it because I start thinking okay. Yes. She she signed up to this like, but she didn't know what was  Um intended for heard, you know, I mean in terms of like she didn't know exactly what was expected in terms of like down to the color of her nail varnish. Oh not being able to wear tights and stuff like that or having to wear tights. Sorry, so I don't think she actually knew I don't know if there was like a rule book of okay, you're getting yourself into this and these are all of the rules and the you have to follow the protocols but more likely than not I feel that should have known those will books. Yeah. She wouldn't have expected was how the media hates her. Yeah, but just  Imagine if we could have some things. Yeah that thing hits. Why should I care? What people think fuck people? Yeah, of course that thing is like what is this imagine that on a national scale that newspapers every other weekend. Someone's got some shit to say about and it's 24/7 now because it's not even like before I always say that before it was nice.  This is my card the next day. It's kind of old news. Now. It's consistent because you've got social media is just essentially everywhere that I can't even imagine will not leave here. I never really thought he was that kind of person who always makes the nice man. Yeah - come out of nowhere and you come out of nowhere again like again, I don't like that.   Even her late 80s. Yeah, she's I think she's in her 90s. I know the queen mum live long. Yeah, we talked about how a long yeah. Yeah, definitely. But yeah, the way Megan's being treated like I when they announced that they were standing down or whatever. I was thinking our shit. She should think it was enough. She's 94 years old shot. She's 94 years old and she what she said.  He killed my mom.  Like it's not legit than I don't know what it is. But I really I really recommend then that dead that the ex Chef or something that Mike said listen snakes snakes from come out all sorts of that Corners. No just   I believe they did. I don't believe the people you don't believe ya because from what I've heard they just they just went straight to the I thought it was weird that they made the announcement at Instagram. Like I know it's 2019 and stuff, but it doesn't seem quite and I know I I think I think a bit insane to me that that would be the case. Yeah. I think she does don't trust the news anymore. Yeah.  Take the time to read the article and they don't actually know is that the this didn't happen then like that or straight when - to Australia fires were happening and then that video of it raining and Australia was going viral again. People were like no this happened back in November. This isn't now so everybody saying, oh we can all relax now like thanks to Mother Nature know these this shit is still  It is not it is so weird that she can't understand. He's alive. Yeah, like how you went like even all these stupid guy gossip size when it started lying about me. I said, oh, okay. I bet ya about yourself. The truth will never be as popular as ever ever never. It's not sweet.  It's never on there.  He's on it's quite good. That's yeah, that's and it's just true. It's not even let me the whole night warp. Love God like the other day right actually like I woke up from sleep other day what Spirit he prayed against what he does that good luck. I cannot and even that what's been shut up. He's died. How many people never be necessary? No one knows now. I know I was here.  He's actually mad at the fact that you just called him as a joke. Like I just cannot take it. Seriously the fact that a Apprentice man that orange Apprentice man is the leader of the Free World to me is actually sort of joke. Like I don't take it serious the fact that he tweets what he his world plans. He actually sweet and I'm him a hundred percent of him.  His own account. He's insane. He actually tweets the leader of the Free World tweets to let us know what's happening and he'll be like yeah, Iran thought you were funny doing that. We're coming for you. Well, the president laughter between two schools and eventually like this is actually insane like the whole world is mad. He's a very good man. It's the whole world is actually everything. You can't trust the news anymore years these papers. Like I used to always buy newspapers back in the day. I die.  Like ways and I used to read them and like I don't know if it's cause it was a different time where maybe they were speaking the truth. I think it's like used to be like a legitimate source of news. Do you wanna know sighs when I say things like a close was that closed-source a close Source here who needs the name, please?  Just make something about this point. I can't even trust my dad and then I'll keep it. Well just the one today just there one mentality is really I think I tend to quote unquote trust until someone Miss. Yeah, I think that's the only way to live, you know, but otherwise you'll drive yourself nuts. But what I was going to say is kind of built up with everything. Yeah, but that's why sometimes I get annoyed that my mom because she's just like no they hate because my mom is just like oh, you know blah blah blah like  You can't trust this person and don't tell this place in your business. And I'm just like Mom I said Mommy I can't live my life like that. I said, I'm over us how you lived where you internalized everything, but me I need to talk to us like how I deal with things and until people give me a reason not to trust him. I know that the people that I've chosen to be in my life. I trust him in it. So my mom said, yeah, I'm not saying that but but I know you are but anyway just to go back to what I was going to say just to go back to Megan and hurry. Do you think yeah, just making hairy mole taking the Royal aspect out of here. Like there was another point that  Much do you think that you should live your life for your family? Because there are some people that honestly think that he was born into this life. Like it's a privilege to know. I mean like how dare you kind of just like for your privilege away not for necessarily For Love or for your family, but like like to a certain extent that you should kind of consider your family as well at how how important is it that you bring your family along or like make decisions for yourself. Oh, I'd hope my family would understand my reasons for stepping back and would  and why I'm actually doing this because he's ungrateful. Anyway, I'm just playing Devil's Advocate. That's what people said I had to do for ya. I don't think that he is going for at all. Yeah. No, no. No, I don't think that because it is this it's his wife's mental health was his family is the woman that he loves and it's his son's future as well. And I don't think he should let that suffer because he wants to show people that he's grateful for this opportunity. But something that he isn't Royal is like, okay, but  I'm not saying that I agree to satiate give it a shot. I really really like I really really respect him for what he's doing but I'm just saying at the same time like your that is a lot to sacrifice for love. There is not a single part of me that believes I should live my life on my family. Yeah, there's not like I get it and the thing is settled. That's a lie. That is a fucking lie. Let me tell you why that's a lie. There are many.  Things I don't do in my life because I'm a black man cheering woman. Hmm anything. Yeah, like as into the point of that if I wasn't black or Nigerian or raised in a family that was raised in yeah, I would someone know know that ultimately I don't I won't need to be like it was when I went the child has had their child would have had probably had about a lot more unconventional relationship. Yeah.  In quite and quite like oh, yeah, like it's open all day. So what are you saying that you that you date? We haven't done certain things because you're thinking okay. This is how I was thinking is it's so ingrained in the and thinking it's just a flat. It's just it's so ingrained in me that it's not even a possibility. My mind isn't even answer your phone. Yeah, you know what made you lose something? That's so far from your world. Like I wouldn't now wake up say  I just got to get to work today. That's no been a thought for you kids watch it. Yeah, like that's never been in my approval on my further or anything. So I say that but then I don't believe so I should live my life but it's hard because I think that's explain it well because it when you everything you're saying if you break it down ultimately goes back to family. There's a lot of things I don't do because I'm black religious and Nigerian. Yeah, which goes back to family because ultimately your family people up for you up to  Yeah, I know things, you know, I mean and then obviously like you started thinking like like there is going to be a reflection of them as well. Do you not think that like let's say if you made a decision, yeah, does it any kind of is like that then there's little things that yeah. Yeah. I think I am like that as well to a certain extent but you know how I always talk about like happiness being the bad girl, whatever like now, I think that I don't have that anymore. Like now this is not the bag.  Ugh, no, no, no that stays like no like I'm going to do what the fuck I want to do. You know, I mean, like what if I decided I wanted to get a divorce. Yeah, I would be like the old me would be like no because my parents put all this money into your wedding and my parents will be so disappointed in me and my parents my brother and my family but now just let you know if I want a fucking kids. Of course, I'm going to get divorced if God forbid I but I'm just I mean and now I'm just  Now if I want to do that, I'm going to do it thinks that that and more like it now so like if I'm like before they're sent things like how do you that yeah blah, you know, my mom's going to people come support my mom. Yeah, whatever whatever and that's also a thing for me majorly because my mom was a single parent with three girls. Yeah. We were also adamant on that. We were in my mum's literal reflection. Yeah anything we did that was fucked up reflected up. My mom was a bad man. Yeah, my mom brought us up like that. She saw this without don't shame me. Yeah that there was a consistent like  Please don't like there was a saying this in your bar. I'm not saying I don't know what it means but it basically means that Like Em cover my shame. Mmm. So even the things that go mad at home or whatever don't go out in the world and start moving married as well that you don't mean like like that's a shiatsu. Is she with me like don't expose us. Yeah. Yeah, where was going on don't expose. Yeah. It's like I was definitely blow up with that in this kind of like my mom's house and I don't want us to end up with a word.  And then people will almost shit my oh she had a husband is from the happened to her. You always do blame the mom. Now what just like good kids belong to the dad and back along to the mum when the kid is done by is the way it is so but now I have got some point of life. I'm not going to be mad. I'm not going to shame you but I'm gonna do what makes me happy. Mmm, honey. Exactly. I think there's a difference. I mean not doing something because you don't want to let someone down and doing and doing what makes you happy. Yeah, I mean because just because  my version of happiness doesn't fit with what your idea is for me doesn't mean I shouldn't do it but it doesn't mean it's a shameful thing in a respectful way as well. It doesn't have to be like, oh here fuck you. This is what I'm doing. It's just like Mom like I understand that this is what you'd want for me, but I'm happier like this and I really feel like I had hope that when Kathie Lee has older and she comes to me with something that I don't necessarily agree with or something that I haven't like instilled into her.  I hope that I wouldn't be that Mom where I'm just like really really really upset about it. I think you would because I think that the way we are living now is different to how are ya and I think that with the way our parents raised us like, you know, you take the meat and you throw away the bones in it that you keep the good stuff and you get disregard for their stuff and I think ultimately because we we live in a time now where we were so aware that happiness is the bag and whatever that looks like for you you've got to get I think that would be reflected in how you reacted. But it  to get it depends on what it depends on what it is.  Chuckles but I can't live my life for you my people no. Yeah, that's not it means how much we don't know exactly and that's just what we did, you know, there are questions that you want to ask but you don't want to ask because I don't question you mind your business and you no matter what   I could win a Nobel Prize and I'm not so day my boy said clap for yourself. Yeah, cause she doesn't end of that she does. Yes. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, it's always that you've used to hold the door. Yeah, even my auntie to ask me. So when you going up next factor for her that is that everyone's goals. Yeah. That is it. You're on TV. Do you know why I am?  Like normal people. I read those did the reunions because that was recent. That was X Factor. That was so excited to hear think it will I don't know complaints.  I've been to that is again was sent as he came in and he also was a boy band called they're trying to oh, yeah, it was when he used to these men are like thugs out that content and it's like then do singing battle Yeah. I love your battles that so what happened to that man a cigar he did his umbrella and Bentley funds. I know. Yeah funds a bitch.  That's his real name.  Like what it's like you have yet like yeah, I'd like for example at the girls from Danity Kane that on. Yeah, well people from random way panting a shows and girl band of their to known to work, but they're not making money.   And I wonder if there's so many I don't think that they're still married though the glasses yeah classic white man marries a cheeky gum out of music was what the fuck is cheeky Chief Langley that was shit actually went.

They never had a dream come true love is   We'll pick your name Chicago. I should know but love never knew what to thank God. No, I don't think they know what they do.

He was recently on like the shade room, but he said going on people who was he would have caught him be upset obviously. Yeah, and yeah imagine it bad. Yeah, he was  if he comes with 2 to the 3 to the forge, and if I offended thee  Out and cast it from the faces of profit for the that one of thy members should perish so basically like I don't think God meant it you okay? Yeah. Yeah. I feel like I've already as if you're in a circle and someone in your circle is allowing you to move mad take yourself out because you're better off taking that person out than the members getting bigger, but it's glitchy easier. That's why I just another are a lot of artists I do you think about that? I'm just like, yeah, I wonder what  You doing I'm gonna put them for Instagram.

He meet Anna you guys went nice these two presenters that because obviously that is a Nickelodeon convenient and Yolanda and they were on Nickelodeon back in the day, but that was probably you guys wouldn't know them. No shame in the real world as well the real world. Yeah, that was like the first and then actually be shy I never watch it. I just remember seeing on MTV all the time. Yeah. It's gonna Buckle Orange County was the one I see I yeah just watch the hills the hills of the like that show.  I don't think anyone watched it when they brought it back. Yeah, and I'm right-handed up on YouTube that other day looking at like little clips of like the first series of Talia the first series of Made in Chelsea excited. She did this year Made in Chelsea watch out and watching Posh people argue is the funniest I when I watched it when I re-watched it back recent. I was like, I can't actually believe he's the famous entertaining. Yeah. Well, maybe I'm so shit never watch. I never got into it. No, but your waist and love it and I kept coming back to the video.  A of Jammer and Charlie when Charlie was the dance and then Gemma was human. She looks like believe it Bobby. I can't believe that he's doing this like the first scene where she was like a car Kyle cast Kiowa Car Sales woman. Yeah. She's like, yeah, you're right get you like this car. But yeah, that's for sure.  What they've done with their money and fucking hours, you know what you can call Essex people dim all you want but they're fucking smart all of them. They take their house. One of them is going into property. They own houses. I think--for McCann's house is worth something that 1.2 million pounds all of them like Billy obviously billion Sam. I've done really well Mark critz done. Really? Well Joey Essex has like a mask. Like all of their houses are Elite like I get up and I was like why like that's a smart way to turn reality money into yeah what this is  Wish I was going to say I don't think I would you know, now I would do something more like how we or something like that. I wouldn't do something where it's like.  Like a company like June, I mean like big brother or something where it's like they're testing your strength. Like I want to be tested. I would have went out with my husband want to get my hair and makeup done on the beach and it was that time. I do not stay there and I remember when I didn't have to make them eat way things yet opened the thing and it was shaky really  I would like to me I would have banned the shocking. Why would people that's nice. So why lie the only thing because I would I want to change myself to make sure I stayed because I want and also I want to lose weight, but all I wouldn't I wouldn't want to do any of that.  Like the water challenges or like, you know, when you have to be in like it's the wind say, yeah.  You guys because when you were trying to throw alcohol down my throat and gone, I realize it's the same reason why I can't I don't really enjoy giving head because your guy because of my gag reflexes are just isn't so bad or good they got I don't know when you've got a gag reflex. Is that because this is what it's like when you can handle you can't you can't right exactly. That's the same reason why I well I'm sucking dick. It's not fun. It's not fun for me because I don't like things going down my throat that way. Oh shots in that because you know you guys  Always like oh you just gotta let it hit the back of your throat. I can't actually do it. Yeah, I mean so I don't taste shots. That's what I'm saying. I can't do that. So you want to be able to eat it was it muscles to say us? Me too.  So that's I like fish yet. Careful Dickie. Yeah. Oh, yeah, he should be that used to be like my least favorite song of has and then it became one of my favorite songs was it was some songs like this is a shit. Yeah. I can feel it. Worse. Destiny's Child song is girl.   Make five million. I just find it cringe. I'm sorry. If you think I'm going to be in the beach when I was younger, like wishing you the best pray that you are blessed with happiness greater than that. I'm not gonna bring it.  I'm back.  Laughing go as well darts, then you need yellow profit. I know that video camera. We press pause night Max to get changed and go again and proposed that changed last song. That was that song Big video question was if I were a boy for me. Oh, I really hate that song. I hate that song so, you know somebody hey,  He said yes to your number. I love this is crazy.  Not it's still a good song. It's just my least favorite. See what's that song? Can I hit the middle? It's the sweetest in the middle night some Bama. That's the payoff of genome esophagus or cake at Moscow www.eurovisionzone.com.   Nice that is a slut shaming sunlight, but then I still had the time of his that was when it was good to be a pick me. Yeah. Yeah, you know, I mean like that's when everyone was a pick me. Yeah, very underrated Cleese can love her love me some Kelis. I lost true also, not own the rights of jewelry. I have heard is underrated. That's Lisa's very basic which has been reading my time quote unquote underrated is because clearly said I'm not doing this shit anymore. I'm going to be the chef. Yeah. Yeah.  Millionaire is one of my all-time favorite songs. Yeah Bruno Mars way that some you know, there was nothing on that she wrote that was not milkshake because I know that's what your business does number one about like. Oh, I hate you so much right now. Yes bang on my tree wants  Me twice. No. Yeah, but album The Shining sexy there's yeah very yeah. Yeah. Yeah. She just doesn't make music just as I want to I don't stop sits and she does it. It's like really obscure. She doesn't even want everyone to hear. I don't think she believes that climate is that actually live in life what I was thinking about this the other day, you know, what's more important the producer or the songwriter? I don't know I think both because to me when the nation are you sure it's the producer because that's the beat. I think it's a combination of depends on the kind of  Thing you're making it to some songs. I just a funky beat. Oh, but actual production of a song. I can't think of Sierra yummy in my tummy. That's really amazingly produced. I thought you could you could put any lyrics in there. Okay, that's a perfect example that options, okay.  That's an amazing honor. What about the limits but is it because of the well known at the time as not an option. Yeah, but if they make money online in that Melody, but you weren't saying those words. It was still bang so you could be saying I go to the shops to buy milk.  That song I feel like even if it was a shit song. It was still banging be banging to you. It's a perfectly I think the surface it depends on. Yeah, but you're right at traffic. It's both. Yeah. It depends that for example slow jam. I don't be apartment to do that interlude and the best insulator is didn't didn't didn't the sentence that the defendant know.  No hit the gym is a great insulator. You Got It Bad guitar. Yes it is. This is what he's some everybody seems to think he can sing it but nobody can sing it because I love Whitney Houston saving on my love and it into these for that one is more shit remember on time but like institution slow jams. Yeah. Ultimately. It's the words. Yeah. Yeah.  Because something like the words the song to song that's lap three Cindy on last night's not insane.  We and I supposed to be unbeatable. Don't you think he's mad that she her husband. I mean rest in peace and everything but like he was a piece that was a bit PD a bit. She met him when she was like 10. Yeah. It was when he married her when she was at 19 and he was like in his 40s now that is why that is but no one judged it. Well, she said you've been my inspiration through the lies you were the truth. My world is a better.  Better place because right now I don't know who wrote it. But you know, it's more like growing up you'd think OK. Yeah that person you didn't know anything about gross, right? You know, you didn't know anybody like I didn't care contributing to the song and I think we ship I know but we know too much this is the problem. You're I always say that we know too much. I don't care like I'm not interested. Those are getting paid. I just I mean like my thing is I would love to work with I think yeah.  Everyone hates Justin Timberlake now, but we still love him back in the day. I didn't want he's done by papacy. Haven't we such as what he's done? Because I don't want to hate him. Yeah everyone like, I'm not going to hate everyone. Well, okay. I'll tell you I'll tell you everyone calls him a culturally appropriate now, but at the time at the time of the banging Justified we do we went think there was a time in my life. Nobody could tell me. Yeah exactly.  But it was very purposeful because even whose pink was saying that they the better as well like when she came out. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, but she's like non-black in some way. But she deny me this whole time. She's just called Alicia way and she just a white woman. Yeah. She went really well. Why is she told me yeah.  Yes, she looks quite like opening our saying that yeah, that's what they wanted to do. Like she's not gonna be she's a good way in which it's like the dad didn't help that all of this.  Not just take it on my love.  Track that's come out Morgan that I sit here and be like a Grime and yeah, so tell me about you know what we were in for a couple more minutes because it was uncomfortable to listen to what I wanted move. It was a working woman. I want to meander then the  The guys came to your door cause they wanted War the next day Heathrow Terminal four.  It because they broke everything down by - going to yeah, listen to how fast they break everything down from the beginning. So now I can understand a bit more and I guess the whole thing started with the idea of homage and this is where this whole thing is conversation out like yeah, exactly. And that's where this whole thing is kind of come from. So what do you guys think about it before we get into that? Yeah. Do you know do you know how funny it was when that American tweeted who is Storm z and y is his Willy grunting actually America one with  people at the airport  You got a terminal so then she went to the terminal. It's got the finest. No, you don't know. I was joking. Yeah paying homage. So that's where it seems like this whole thing is stems from so like I think the first for receiving homage is allowing a lot of Legends to go outside. I totally agree and this is not new scene happens if you behave when Nicki Minaj came out your new must like she didn't pay me enough how much Wonder there's an interview for Nicki Minaj wrong and giving I'm leaving.  Everybody's there when card to be came out Nicki Minaj and I still pay me homage and I'm pretty sure Nicki Minaj has said good things about I mean cardia said the things like Nicki Minaj in the past. Yeah consistently people like pay me how much I pay my homage. I'm not really a fan of homage or anything like that was carrying or giving very I'm not receiving it. I don't care about this evening. I don't care. It's even I have never been the kind of I would never sit here and be like, it was me before me I  I'm the one I'm the leader. You should know you're not no one is nasty, but I'm very aware that anything I've been allowed to do. Somebody had to do something else in order for me to allow for me. Yeah, so I am not the leader of any fucking thing. But like there's not one thing. I promise you there's nothing in this life that I've done. That was just me that yeah, even if it was the smallest somebody had to apply for this job in order for me to be able to say this. Yeah, a black woman summer has to be on television with me to say this Jesus.  Upon how to host a TV show and China forward a little bit to work in the media like so many things have to be done things with them before I was even thought about exactly before I come back maybe two things have to happen. Literally. No, I was given a chance to do anything that I'm doing now. I will never neglect that I will never do anything about that, but sorry is nobody before me but I didn't mention me that interview on this arm and this is because of that shit, you know, I totally totally agree with you. I think that people are so obsessed with the idea of being credited for things like  Because to me now when I honestly like now luckily your Kim's doing some work to kind of like be tracked all of that shit, but honestly, if she wasn't I would just see her as a bitter old record that was generous and that's what you look like and it's sad because you should go out as the Legends as an innovator. I feel like if you know that you are an innovator of something like you saying told him no one nothing Under the Sun is knew you didn't create shit. And I mean someone had to have done something for you to be in the position to be able to do what you'll do for even if you did invent something and then someone else has copied.  It's I don't need that kind of gratification for me to feel content. Like for me. Just knowing that I've done it is enough. He's right. I mean like for me as a bonus like say another podcast came and they were called the taxes and there's three girls wanted to you know, one guy in and one Nigerian and they were talking about the same things we did and it's obvious that like, they might have been inspired by us. I don't need you to come I don't need I don't need the home. He's like, please let me know if you want to I think it's a nice bonus, you know, I mean, like if people choose to be like hard to know what I started here and I was inspired by this amazing, but it's not  I think that I need so I for me like when people like getting into beefs over it because of they haven't they feel like they haven't been given their due respect or they haven't been giving their quote unquote homage. I just find it really cringe because all it says to me is that you're jealous and you're bitter and you don't want to see the movement and they evolve and and also I'm not sitting there every single interview watching the whole thing waiting to see say anything about and I'm not saying it. What is the truth? What did you expect? What is it like   Because they I don't recall that even when the receipts have been put in front of Lil Kim. She still won't acknowledge. Yeah, you know, I mean people have said it you still don't acknowledge it so it's like what more can I do and it gets to a point where I'm not going to keep on kissing your ass, especially when you have done it because they'll Rush right into me, but I know you have done it, but because you chose not to you chose to ignore the times I have said it's not good enough for you. Well, the platform is not big enough.  I feel like I'm sorry, whether it's a small platform or a big puffer. I've said it I said it and don't think just because you have said that I haven't said it enough that I'm going to now say even more I'm going to now that's not no that's gonna make me want to not exactly because I'd rather just not say anything. It's never good enough for you, especially in the world of hip-hop or Grime over every hip-hop gram of thinking ideas needs to say that the king of it. Yeah cannot be a vampire grandma is the winter and not believe in your heart that you are the best. There's probably about six to eight lepers that  Then on the king of hip-hop and yes, yeah in the world. Yeah, I'm decreasing size king of R&B. Yeah, he's still selling of his chair by Nature what it is. That's what you're meant to be cocky with it. Like this is especially when it's music and Hip-Hop. I have many things like that. Yeah and the best part. Yeah, why are you doing if you don't forget about this thing is why you doing is literally a sport isn't it? But like with Jack we share let's get so mad at him for saying it and he still said with his chest. Okay, what if you're not the best so  I think I'm the best. Yeah, why are you doing something? If you don't think my impact there was nothing. I promise you. I'll put my hand down. There's nothing that's what I'm gonna do if my impact in put it on I'm not doing it. Do you think it's wrong though that people never select say for example, someone like trapeze. He's calling himself a king of R&B. I don't think he's wrong for doing that. But do you think that like do you think that homage kind of has to be like do you think it's ever I needed?  In any circumstance, I think it's important and I think it's need to I think it's important. It's nice isn't it to appreciate people? Yeah things. Yeah. I'm taking a knowledge them. But where do you say these things then whenever you want a fucking want to do whatever you want to whatever comes to your head and you won't have to do asking me about my journey and I'm gonna be talking about someone from the past. It's like I feel like I do just choose.  But ultimate is because you want people to know that you did it. That's what it is.  You know, I mean so they might be like I walk if I gave you this platform to go public then don't thank me in private. I mean, I think it's ridiculous. But that's how and that means you're doing it for the wrong reasons because I know I know like so I know someone and they were like are they were dming someone he's at celebrity and that's what they were doing is they were posting up someone's work consistently. That's like famous. Yeah, and they were like are always posting am always posting it but they're like kind of related to this person. Yeah, and then they were like Hajj. No, I'm going to stop fucking posted it because  Wonder she never ever be post my stuff and she never ever said thank you for Miri Pope for posting her stuff. And then I just said well then that means that you doing it. You're not doing it for genuine reason. It didn't you're not doing it actually genuinely support this person you're doing it because you want recognition that you've done it. Yeah. So to me, like just don't do it then. Yeah, I don't understand why you need homage, right? If a men and I'm aware that I have two options when someone new comes along. Yeah. Shut the fuck up.  Behind you. Yeah. Yeah, I don't do it but it's I'm doing people know that my name is inadmissible in the history books on my only Italy. That's it. Yes still dusty, but I'm begging for the hundred you're not there anymore to if I like what they're doing you disposed time because for me it's sick. It makes me feel like oh I'm scared. Now that my position may be taken away your threatens, but do you think though when you're you know what you were just saying about you cosign that person if you genuinely like that. Yeah, do you think that  Times like the reason people don't want to do that is because it's like it's taking the shine away from them, but it's not like they might feel popular late night cement enough in what you build.  That you've put in all the you've sacrificed again. Nothing Under the Sun but did I ask you to knowledge that you sacrifice shit like you've created stuff and you've paved the way because a lot of the times that we're not we don't see the people that have paved the way no, I mean but so that Grime is still quite new still a baby tonight mean in the history book. So someone like widely that's paved the way he slugged his guts out for years to create what it is now and people are coming a lot and I'm not saying storms he's doing so I'm just I'm just talking and  People have come along and they're not acknowledging your hard work like imagine like but has not acknowledged him at all. Right? It's 10,000 he has exactly so that's what we're you're saying. How many times does he need to be acknowledged? Imagine you write a ten thousand word essay. And it's Lynn. It's got all these amazing points and then then but people are taking it for their work and then they're not quitting Janome. The pleasure is different, but wouldn't you be annoyed though? No. No, it's like you had a ten thousand word essay does change the laws or when it and because of your essay people can now  Cautiously. Yeah, I'll be I'm smart enough to be like, that's my legacy. Yeah, what like people I want to C be smart enough to my my legacy is that because of the that's just my story. I had to be the one to go after this. I had to be the one maybe that wasn't here in the amazing thing for your amazing money. But my legacy is that without me this wouldn't have been springboarded and that's enough Jim nice to know that she means nothing because clearly it's not enough for some people for some people like for you which ones who pay you  Monroe before you let the legacy is I would rather that, you know, the legacy is a nonprofit that people they want a physical gratification to know. I just don't like wise if it's properly that's what it is. Yeah Publix is they want some yeah that everyone can they want to be held up on a pedal stool. Literally they want to be held up on a pedestal we wanted to be what is that relevantly from the bondage? Yeah. Everyone's gonna do that. So you might as well for yourself from that bondage because people aren't always going to be able to do it and why don't I pour some pee has you weren't that inspiration? Yeah.  Someone that came off to you. You went inside. Yeah, but Sofia I thought you do it too, but it wasn't you. Yeah true. So watch now imagine someone that's cold. But like yeah, I'm so excited about pain because the rich and I think that's what was he Wiley and about 120 think that's what happens now a lot especially with these rappers, especially with that, you know, like the young rappers of getting so much stick with they don't pay because they don't say that Biggie or Tupac was their favorite red park if it wasn't there is that it was Buddy Rich. He recently said in an interview,  If you like these I you old niggas want me to say Biggie and Tupac. I wasn't even born when they were popping and Drake and Future of The Inspirations because these guys are like what 1918 and Drake is things to be features like 35. That's of course get rustic. That's what you that inspiration is gonna be my first people say Biggie and Tupac, but then it's that whole thing would be a but you should know your history. You should know where everything seems like we don't know the history of where everything fucking stems.  Well, no, I didn't say he was the first person to do you want, you know, I mean, but just gave yourself but I also think it's that thing of people what their flowers in it because I believe got him flowers. I believe when people die then we want to turn around a bit. I'll call you with a great shoot and it's like does this person have to die for us to acknowledge what I believe in keeping people their flowers. I think even if I wasn't paying homage are and like seeking homage away. Yeah, they're different. It's almost gone with their flowers give it to me. Like I think what you're doing is sick, that's enough for me. Yeah. Yeah, you have to mention my  Name in every interview where you don't need to do that like a war chose like they do like a tribute someone that still alive or whatever. Yeah, you know some people yeah, you know this person in my life that they want you to say that I think the people that are seeking it so desperate.  Wait night ends up because that face. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, literally that you're doing everything that you did was for feifei McLeod like yeah, you know, you actually wanted to pay but you can't because I need hip hop that they're happy in their house. Imagine being so secure and what you do that you'd actually your content.  What happens do they live in they've got their money or whatever and they can tip but not everybody is like I think like for me I would be content with my like my house is my homage. Yeah, I mean like the fact that my family is up. That's my homage, but for some people they want they want to hear say because they truly believe that you they made, you know, you're not that's mental. You know that you're fully but they're really not my God and I think you have to let it go because you'll drive yourself insane because look at the Wily and storms in situation. For instance. You're the one that  Saying oh, yeah, I need you need to pay some homage to muted and somebody beats you at your own craft. Exactly. Now your now you look around now you this is the thing. I just asked what makes me sad. You didn't mean the legend that you are, you know, because if he's mentioned you before that's it now, okay, if it's been acknowledged has I don't follow this in that battle, but even I've heard things Scottish inquiries, I mean, I mean, what is it with 40 was a day?   Rivals tonight means I win you do plenty become go and you become bigger than them. Now all of a sudden it's a problem. But when I was trying you don't want to know what is that person wrong for like they don't know, you know, they're not wrong what my it just falls down stairs. Honestly go away. Just go away. Yeah be happy in your legacy. My might just know that I've done this laughing.  They're like the same people that girls are talking about me enough, and I know what I've done.  Something to me and I was like, yeah, man, I went back to me. I don't believe anyone self-made. I don't like nope. I don't believe me. I did think that you put a lot of work into yourself you do a lot of things but I don't necessarily even Emotional Self Made because I feel like in order to what they want to do something slow. Do it yourself want to go far go people. That's not the same but it's the same kind of like notion sort of things. I guess. I'm a quick hard to people so but I just think the whole like it just makes let us go outside. Yeah, that was part of because now we don't remember now you want  and that offer you now cause you're fighting with your thumbs literally and all of that hard work that you put into that. It's for shit. That's the last thing people are and that takes a lot to the guys.  Chipmunk, I do love it a chipmunk has felt the need to get back to is Chipmunks when he was beaten with tiny. I said this guy's it was a cold world, but basically because yesterday I'll randomly have listened to Oopsy Daisy. Oops Yeah chipmunk.   Someone yeah. No, it was feel it was always felt an exclamation And so, why'd that happen? Yes, I am and what was going on saying I need it this early that was random and what else was random was one time. I remember when Sinead O'Connor was beaten with Arsenio Hall. Do you guys know who even those people? I know that's a yeah. I know Sinead O'Connor. Yeah, they were beefing. Well Andre fucking   His feet because I trusted my real people but not 99 and I that's exactly right on social media, but I find it very intriguing. Yeah, I think that's even very cringe of every right. I've had that there's not many people that one people that I feel do it, right Netflix Netflix strong black lead their social media lies top 10, but I've talked to you got to invent the I know sometimes that pan is this. Yeah. Yeah, but and they go to  don't worry computer. I don't know what I was thinking.  Think about the other day. Where was I and I was thinking when I was on my way to Garner and I was thinking are soon human beings actually going to be redundant because you know, when you check in now ideas like you actually don't have to have human interaction anymore. So we we wait our own bags now and then it told us that we were over Nick and I we were both over we have to pay 65 65 pounds a piece on both flights go in there such a 300 pound weight even arrived in Ghana and yeah, we ways it and then it tells you where open and I didn't have a scale I know but  I was what we're now some let my lesson and then C so it told us we were over and then you go to the machine now because before human would do it. Yeah, and now you just pee on a machine on a kiosk I didn't I had an argument with someone.  Check in as early as I can. Yeah the fun. Yeah, and so I can afford business in first class.

Now it's time to go back.  To our bedtime reading. Hi everyone. My name is Amber Lawton and you are listening to Bible at bedtime a podcast where I read the Bible to help you fall asleep. The reason I decided to start this podcast is because over the years.  I've had trouble falling asleep, and I discovered that I enjoy listening to the Bible.  But I find some narration to be difficult to follow when trying to fall asleep.  So here tonight. I'm going to read our first selection.  I decided to start with a dreamer Joseph and for tonight. This will be part one reading Genesis chapter 37 through chapter 40. So before we get started go ahead and lay down.  Finding a comfortable position.  Take a deep breath in.  And then out.  And as you breathe exhaling the stress of your day and letting your focus be on peaceful sleep as you hear the word now Genesis 37 Joseph's dreams.    Jacob lived in the land where his father had stayed the land of Canaan. These are the family records of Jacob. I 17 years of age Joseph tended sheep with his brothers. The young man was working with the sons of bilhah and zilpah his father's wives and he brought a bad report about them to their father.  Now Israel loved Joseph more than his other Sons because Joseph was a son born to him in his old age and he made a robe of Many Colors for him.  When his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers. They hated him and could not bring themselves to speak peaceably to him then Joseph had a dream.  When he told it to his brothers, they hated him even more.  He said to them listen to this dream. I had there we were binding sheaves of grain in the field. Suddenly my Sheaf stood up and your sheaves gathered around it and bow down to my Sheaf. Are you really going to Reign Over Us. His brothers asked him.  Are you really going to rule us?  So they hated him even more because of his dream and what he had said.  Then he had another dream and told it to his brothers. Look he said I had another dream and this time the sun moon and Eleven stars were bowing down to me. He told his father and brothers and his father rebuked him.  What kind of dream is this that you have had he said am I and your mother and your brothers really going to come and bow down to the ground before you?  His brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the matter in mind Joseph sold into slavery.  His brothers had gone to pasture their fathers flocks at shechem.  Israel said to Joseph your brother's, you know are pastoring the flocks at shechem. Get ready. I'm sending you to them. I'm ready Joseph replied. Then Israel said to him go and see how your brothers and the flocks are doing and bring word back to me.  So he sent him from the Hebron Valley and he went to shechem.  A man found him there wandering in the field and asked him. What are you looking for?  I'm looking for my brothers. Joseph said can you tell me where they are pastoring their flocks? They've moved on from here. The man said I heard them say let's go to Jonathan. So Joseph set out after his brothers and found them at tothen.  They saw him in the distance and before he had reached them. They plotted to kill him.  They said to one another. Oh, look here comes that dream expert so now come on. Let's kill him and throw him into one of the pits.  We can say that a vicious animal ate him then we'll see what becomes of his dreams.  When Ruben heard this he tried to save him from them. He said let's not take his life.  Rubin also said to them don't shed blood throw him into this pit in the wilderness, but don't lay a hand on him.  Intending to rescue him from them and return him to his father.  When Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped off Joseph's robe the robe of Many Colors that he had on then they took him and threw him into the pit. The pit was empty without water.  They sat down to eat a meal and when they looked up there was a caravan of Ishmael lights coming from Gilead.  Their camels were carrying aromatic gum Balsam and resin going down to Egypt.  Judah said to his brothers. What do we gain if we kill our brother and cover up his blood?  Come on, let's sell him to the ishmaelites and not lay a hand on him for he is our brother our own flesh and his brothers agreed.  When many a night Traders passed by his brothers pulled Joseph out of the pit and sold him for twenty pieces of silver to the ishmaelites who took Joseph to Egypt.  When Ruben return to the pit and saw that Joseph was not there. He tore his clothes. He went back to his brothers and said the boy is gone. What am I going to do? So they took Joseph's robe slaughtered and they'll go and dipped the robe in its blood.  They sent the robe of Many Colors to their father and said we found this examine it is it your son's robe or not. His father recognized it. It is my son's robe. He said a vicious animal has devoured him.  Joseph has been Torn to Pieces then Jacob tore his clothes put sackcloth around his waist and mourn for his son many days.  All his sons and daughters tried to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted. No, he said I will go down to Shield to my son morning and his father wept for him. Meanwhile, the midianites sold Joseph in Egypt to potiphar and officer of pharaoh and the captain of the guards.  chapter 39  Joseph in Potiphar's house   Now Joseph had been taken to Egypt and Egyptian named potiphar and officer of pharaoh and the captain of the guards bought him from the ishmaelites who had brought him there.  The Lord was with Joseph and he became a successful man serving in the household of his Egyptian master.  When his master saw that the Lord was with him and that the Lord made everything. He did successful Joseph found favor with his master and became his personal attendant.  Potiphar also put him in charge of his household and placed all that. He owned under his authority.  From the time that he put him in charge of this household and all that. He owned the Lord blessed the Egyptians house because of Joseph. The Lord's blessing was on all that. He owned in his house and in his Fields, he left all that. He owned under Joseph's Authority. He did not concern himself with anything except the food he ate.  Now Joseph was well-built and handsome after some time. His master's wife looked longingly at Joseph and said sleep with me, but he refused look he said to his master's wife with me here. My master does not concern himself with anything in his house.  And he has put all that he owns under my authority.  No one in this house is greater than I am. He has withheld nothing from me except you because you are his wife.  So, how could I do this immense evil? And how could I sin against God although she spoke to Joseph day after day he refused to go to bed with her.  Now one day he went into the house to do his work.  And none of the household servants were there.  She grabbed him by his garment and said sleep with me.  But leaving His Garment in her hand, he escaped and ran outside.  When she saw that he had left His Garment with her and had run outside. She called her household servants. Look she said to them my husband brought a Hebrew man to make fools of us. He came to me so he could sleep with me and I screamed as loud as I could.  When he heard me screaming for help, he left his garment beside me and ran outside.  She put Joseph's garment beside her until his master came home. Then she told him the same story.  The Hebrew slave you brought to us came to make a fool of me. But when I screamed for help, he left his garment beside me and ran outside.  When his master heard the story his wife told him. These are the things your slave did to me. He was Furious and had him thrown into prison where the Kings prisoners were confined. So Joseph was there in prison  Joseph in prison  But the Lord was with Joseph and extended kindness to him. He granted him favor with the prison Warden the warden put all the prisoners.  Who are in prison under Joseph's Authority and he was responsible for everything that was done there.  The warden did not bother with anything under Joseph's Authority because the Lord was with him and the Lord made everything that he did successful.  chapter 40  Joseph interprets to prisoners dreams   After this the king of Egypt's cupbearer and Baker offended their Master the king of Egypt Pharaoh was angry with his two officers the chief cupbearer and the chief Baker and put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guards in the prison where Joseph was confined.  The captain of the guards assigned Joseph to them as their personal attendant and they were in custody for some time the king of Egypt's cupbearer and Baker who were confined in the prison.  each had a dream  both had a dream on the same night and each dream had its own meaning.  When Joseph came to them in the morning, he saw that they looked distraught. So he asked pharaohs officers who were in custody with him and his master's house. Why do you look so sad today?  We had dreams they said to him but there is no one to interpret them. Then Joseph said to them don't interpretations belong to God. Tell me your dreams.  So the chief cupbearer told his dream to Joseph in my dream. There was a Vine in front of me on the vine were three branches as soon as it budded it blossoms come out and it clusters ripened into grapes.  Pharaoh's cup was in my hand and I took the grapes squeeze them into Pharaoh's cup and place the cup in Pharaoh's hand.  This is its interpretation. Joseph said to him the three branches are three days in just three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your position. You will put Pharaoh's Cup in his hand the way you used to when you are his cupbearer.  But when all goes well for you remember that I was with you. Please show kindness to me by mentioning me to pharaoh and get me out of this prison for I was kidnapped from the land of the Hebrews and even here I have done nothing that they should put me in the dungeon.  When the chief Baker saw that the interpretation was positive. He said to Joseph. I also had a dream three baskets of white bread were on my head in the top basket were all sorts of baked goods for Pharaoh, but the birds were eating them out of the baskets on my head.  This is its interpretation. Joseph replied the three baskets are three days in just three days Pharaoh will lift up your head from off you and hang you on a tree.  Then the birds will eat the flesh from your body.  On the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday. He gave A Feast for all his servants. He elevated the chief cupbearer and the chief Baker among his servants Pharaoh restore the chief cupbearer to his position as cupbearer and he placed the cup in Pharaoh's hand. But Pharaoh hang to the chief Baker just as Joseph had explained to them.  Yet the chief cupbearer did not remember Joseph he forgot him.  That's it for tonight's reading. Hopefully you have fallen asleep tomorrow. We will continue.  with chapter 41   sleep well tonight.  And rest knowing that the Lord is with you. Good night.

spotify:episode:6iQEqeGYXAGUWcIcaGac8C	Hi, my name is Kate's cooker. And this is your everyday positivity here on Vale. So goal setting I need to talk to you about goal setting there are a few tricks around goal-setting. Sometimes it's about making sure that there's one clear goal. And at this time of the year you can end up with having loads of goals. There's another trick around goal setting and that is this if you had a goal in 2019 that you look at back at your kind of December January time, and he's written down and go. Oh, I didn't do that goal. I'm here to tell you. That it's okay. So I had a goal. I wanted to play the piano by the time I was 40 and for one reason or another that goal has been put by the wayside mainly because I wanted to be able to send you stuff but Facebook kept on telling me I couldn't because it had like a real song in it. So I've kept that goal and I'm going to stick to that goal and I'm going to make sure that I work to that goal in 2020.  It's a shame. I didn't make it to the my 40th birthday playing piano in the street Your Song by Elton John. That's what I wanted to do. Equally if I beat myself up about not achieving that goal when I know that it's still something that I could do. Then I think that I've done myself a disservice. So it's something I want to do. I'm going to extend the goal and as should you if you have not quite achieved what you wanted to achieve it's not about making sure that you beat yourself up about it. It's about making sure that you look at it and go right? Why didn't that happen? What was it about that goal that  It didn't happen and how could I make it happen again? So cut yourself some slack. Give yourself a break. Look at those goals from 2019 that maybe you didn't achieve and think about how 2020 could be your year. All right, make sure you check in the Facebook group today everyday positivity with Kate's Cocker. There's a video in there about how you can move your Wheel of Life discoveries from the last week or so and turn them into goals. And then tomorrow in the Facebook group. I will be doing a Facebook live around how you can set some good goals for 2020.  NT and indeed potentially the next decade so check out Facebook every day positivity with Kate Cocker come and join.

So I think we're even I actually had a conversation maybe not with Mom with myself and the internet. Well, how'd that go taking myself off with it? I had a good conversation with myself.

It, Mendota Heights, Minnesota.  That's pretty small to you really? Like people could find you. We lost that pretty easily.  If you have that it we're staring out the window right now. So and he let me back up a second. Excuse me. I'm going to throw it to my state champion co-host. Yeah. Well, we're going to get state champion co-host in Mendota Heights Minnesota the second third for today the second half on most days of the co-hosting group. Duo/trio. Whatever it is on any given day. My dad Scott Applebaum if that is still your name out you've gone.  Well, that's that's not my real name. That's my podcast name. That's my stage name why you've gone through a bit of a crisis in the meantime. I just want to make sure yeah when that's the name they gave me when I was at chunkin Dale's for a little bit. We'll get to our third guest because he you know, if this tryout chunkin Dale's yeah, I work for chunkin Dale's but it's like Chippendales. But let's like the Chris Farley version ship and yeah, and I really don't want to get into that because now I'm now that I don't have to do that anymore. Now that we're back in the podcast. Oh, yeah. Yeah, so I had gotta do it. You gotta do it.  Make a dollar I get it. Yeah. Yeah, and it was weird because I did use brick house as my opening while listen what you know, then I close with We are family not I mean spoiler alert at the end of the show. You might hear that. We haven't really we're not going to lie very I have to buy that here too far. You don't have closing music yet. Well now while listen I got the rest of the should I make it out. Yeah, we're going to get to our third guest who's sort of on a he's been on before but this might be a trial because if  He if it goes well, I mean we could do New York. So we got the East Coast we got the West Coast if it goes well and he went and he can do it from there. So we'd be bicoastal which as everyone knows we're very accepting of the LBG T QR s community and then me and the Midwest I'm in the mid west coast what I knew that's exactly you're going to say and I was kind of hoping you weren't actually going to say that but I was that bad.  There were no it was just it was it was funny I guess. Oh, thank you. So I mean the mid west coast we if it works will have people will have each clothes covered all different time zones, but we'll see he's  On a trial but on this very first return if it does well on episodes he joins will splice in California love maybe into the we're going to drip that we're going to get to why he might be on because I think we have a huge audience from his school that we're going to get to but not quite yet on today's return show.  Yes, we do have a kdz episode. We'll see how that goes. If there's anyone that I'm I'm I'm confident still has it after all this time. It's her. Yeah, myself skeptical. You definitely don't have it start our third member that you still haven't actually formally introduced. We'll see I don't heard it's a fan but that's no down. Did I doubt I'd forgot to mute my mic when I said that um,  But we will have ktz. However for those returning Orchard members wondering about Wyatt.  He's I got some sad news yet. He is alive but shortly after our show concluded. He did need to go in the witness protection program and it's a shame for a number of reasons one with I miss him. I miss him too. One two, I had a lot of really good ideas for what we could do with this show and his expertise and wisdom and Equipment were needed to do that. And I just I'm not gonna be able to do  Her well the things I thought of I was gonna I was gonna play the We Are Family Music and I was going to cut to the Undertaker music or the stone cold music. I haven't fully decided but I was going to cut to one of those I was going to try and find I had all these grandiose plans and then he I tried to contact them and I the FBI showed up at my door and said don't ever do that again. Well, we're working on getting him out because without Wyatt then of course, we don't have why it's Corona one-hit wonders of the week the Quran.  Apart, we'd have to probably leave out and that was a huge part of that was probably one of my favorite parts of the show. So we're going to try to get over there were a number of people by a number and that number is like two that were like, well you still going to do the music thing and I was like, I maybe I'm probably not because we don't have why it but  I have breaking news.  From a lady named Sue Charlie Blackmon has the all-time worst baseball beard ever.  She's not a big she is not a big athlete beard person if I know anything about her from you know, I have known her my whole life. I don't know if you know that she's not the same with her son. Well, she's known me my whole life that would make sense. It'd be weird if I knew her and she didn't know me, but if I've learned if I've learned a few things one of them is that she hates athletes with beards. She hates large beards, I think in general but I think athletes with beard specifically no-go for her. So I just wanted to get that out there since she felt the need to text me immediately this  Not like no, she knows hundred for me. No, no, she's weird in an undisclosed part of the house. But anyways, so why we're working on Wyatt. Hopefully if the show lasts more than two or three, which I think it could we'll try to get him back in some respect so know why it yet, but we're working on it. You know, I'm hoping as we bring this show back. We'll hear it from some of our old friends doc. The doctor doctor goog. I'm sure at some point.  Point I'll be chiming in remember the representative Stanford Stanford.  Yes, what about why I'm hoping he Chimes back in he was a little nutty and some of our old friends. We got Sheamus Harvey some of our old friends were hoping but I think we're going to get some new friends and now is a better time than any to introduce our third member of the bicoastal again. We're very accepting Trio for now the be an lgbtq R stands for bicoastal. Yep bicoastal, right? He is wearing rainbow.  He always does but that's beside the point. He's wearing his rainbow outfit. So once again Orchard and we'll get to why he's really on because of where he's going to school the one and only Sam no relation Applebaum Sam what he had to say for yourself for all the old listeners and especially the newest nursers.  This is the voice of Sam. No relation Appelbaum and I am honored to be a part of the first show and I'm happy to take the show Coast-to-Coast. Hopefully if my tryout goes well and if the show goes well because I will not be going back for a few months, right? So yeah, we got to make it there. So we'll just be from the mid west coast for if sent with Sam for a while, and I'm not so happy that I'm being used.  Just because I go to school on the west coast. So anyway, so Sam goes to college at Santa Clara University. Hold on. I have I have I have a question. Yeah, go ahead. I know it's been a while since I've since I've seen Sam. Yeah. Did you develop a lisp since I last saw, you know, it's a little weird because I'm hearing double with this new thing while he's doesn't mean you have to speak double and it's weird cause he's sitting on my lap, but I'm virtus train. So that's okay. So I'm just saying it just because you're hearing double doesn't mean any  Double but that's because at that point I didn't want to call him out right away, but I'm glad you did so I knew he would probably punch you in the face. If you did I was looking at him like what you talking about Willis for those of you that are old enough to drink actually not anyways, it's gonna resign. Anyways, I digress Sam went and still goes to Santa Clara University. He's got a ton of friends that know he's got a ton of acquaintances there. I don't know if there's friends he dabbled in a little radio show with one of his roommates, but as a dishing it out the dish the dish man.  And dishing it out. I'll Reserve comments and Dish and they did well, so I think we can either you know, how we used to have not used to we're going to do it again and we had our listeners chimed in with questions and comments. I think Sam's group. We very active on the old Twitter torquing machine. So it's working machine and the twerking is he being used partly. Yeah, do we feel sorry for him partly? I am I would say the majority majority happens. There's all tier.  It's like 75 percent and fifty percent. So it's a it's a it's a it's a good it's a really good segue. I don't know if you noticed Segway is that but it's a good one. It's that the thing is I'd that to two wheels because you know, what are those up?  You know, what are what are our Twitter handle is right now start working handle. I know you know what that is, but our Twitter handle is what at Apples to Apples PC follow us on Twitter everybody. We're very PC. I didn't actually mean that at the time just the Apples to Apples is already so I think it just adds something and I went with PC which is looking back on it. Not the best call but whatever so Samuel and Sam will be kind of on a summer tryout period  Hopefully it goes a little bit better than his baseball career, but you never can all be winners like you. All right. Well now that we're on the topic we got I got a shout out that I have to give that's how you segue Drew. That's a segue. I thought that one was stinky ride. That's what I thought too. But so for those of you familiar and not familiar the st. Thomas Academy Cadet baseball team this year or last year for listening a year from now, but that would be untimely.  one the stick Minnesota state championship in baseball  I don't believe either one of you two did that when you played there, but I could be wrong now. I don't think Syrian. No objections Sam got the state. Not sure what your deal is Drew. But that's fine. It does. Listen. I'm only one guy through one not very good player on a on a bigger teams like the whole plan of the roots and then you blossomed. So whatever that I didn't do much so the shout out has to go  to coach Matt Kelly head coach Matt Kelly  assistant coach Brian Myers, you know Brian, I don't very well. Yeah, so do I so I actually know you probably taught him everything he knew now I second time. I did Coach Dylan Welter. You don't know Dylan very nice guy great coach. I don't and then the two last but not least coaching key.  And for sure, not last but not least coach mono. So those big shout out to those guys matters and go I'm sorry and Coach nadders. They coaching staff.  Sorry, coach nadders and then the entire team which I'm not going to list off but it's pretty crazy run got to play at Target Field beep benilde and won the state championship. So they're going to be chiming in to we're going to we might even have them on as a guest to talk to a state champion right now. There's no what it feels like Walden enough. Yeah one isn't enough right now. They're being sized. This is not a lie. They're being size for their championship rings.  Cool. Yeah, very cool and is multi diamonds and sapphires and stuff like that. Oh my yeah. Yeah, that's pretty cool. I can't even well, I wouldn't know how but there's a picture that could be posted. Its you don't know how to do much so I know that's why I don't want to throw that out there. So huge shout out to coach Kelly and the boys.  Coaches and players is pretty cool. And again, we'll talk about them a little further down the road.  thoughts  on on them. Yeah, you know, it's actually it's funny. I knew obviously follow the team. It's my alma mater. I'm very 132 that to I sort of know. I'm actually I'm very close with one coach and then I guess I know you too and I knew the championship game was going on and I randomly like founded somewhere online and literally watched the last two outs and it was pretty cool. I mean, it's the  Correct me if I'm wrong the first time the history of the school two years ago. There was the first time they'd gone in 40 some years. We won the consolation championship. And this year is the first time they won the championship. That's and that's that's pretty cool. So I you know, congratulations to all those guys. It's no it's no simple feat to to do that. And I you know it I can only imagine how much fun it was and I'm sorry about breaking news. We'll get right back.  Back to it. Apparently Charlie also has a mullet mom. Just I mean Sue just chimed in again. Oh, yeah. No the guy for the Rockies now. I know exactly just talking about I know that but anyways, if for those of you in town, July 18th, the team will be honored on the field before the Twins game at Target Field. That's awesome. Yeah, it's pretty fun. And then I think I don't know what else Sibley got a parade. I'm pretty sure st. Thomas well, but the man time to move on. Well, we just have to be a really long right?  When you just have to be very long, but although you know with traffic it's going to be long anyway, so so anyways, so there's there's a little news now. What have we been doing the last couple of years? I don't think we're ain't getting any of that. Do I don't think anyone cares at all know we need to move on. I will say we're going to talk sports after kdz, which we're going to get to shortly. I will say, let's just briefly recap where I was Sports. Let's see Vikings when we last left. You were disappointment. Oh, yeah.  Something probably won't make the playoffs this year. Second toughest schedule wild average at best disappointment bag goaltending and we're right back there again. Let's see Timberwolves. Don't I did I just say yeah Timberwolves. I mean, what do you say about them? Same thing? We couldn't really not say last time you're on the air. Now the twins at least they're trying the twins are trying they've also given up temples, but the twins to yeah, the twins, you know had a 13 14 game lead, that wasn't good enough, so  We whittled it down to five and the ones they schedule in the major leagues in the second half. Well, that's good. They're going to need that the the interesting and the one cool thing about the twins. That although we I did profess that once we got rid of our we'd be better. So I wasn't totally wrong but the cool thing that the twins still do and it doesn't really matter who the general manager is. They still pretend like we're going to make big trades and sign big guys and then we don't so that's cool because they're still on that really sure what you wanted them to do. So like the trade deadline is in 20 date like they're  But I want you to really confused in there were out there that we chose not to partake you guys from Houston. Oh my God, my battery's running on my computer. I battery what two guys from Houston Kimbrel and the keuchel stinks Kimbrel did play for Houston and Kimbrough has been crap since you know, but are seven relief pitchers are so good and Gibson see everyone so we have one very good one who Rogers? Yeah. Mr. Rogers. Okay, he can only p camp pitch a read-only your I said one and I'm not denying we needed and we need more.  They do need more let's and when other one other relief pitchers start getting traded for and we're left in the outside. Then I will be on your side of this but we got like let them let them screw up before like they do have a five and a half game lead in the central in a season. We thought would all be we'd maybe at best sort of be in the Wild Card race. They have what is the number? What is the number one offense in baseball a lot of categories? They're a ton of fun to watch and I think they've spoiled us a little bit. Like you said, we had a we had a large lead.  Having us an easy schedule at the Indian struggled a little bit. They've gotten a little bit back on track, but they had an easy schedule for a little bit while we had a difficult one. We have the easiest schedule in the second half of the Season, you know, I hope and like I said if they don't I will be right there with you thrashing them that I hope they make a move. It's they've had guys hurt. They've had guys hurt. I mean in their in their slight defense, but I think of nothing else to season so far has been a pleasant surprise and the only reason people are making a mistake right the only reason people  You are getting so upset is because we were spoiled. For example, Houston Houston lost eight straight games. Nobody over there is panicking because of guess what I've kind of been there and guess what if they need a picture. They're gonna go get one if they need to get on TV. Aw. No, but they were stationed lately but no Sam no give him three weeks before you yell about them not doing anything. But listen, yeah, they could be too. Yeah. We're on the All-Star break right now Pakistan.  My charger this isn't happening. Oh, here's Sam. If you're asking about me. I like Drew DQ Wonderwall because I for one thing that has changed in the past two years the Minnesota F you are on fire. I that's true a huge win last few days ago in Montreal third straight fifth straight to up to third in their cop who makes the playoffs by the way, we're talking soccer. For those of you uninformed without Drew. We thought wrong way. Yeah. I know I  Actually watch soccer. It was on the road in Montreal so they could not play Wonderwall, but you know, there's still people there. Yeah, but you and I Dad we sang it we did I watched him in Montreal that's sad. But so that is one thing true soda has going for them. Well, that's a good point in these idiots when it's a hundred twenty degrees still wear their scarves. So  I don't it's like a cult. I don't quite understand it.  Yeah, well, it does help when there is no parking at the stadium and we need that so I don't know how you walk you through miles just to get there. All right, I'll give you the third a little bit. Well, they couldn't be any worse. It's only their what their third year isn't that a lot of soccer talk for the first show back. To be honest with you. This is going to become a soccer podcast. I'm all in on the lunita all in. Okay Wonderwall. I'm all in on the loans. I have to say it with a really deep English accent though. Then I just saying Wonder well while you're gone. Okay. Well, I'll see if  I can maybe I can work that in somehow. Let's see how see what what anchor can do for us. I also managed to do to fix the URLs. Now. It's anchored on FM / apples - two - apples. Well, that's a relief right now. You have to see my name all the time. That's a huge relief. But ya know let's go arms up anything. I need before we're going to get the kdz. I think now this one I'm gonna give up. Oh, go ahead. No, I'm just gonna give you each a chance to you know, you know, there's anything been on your mind the last year and a half.  To take years if you haven't really been able to chime in on.  A lot but I make the people are gonna listen this probably heard me complain about it already. Anyway, well, I you don't know everyone that was  I promise you if they didn't hear me talk about already and they don't want to so I got I you know, so it's been it's been a tough year and a half if there's one thing I've missed is kdz. Do you have mascara? She just texted me a picture of this basketball. Where were you playing bouncing out? There's no video here. I just looked at Sammy's got a Shiner. I thought he had mascara. Tell it talk to your buddy Andrew Johnson about that. I just saw him today.  Mom Haiti was Soo is is texting me pictures of this guy, but I know I know does she not know that you have a semi-successful sports podcast. You can see is Rusty in this whole thing. She doesn't she forgets but although she did that before too. So maybe you know what maybe we're all just kind of back on track.  That's true. She used to always call in the middle of it. Now. I got I got I got nothing. I'm happy to be back don't know yet. I think especially being bicoastal and being so accepting. I think that's going to be really good. It's a whole new world. Oh definitely wasn't before and it can't get any worse so true. But this show is really dependent on the Old Orchard the new Orchard everyone chiming in you know to tweet us to work us your thoughts comments even complaints will take them.  I'm like, there's got to be a few at Apples to Apples PC. It's also in our anchor. Apparently we have a face smile. Anyway, I don't know anything about Facebook but we do okay, let's it's less utilized in 2019. It's so do we still have my space? I don't even we've never had it. I don't even know if it still exists. So it doesn't it. May Stone. I never I never even had well, I'll joking aside. Should we just jump into Katie's and then we'll talk some sports to wrap it up. Yeah, let's do it. All right.   I guess it's time for kdz. I don't know if I have the intro music. I was just thinking about it. Oh, it's you know, they don't have to tell Katie. I'm gonna have to find her some new intro music I can put it together, but I'll need to find some 400 maybe next week, but just play it right now. Maybe I'll give her Wonderwall that would be bad and go.  Hello Orchard, it's Katie here to give you a quick new edition of K Dee Zee your sports celebrity. Gossip super long time. No talk and no there is no JK after that because it has seriously been a long long long minute. Hope all is well with you and you are all having a fun summer, which by the way the fourth is over and so now basically  So a summer SMH and cry face. Okay. So first up let's all join me in congratulating the u.s. Women's soccer team for winning the Women's World Cup. Yes. It was amazing. Right sure honestly and no digs to women's soccer or soccer in general. I mean, my son plays soccer, but I did not really watch but hey once again congrats to them. Oh, you know what? That means you don't well, I will tell you.  It means that they get to go on the trip to the White House yippee or well maybe not so much According to some of the players on the team as in not going if invited how patriotic of them. Hhn enough said on that. So, okay. I really don't have a lot of earth-shattering sports stuff to talk with you about this week. So I thought I would do wot W for those of you who may not  Member or know what that means. I will tell you right now ready. Okay, it's worth of the week. Okay, here it is a plum now, I will spell it out for you because I'm not sure that I'm pronouncing it correctly. But it's a PLO MB meaning is as follows self confident Assurance skill and Poise, especially in difficult or challenging circumstances.  Okay. Now our present to you with a sentence using the word Mark received a job offer because of his ability to handle tasks with a bomb Orchard. That's all I have for you today. Remember to use the word of the week, which I'm not going to say again because I'm not really sure I'm saying it right. Anyway, it's just a quick Kate easy for you this week. Hope to talk at you soon again, Katie out.  Oh, guess what? I forgot. Go twins. Yay. We're number one right now. Let's keep it moving right of course right. Ciao.  And we're back. Wasn't that a skit from?  Yes, it wasn't. Yeah, and we're back quite an addition of ke zi Shi Yu is cry face. Is that a new?  Tournament remote that's an emoji is the I think she's referring to the Emoji but it's so she threw the cry face in there and then no digs soccer. I guess. I don't really understand what that meant. But she did congratulate as we all do and we probably were going to get to that the  controversial United States women's soccer squad on their way in so thanks Katie for that's in two different soccer mentions, by the way in the same podcast. I know this one. Well, this one is a little bit more. I mean this one we would always it's World chi chi right here, right? No, you're right. I'm more just telling you this is it's slowly but surely moving that direction. She mentioned that they're going to be invited to the White House but not go I am so sick of it. I don't even care anymore. Don't go don't invite any.  Who cares?  Are they going to be invited I dial I want to invite them. They just said they're not gonna go so don't invite him. But you know what? I forgot that she did. Who's she there's that they're teenagers Katie Oh, I thought you meant one of the soccer Grim reality. She was with Katie's he's apparently she's hitting it big and she was on our show. Apparently. She's hitting it big in Hollywood. I don't know if she'll remember us one day. I there's no way I promise you. I'm sure she's already forgot us. But yeah, I guess she's a Netflix and a bunch of stuff. She was on our show, you know, I hope  us  Wyatt Wyatt. Well, why it for sure I think goes without saying I miss him Kevin Club. Yeah, I was gonna say your old friends your old friend Kendall Kendall. Hey pigs. She's on the ground season take box channel. Nine news are in the morning. She's in the morning because she's she did a big left us for nothing. I know we'll have to make her come back on. Yeah. Well, she she would never give this up. Of course, she'll come back. We probably need permission now from Channel 9. No.  I promise you that will be a very highly scrutinized episode. That'll that'll need to go through some some, you know, they're not so great either. So we're not going to run their candle and Kevin know Kendall's great. I'm talking about the Fox 9 Morning Show, so she'll be fine. Well, I can't believe you just said that and I'll let me know if she comes on our show. I meant we can't we're not going to ruin their show. They should let her come on.  I'm just saying I can't you shouldn't have said that when we're trying is that wasn't bad.  Well, then have two or maybe two out of five. Is there five like major news networks ABC NBC CBS. Well, we got Frank or I'm saying we have two out of five or two out of four major News Network personalities. Yeah. I just talked to him the other day. I'm sure he'd be well he had to get permission to come on to see that's what I'm saying. You shouldn't trust their trash. They're hella trashing them. I'm just saying we're not going to ruin their not nice things to say. I did have nice things this in fact, it's the only station I watch in the morning.  So don't tell Frank that he will he's not on in the morning. He's on then you can tell him that yeah, I stay I'll stand by. So I forgot the katydid the word of the week.  And she wasn't sure how to pronounce it which is really no shocker because she doesn't know how to pronounce anything but aplomb.  I you pronounce it correctly.  Okay.  She must be really excited when the spelling bee comes. I was just thinking of that but we'll rigging news. Oh breaking news Sue has texted me. Okay. Have you guys not been responding? No, I don't kind of busy. I am am being I'm trying to be professional. She wants to know why don't the Yankees have names on their jerseys tell her it's tradition. They also don't have beards. So she said they're not allowed to have facial hair so she should love them. So she should like the Yankees.  Then Katie as you guys all heard the expression don't the Yankees have names but I hear sorry Katie gave a shout out and a congratulations to the twins, which is probably the kiss of death. So it's not that they didn't have their own. That's it's a fair point. That's a fair point. I might as well just go sour on them, but welcome ktz back. It was brief to the point and kind of just, you know at eased back exact opposite of the rest of the show and her  Mille segments which will be you know, she'll be a regular she'll be back at your comments at Katie.  Anything else guys? I'm Kate easy just happy to have her back. It's such a crucial segment. We could have done this this first episode without her and we want the Sam. Well, of course, I could have spoken it better myself. I'm just really distracted by his Schreiner. I didn't notice it. I mean I'm used to wearing mascara, but it's not fully it's just in the corner. So that's why I realized it wasn't the mascara. But anyway, Sam's mascara has nothing to do with anything.  Right now sure some everything to do something. It does actually but when you get that we don't have time trying to extend to another Community. That's right. He lives out in the Silicon Valley.  Anyways, I think we need to talk some sports. You know, what I want to start with a spot beginning that's usually where I want to start but this is I'm actually starting at the end well because I will never watch this league ever a gain as Chris Jericho and said the NBA I have to say I have zero interest isn't fair. I have less than zero interest in the NBA.  Thoughts you too. Why do you listen zero interest? Oh you like you need to expand on that because I because I am so well clearly the players run the league. So I don't want to address here hundred percent sure. I don't want to ever ever hear them complain about owners the word owner know they run the entire league and if they're good guys that suck make ten million dollars a year guys. That's sort of suck make 15  Lillian and if you just awful you make five to seven million a year, it's insane now having said that here's what I'll say. I can't go here unless you come with I mean jeez, it's ridiculous the whole. Yeah the yeah. No, that's I mean, I don't hate I don't disagree with your well, I don't disagree with anything. You said I don't hate that. I'm not going here unless you come with me think just because I think it makes for some pretty fun teams to watch. Yeah for the factually it's crazy to say but it actually almost in a way split up some like, you know, bigger.  Super power is teams and that it was still in the same scenario where it's only a small number of teams have a chance, but at least now that numbers larger than 3 it's like 6 and here that I will say though that I absolutely absolutely agree with like the players run the league if you demand a trade in the NFL you're getting sent to Buffalo. You're not getting sent to Miami. Where do you want to go? Like they're like bending over backwards to try and like and you know, I would honestly almost  Argue as they should for some of these players that have given them so much. They should want to help them go from one place to another go to where they want to be if they can make it work financially for their own teams, but at the end of the day, I agree with you like they they run things and it's not that and it is not that way in other leagues. If you demand a trade another League you're getting sent wherever they want to send you and it's not going to be somewhere you like Michael. Jordan would not be team. I mean he was on a good team, but he was on the team they drafted the guys rod.  In the got in a trade, but the he would not be calling is to team up with them not a chance and this is I mean and it just it LeBron James he can't eat you know, he gets his you know, he owns. What's his name Anthony Davis he owns him because of his agency owns them, but they couldn't get anyone else. No one else and then Kawhi Leonard wasn't I mean I get it. I understand he doesn't live in Toronto. I understand. He's probably in a better team but really, I mean, I'll come here if you get this.  And then like you said, they go get it's ridiculous that it should be the NBA in the mbb. So take the six teams that anyone cares about and Utah and Denver going to be really good but they're I mean, they're not going to now they'll be really good and they'll be top. I mean, I guess in the west now they'll they will easily make the playoffs but they don't stand a chance against some of the other teams Leonard went to LA because he's from La he didn't want to go to town. You know, it does go back a little bit when I said he didn't want to go to Toronto necessarily like that was a tray that he may not have had a lot of  of impact on Toronto traded for him to have exactly what happened happened. They traded him knowing they probably weren't going to re-sign him but they thought he could win a championship and he want him a championship and that's all they wanted from him. So when he left it was like, you know what thank you. It's what we wanted. Good luck in La I have found out he's from La for what's right, but I agree. It's like the guy I'll come out only come to you. If you also get this guy no one thought he was going to the Clippers until the day he went to the Clippers and all of a sudden Paul. George is going to  So it's I think it makes for some exciting free agency. Honestly, I think it's pretty crazy. And to be honest if if I was a more.  Like if I was a fan of a more borderline team, you know, let's say I was a Celtics fan or I was a you know, even in Miami Heat fan now that they have Jimmy Butler like some of those more well good luck with that. Idiot for a number of reasons. If I was a more kind of borderline a fan of a more borderline team like that. I would be upset with this stuff but the term will suck so much. All I can do is to enjoy the league as a whole and and you know, watch the fun games with the fun teams when they're on on and enjoy kind of the commune. Oh,  There is no doubt that the Clippers were still Lakers will be fun games to watch or or a lot of those other teams in the playoffs will be fun and it'll add a small it'll add a new twist. There's new guys all over the place and but the fact that the Timberwolves won't even sniff. The playoffs is like makes me more interested actually in the league as a whole. I have a question for you, too.  And I'm going to start it with the statement that's normally a weird way to ask a question. But whatever. I despise Russell Westbrook already know you're going to hate. I agree. Absolutely despise them Sam no relation. I'll go to you first. The only chance to Timberwolves have of even being semi interested is if they trade for him true or false entry semi-interesting or like us and that's for Sam first, not you back interesting by the fans. Thank you.  Yeah question as well, oh let me rephrase it and the only reason the only way this the Timberwolves will be even close to being interesting this year is if they trade for the guy that I hate the most in the NBA actually I don't hate him the most anymore. He's like V on my list some guys have gone ahead of them but is that a true statement or a false statement Sam no relation I'd say it's true but I don't know if he'd be interested in a good way because likely karl-anthony towns may want to leave because  has no one wants to play with Westbrook or the other way around Westbrook will want to leave after 2 months still risk you take  I do not think we should trade for him, but it would certainly be more interesting. I don't think we have a choice but Drew go ahead. I think you look at this here as just  A lost cause well like the last 20. Okay. Well, they've all been long but that's like no I know but I think I think they made the run at their guy and Russell they didn't give them because he wanted to play for the Warriors and I can't blame him. He's not even a play for him for like a month and they're getting and then and maybe we can get them into who knows but my point I guess my point was I agree with Sam in the sense that I don't like Russell Westbrook makes you a very good team, but it's probably only going to run it because another Jimmy  Type of situation it's going to kind of stunt cats great cats growth a little bit. And if that's the guy you're trying to build around you see through this year. You let Tiegs count contract comes off the book. You look to move Wiggins if you can or if you think you need to I think corgis contract might be up after this year or not. You look to move him because he's an expiring contract and you can do that and then you go get your you go get it you go get a start-up play with cat. I agree with Sam that I don't like Westbrook is a Band-Aid to maybe you  no win some games this year, but you're not going to those two together is not going to help cat in the long run. It's not going to help the team in the long run and you have this new regime Saunders officially has the keys. I think you let them work through what they want to do is a team and you let some of those that those bad dollars come off the book at the end of the year and start fresh before we did leave it goes to show this off season goes to show just how much Thibodeau screwed this team up every single decision that we are hand.  By is his fault. Well part of what I was going to say. Is this new regime thing we seem to have new regimes all the time. So I just I have no interest. Yeah, but I wouldn't say Glen Taylor is the best judge of talent, but that's a separate discussion. Now, he's terribly he's a terrible this case. I think I think this guy I think Rose awesome these guys that they he's got sort of know. I think they know what they're doing more than anyone else. We've had it for me to just flip. Hopefully they win the summer league and we can hang II although I love the summer league. I love all those  Oh, we are looky there that guy that rookie that we just signed isn't playing in the summer league so he can get caught up. Isn't that what the summer leaks for? What am I missing Advocates? Not Saunders isn't coach summer league. He's just he's working with Saunders Town wagons, but I'm on the court. Are you kiddo stupid whatever. This is stupid. All right, but why put him on the court with nine guys, he's not going to play with I want you two guys to explain to me how the Vikings are going to get in the playoffs with a below-average defense overrated deep.  The bags are so bad. I could catch a pass on them and I believe there is no there are there is okay. Well, there's no killer average. Yeah, I was gonna say anything but average I think I think defensive backs in the NFL are just playing at a any kind of your grill just sucks. We out the deal. What's the guy true? But what's that horrible guy from Michigan State? I can't remember his name. He's so bad Trae Waynes. Yes, awful Hughes is pretty good, but he can't walk anymore. So I guess yeah Alexander is might be the best out of the three.  Okay. Well there were going to hang out ahead on them. So no I'm so I want you to but like there's what there's no really really good. There's very few very good defensive back fields, except for the teams with really good defense as but in any case, I don't think I don't let me get to my question. I think it's I think it's a defense as a whole and I think you're I want you to yeah number 28 and 29 exactly. Those are ours. No as of 26, the Bears defense is better than ours. But having said that they were  Okay, it's like I'm gonna give you a how much I forgot. You know what I think I'm second-guessing doing this testing. One two, testing one two, if you two would let me get the question on him and let you come if you didn't have such stupid things to say we would let you I'm a it's not a stupid question. I want you to convince me with the second toughest schedule in the league next this year coming up how we're going to make the playoffs which every one of you wants to go first go.  And seen see there you go. It wasn't this one thing you say I want one of you I want both of you to convince me with the second toughest schedule in the league next year where this coming year how the Vikings are going to make the playoffs with basically the same team.  I don't know if I necessarily could but like it doesn't mean I'm not going to watch why didn't say anything about what I mean. I could tell you why you're going to tell me I'm wrong. I could give you some reasons. I just don't necessarily mean I believe they're going to be true but don't make things up. I'm not gonna make things up but you just said it's not I think their defense is better than you're giving them credit for I think they're at minimum a top-10 defense. There are very few defenses in the league that have the continuity. They do you're right the  defensive backs maybe aren't great. But they have one of the best defensive lines in the league. They keep Kendrick sambar who are really the linchpin of that defense and and the defensive staff is in place as well. You look on the offensive side of the ball and not even touch on Kirk Cousins because it's like who even can sort a know what is going to come out of him? You know, you could blame it on one thing the other he's going to be who he's going to be. Hopefully he can somehow make a step forward with a coordinator that maybe listens to him a little bit more. I don't think  I don't think Dean Philippa was ever going to work. I think he was more interested in promoting himself than anyone else and really doing what was best for the team and it goes to show I'm not sure stefanski is the answer. So I'm happy they brought in Kubiak. I think you give you know a guy with head coaching and coordinator experience to somebody who's been around a lot of different offenses. They can do a lot of creative things. We have one of the best receiving cores in the league Dalvin cook should hopefully be healthy this year if he can stay healthy. He's a more one of the more Dynamic backs in the league and you have  An offensive line, that won't be as awful as it's been it should be it should be average and I think you know, it's a it was a sad thing to kind of confront looking at last year but the offensive line with our weakness and and the coach unfortunately passed away before the year and I don't think you can Overlook that now you're right. We do have the second hardest schedule, but you know what? I think there's reasons to be optimistic. I think there's reasons to be positive, but I wouldn't I'm not going to sit here and tell you that I'd put every dollar I have on them.  In the playoffs, but I think I think you're understanding them a little bit. I think the NFL is at a point right now where defenses are at a pretty substantial disadvantage and I forget the brief part. I'm sorry when I say brief. No, I meant keep it brief. I may have forgot that go. Sam wasn't going to answer. So yeah, he's daring to go. He's eating it. He heard you ask the question and answer. I just didn't have an answer because the answer was I can't because well the I like my God wait Sam's a green with me.  Me. Yeah, I know. I'm not saying I like I'm going to convince you but you know, the I think you're I think you're underselling how good they are how how how much of a chance they have and they have an overrated last year, but they may be underrated this year because no one is expecting anything from I would agree with that but we have to lie wide receivers wide receivers only running back average Quarterback better offensive line still a pretty good defense. So well,  Silver chance we got when you set a lead that bring something up we got many many many more weeks or maybe at least two more to talk about the Vikings before we get canned but speaking of a lead. Is there any chance if luck you is going to be any better this year? Although definitely be better. They're not going to win the Big Ten. They'll be better.  This still barely get any recruits. I don't get it one four-star recruit. That's it. Because he's not a good recruiter. I think he is. I just I don't think there's a lot to really come play for in Minnesota. Like it's they're not they haven't been very good and it's cold and okay. I don't know but I think they'll be better. All right. Well, that's good. Here's what I will say that you want to talk about an elite receiving Corps. Those guys are going to be fun to watch if they can know God was gonna throw in the ball.  And it's a problem. They may not even they shouldn't even play with a quarterback. They should figure out which of those running backs can throw and play with three running backs in the backfield and and two or three wide receivers out there at all time sure we can make is running back. Yeah. I'm sure we can find another they should just place a slow and quarter white walk on quarterback that we could use you. I don't know there's no way that Seth Green is not the best quarterback on that roster and to put him with stand next to you intercepted them. I dropped it in all fairness. But are you bringing that up now? It's okay.  That's fair. It's a fair. It's a very not only did you drop it? You dropped it in the end zone. No. Oh, yes. It was like six you were standing in the end zone. You have jumped around the end zone. I was standing on the 10-yard line and had a free path to the end zone. Okay said I was that in the end zone and I dropped it. I will own up to it, but you don't have a choice. It's probably a video to somewhere. So it's maybe that might have been scrubbed from the I forgot how hot these earphones get and her house and the house God what dear honor  Something it's a good thing. I know I think they'll be better. I think they got they talk about quarterback issues. Oh, no, it's like you all right, but they'll be taught that team will be fun to watch because they'll have some high scoring games. Plus they got that they got the World's Strongest Man playing right tackle. Yes sixties what 712 he's like legitimately for Hive hundred that guy, huh? You said 712? Yeah. No, I think he's actually like six they listed at 7:12 Orleans.  Yeah, he's huge. Let's skip the twins till next time because there's going to be sold so many disappointments today been doing Isles Dynasty who the American League? Yeah, Dale won seven straight seat. Of course, that's why they had to get rid of the World Series Van Gogh and RBI, so we are talking to me.  Now, we're not all talking all star game. Do we even I mean wild what can you even say?  The often I like the Zuccarello signing. Well, yeah, how about Phil Kessel went to the school here and here he would rather go to Arizona to play hockey then here that's why pathetic. I mean Arizona is nice in the winter. Well not if you're they were pretty good last year after they weren't any they were better than we were well, yeah true, you know faith we would get any better though.  I don't know. Why you well, I don't have much faith in these still sucks. It's the same abilities in the same team.  I don't know this about a cup of coffee and this is it's probably not fair because it's the only way we're going to get them and it if we had made some better signings alongside, then we would have obviously been better. But the that Parisi Suitor dual contract is gonna  It's going to handcuff us that although unfreeze he's heard every year doesn't know and that and that some say it's not totally fair to say that because when they were when they first came if we would have just put some better players around them. We could have been a lot better. It's not their fault. But man that's a lot of money committed to a guys that are going to be pretty old pretty soon here, but maybe that makes us really bad and I think we've discussed before the worst thing you can do is be average especially in the NHL and that's what we are. We never bought them all so we never get a good draft pick we'd make  Stupid trades the trades that guy made like that for this Fenton guy is ridiculously bad doesn't mean he's just he's not great. I do like the Zuccarello signing. Yeah, he's good would have been nice to get castle or pavelski or one of those other guys, but as I think he's he was a good signing. I think he's Somebody went and I don't understand hookers our best player and they want to get rid of them. It's just ridiculous II agree with you. I don't get it. Um anything else you guys want to cover on our first show?  We'll get to the twins. There's so much stuff to talk about the twins will do we've already gone longer than we wanted to on our trailer teaser. We has my bedtime. Yeah Sam. It's got to get up early 1120 here. I I still got to put this thing together. I'm coming to New York on Friday, by the way. Oh, okay, and then I'm going to Broadway show. There's a song in there that makes me cry and wicked. What's it called? I can't remember. No, that's the name of the song. I can't remember. Oh,  Not just getting tonight. I can't I'm very excited. Look over you made. You know, the song you're going to be crying anything. Like this is the one they played it on. We've already been I feel like I've had I know I've had this I had this discussion on the sports tickets. So I don't really want to go down there was really adding a lot to the pockets not sorry for the new listeners. So I guess let's get used to this who the new blisters. Yeah, so we got all of our new we got our new same time as baseball family that's going to be listening.  We got the Santa Clara Broncos. Skip what was that? Let's go goes. It's Coco's. It's Coco's. It's Coco's. It's Coco's. What am I saying? That's our slogan at the last goal. Yeah drop the L skull and then codes for Broncos skull crows run. I'm probably that is that like a formal one or is that one that is that like employee of saxa wasn't that doors a formal one? That's always saying something inappropriate by the way. No, I was that's what I was  It's like that the poses I'm being set up that the equivalent of waste accident because I've I've I've personally taken it upon myself to make the formal the the formal chance or whatever. You want to call it of Georgetown vamos. Moya's no vamos ways. It just has such a better ring to it. I mean Julie Earth's alumni know, it's your Bronco. Yep. So is Brandi just a stage? Very cool. I knew I had Brandi Chastain. I did not know about coaches are truly hurts.  Volunteer assistant, um, so we need we need so in closing before we play our closing it up. We need your help.   But now that was something like a Telethon know this is a this is a phone lines are open. The phone lines are open call. 1-800 AP Tecna. We don't even have a fake number but this is an interactive show / podcast last what / whatever it really is. So once you listen to this for the first time, then you torque us tweet us Facebook us and Myspace us questions yams. What slide into the yams slide?  The annihilation say that I don't even know.

It's beginning of the the second chapter the sequel whatever you want to call. You know, what I heard. I don't know if that's what we call this episode the sequel. You know that I don't Guns and Roses. They originally we're going to their song was going to be welcome to the Orchard and they changed it to  into the jungle at the last minute.  Really? Did you hear that? No, Welcome to the Jungle does have a better ring to it though. So I get it it was going to be welcome to the orchard. But you know, it's often said this sequel is worse than the first one. Is that gonna be the case with this problem for our yes. Yeah. I forgot. We're on that path. Is this really a sequel or is this just a casual usage rights chapter 2 I guess it's pretty bad. I know that I'm going to name this episode chapter. I have like naming rights now. I've lot more power than I did last time. I think well, yeah, I think  I think when you do make your comments if the show is really bad keep immediately. Yeah, leave those ones out. Just the first one this after the second one. We can accept that. But I'd so now do you play the music or how I all more thing? I'm gonna wrap it up. I'm going to send it to you to wrap up and I will play the music and you wrap it up.

spotify:episode:0srqeti8Fgc7SlghshlGRl	Yeah.  Yes. Hi guys. Welcome to our more Legacy Academy set up. Our structure is basically in regarding to giving away free content of the soil that will decide as a company to start giving away a given our free content and the colonel a enable all the coaches and this is a basic content that we're giving out they can enable cultures that haven't got the education as we understand a lot of teams have parents just been given bags of balls and quick.  To go on coaching. They haven't they haven't got an understanding of the structure of what to use to implement the quality session with the kids. So today's topic is just going to be a structure of a basic the basic structure of the structure of a training session. OK this structure here. It's a it should be able to give you a goal line and how to give a quality session looking give our players better development part the part that they can enjoy their game a little bit more because it can see the progression of the game.  Obviously we're using the model that it will try to use it acknowledged as out there to give away to give out free information and trying to reach them as many people as we can wouldn't it in a modern day. We're all don't need to go to a cruel to go and coaching a club because that means what information is congested my internet my information can spread the way I wanted to spread. So we're going to use the model that we're going to use more than Legacy Academy and separate our brand and our football and sort of a brand and to give away free coaching sessions free coaching structures to  Chairs or teams that want to Avail to it. So we're going to start off with the the force be okay. So the content for today is going to be a training set up a basic training settle. This is the modern Legacy way. This is how we set up our training structure. Okay. Now this training structure can be used at any level at any team. Okay. All you just have to do is DM me if you can see that.  That clearly okay. Give us a DM send us a message give us a call and then we would move in with the send. You just content to your team that you can use it or if you want to hire as in for a few weeks to come in and do the structure which of Club weren't explore for five weeks. Depending on what your SWOT analysis is what your Club needs for us to come in and sort that out. Okay first you're going to start off with a basic setup.  The first thing would have come in obviously with my 18 years experience between playing and coaching and 18 years experience is something that someone can take away from you. So you got a lot of Knowledge from that, you know in between that I've got my you have to be doing Roses Don't You Ever Be lawyer says it's just to say that I have it and I get get mentored by an unbelievable coach has meant to me Rachel use them on obviously playing on the different managers and right you to use international and locally as really  He distracted me to the man that I am and so from the experience of with hearts. We normally like to start off the phone activities. Okay, so we should start off a little fun game whatever the game is so the game could be  A little cat and mouse game cut some noise gain depend on how young the kids are or else. It was a bit of a a bit and all the kids he can walk with head shoulder knees and towel and Cones which is basically head shoulder knees and in the pickup account that could be a writ of little fun game like that that you can get the kids. Tell them bonding. Let's just get them in the mail get them in the floor for a good session again. Obviously the kids are we coach have to understand this time to play on this time to actually focus on learning a few things. So I think once you have a good structure and  Kids understand that you have a good structure that you know exactly what you're talking about and they tend to kind of pick up information. They kinda tend to understand when you want them to come in to learn something and then let them do whatever they need to do. So, yeah, just a fun game head shoulder knees and girls can do the job. Okay, and then after that I normally have a 20 by 20 yards and 20 by 20 square and for the Rondo game. Okay. So this is a run though the $1 Lode Runner because the passing game or cable is not just passed as part.  Awesome move given an angle. So it's a full session for the kids. It's a for activity for the cage with an ordinary law is it is that they actually laying and how to pass a move in the game. Okay, but in a small area so long those a good one. Okay, and obviously when you're doing the Rondo's and put a little bit someone and maybe if the kids are any plans maybe give them to torture marks if the kids are not any pliers, maybe just give all in they can take as many pictures as account ones that slowly moving the ball quicker week by week it out and  The next be here is around for more Israel. Warm up is what we use are more than Legacy is what our usual all my any players and players all levels. It's worked for me. And that's why I'm a big big big big are pursued papacy work for coaches to use this and Atlantis from Kyle Gilligan. Okay, if you want to go check him out Kyle Gilligan kg Elite. This is the ramp warm up that he uses and I love this format, and I've been using it since then and I have as manuals or use them and love them.  The very function of the very efficient so and again this will happen the physical preparation for the kids. No matter what age they are and probably from around the age of five six open all the way to senior levels. You should try and start teaching them to understand around warm. Okay, because the younger we start this kids the better at least to become the better players they become so the ramp or more are the next R stands for race race is just getting the heart rate up a little jogs and it helped flicks little high knees.  Get that heart rate your and then after that activation boy the way I'm going to be doing a specific video to show you a demonstration of how to do a round form of in our next video. Okay, but this is just a taster of what the setup for look like. Okay. And then what I will do is I'll go back. I will do another content for you guys in the next few days showing you how to stage one stage two days. So I actually show you the implementation phase of how to do this warm up. Okay, so,  And the race is getting the heart with your activation is a couple activation stuff, maybe a couple of squats a couple of lunges with a spinal rotation. Like I said again, I'll get the video out here on how to do those morbid Mobility mobilization again the same thing, you know, getting the tea spinal rotation getting the hamstring moving getting your glute activation and then potentiate potentially just literally means you go for 50% 75% a hundred percent. So those kind of Little M. You know, the potential is probably the most important part.  Your heart rate should be up to maximum to training training potentiated potential. So basically that means potential potential means for someone comes to your 50s or the springtime 50% Then they Sprint at 75% in the script out of the maximum was suspended on maximum then you know the right train. Okay. So once they do that, they give them two minutes off to get some drink going to get some water on and then we get into the technical part of the session. So normally from the ramp one more. I normally like to go into the technical phases. Okay, so the technical things  He is the pastor of the dribbling the won't be worn. Okay. So again, I'm going to do a video to that. Okay, we'll do a little video about that during the week maybe next week, but you will see a Content coming out every week on different model on different exercises that we do in our module. Okay. So that's the technical phase is typical phrases can be a passing through can be a dribbling drill or to be a worthy One Drug could be a ball protection drill can be yeah anything that in regarding technical  Of take the part of the game depending on what your team needs. Okay, and then The Possession game The Possession game with some technical implementation. So what obviously we're doing our own home and we're gonna race I went straight to technical. Normally. I would have a physical here.  Okay, so normally I would have a physical session here. So my physical sexual normally with the kids which I will and I will show you guys a video about and so normally I go for physical technical a little bit of tactical and then a match on the end. Okay, so physical technical tactical plan a little bit of much. So for the physical part of it, we normally do so condition and stuff and actually do that without the ball sometimes depending on the quality of the players and the technical phase of relief. We just spoke about then The Possession game is in relation to the tactic.  Implementation so The Possession game will incorporate encourage players to be in the same positions depend on how we want to play the weekend or what you want the kids to be able to implement in the games. So The Possession game always have some tactical references or if you want. If you don't want to call it the references you want to call it football understand the references. Okay. So that always comes into the game and Let the Fire Die behind of a small side of games for every five six three six loads of games.  Loads and loads of goes get the kids moving making sure the swallows are goals and they come to finish a game this part of where the number six they are. So there's seven steps to seven steps to more Legacy training structure. The last phase of it is the one of the most important part of it that you don't want to finish in your session in a chili. Chili Latina in a chill just chilling out kind of having a better just not interested kind of game you want to make sure the game has a good time for the Finish heart of the finishing sessions buzzing to the fish sessions.  No ask because because the temple can be depend on the level. So again if they're low level players and want to bring them to the next level you want to make sure you're pushing to the best. They can be always make sure the players you get the best applies that they can push them to become the better player. You can be and for number one thing is obviously believe in your players believing in your structure believing in what you do. So, this is a little boy line of our of our end.  Basic basic coaching structure going. Okay, and what I'll do is I'll not let you know the base part of it. You can write this down. If you want to write it down. It can watch the video as much as you can and the content will be put out on all that crap on our platforms or Instagram or Facebook and it's going to be on Spotify as well and then on YouTube as well. So and you can reward you can re-watch this this session again, and if you're missing our anything and then  Yeah, and there step by step. The next one. We'll do. Next is the next time we'll come back in again. I'm going to get a player we suffer the player will go to the fundamentals. Okay, so we go through videos actually showing you how to implement this in your session for are thank you so much again for watching. It's a free platform. So I'm going to give you free information and then obviously you can use as a coach in your team's if you can't do it. You can hire a Zen you can get us in for a few weeks. You can come in for a few weeks. We structure your Club restructure.  Team of the let you carry on water for the rest of your coaching career. So thank you so much for watching again, and hopefully our experience is right you my 18 years of playing and coaching. Hopefully can be able to inspire somebody in sport a coach there only one coach. I need to inspire and my job is done because that one coach can make one or two players getting spoiled as well. So thanks for watching. Keep an eye on all I am El Amor De Legacy platforms. Keep an eye of cheating in a row, obviously what we got coming out and then have a great day. Thanks for that.  that  thanks Ali.	In this episode we talk about how we set up a quality training session for our players.  This is a basic structure that can be used at any level at any club and can be adapted to suit any team.

Welcome back in another edition of the college football news podcast mix-up pow ski with you. Keep you check out for this one, but I welcome it now from a man. You've read his work you've seen as by lines on college football news Pro Football Weekly various different places inside the pile on pile on you podcast. You've heard him host before Jeff are kind enough to join me for a few minutes tonight on the college football news podcast. What's up, Jeff? Nick, man. Good talk. Good to talk to you.  College football is within our within our sights. Yeah. I know it. It's like you wait all offseason. You wait all summer. And finally it's like alright, the day count is down to single digits were about to Miami or about to Florida have that to kick things off and be the be our counterpart for the rest of the summer into the fall, but I guess the the conversation starts when you bring up college football anymore and it's like the NBA was four years with the Warriors in the Cavs is it is simple to you to the numbers play out from everything.  You've seen that it's Clemson, it's Bama or it's Bama. It's Clemson. It's a gap than Georgia and a gap and everyone else my first reaction this season following especially Following last season was I'm ready for Alabama to run roughshod over everyone. I think it's going to be a revenge tour that we've never seen before not that they need more motivation other than just having really good players. I think being being handled on the national stage as they were last year my number.  Something looking looking out. This year is is is Bama is not it's not will Clemson rebound. Are they the new Alabama but I think Alabama is ready to just run through everybody Clemson is typically lost. I think last year was unique that through the Brent venables the era they've typically lost a lot of defensive players last year. They returned a lot for the really the first time. I think they've gone a few years where they lost at least half of the guys in their defense and still being good. So this year, I mean, I'm still  expecting that but their top players all across the board now, I mean, you lost your dad we talked about feral and Wilkins and Mitch Hyatt a lot of leadership on that Squad and you know, Trevor Lawrence probably the best quarterback in the country, but where is that other piece going to come from for Clemson? So that's how I look at it right now, especially with those two teams. I do think there are a number of teams down below them that are talented enough to have it to me to have a shot, but it would be really tough.  I was putting any money on either and any team this year to go against either Clemson our Bama. Yeah, look at it in Clemson. I do have a little bit of concern just because how much of that defensive line. You've seen stars go year after year after year with them, but just the this year. It's like well, it's a collective whole holy cow. Like that's a ton of NFL Talent. They lose. I just don't look at their schedule and who's supposed to scare me? Like I honestly do not have an answer on that like who is Spike Texas A&M is an interesting game early on but there's no reason they  A shouldn't just run rampant over the rest of the ACC South. Carolina's not going to give them a scare. It's gonna be a team that's 13 and oh again, come college football playoff. And then it's them against Bama them against Georgia them against whoever and there's no reason or not one of the two or three best teams in the country. I mean the Georgia Tech opening game is going to be pretty pretty rough for for the Yellowjackets just because they're changing schemes, but I think I am I'm you saw a tough and I'm played them last year at home granted. It was at it was a tan.  But you saw a tough. They played them last year. I think this am team will be better than they were last year. This comes into your baby a little were so catching them early and you go at Syracuse the next week and two years ago. They lost in the dome and the Carrier Dome. So that's a tough early game, especially with the experience Syracuse team coming back. Yeah me the rest of the schedule. Isn't that rough? It's really those those games early on because the rest of the time they get BC at home. I like BC but getting them at home. I don't think that's gonna be a tough one, Florida State at home again.  Florida State Should bounce back and play better, but I don't see them giving us here. So it's really those the game 2 and Game 3 and passed that it really goes to is Clemson could be tested enough during the regular season to be ready to play those tougher teams and leagues is the playoff this year.  Get to the playoffs this year. I'm really saying when yeah, I mean, I think it's pretty much to me. It's a when it's a game of one like I don't see like Syracuse to change the quarterback. I hate I'm not as thrilled with Syracuse this year. I was surprised when they're first number came out. It was like a five and a half wind totally got bed all the way up to like eight eight and a half. I'm not as big on Syracuse this year that Texas A&M game I think is going to be one of the better games this season, especially non-conference games for the year, but I just don't see something in the ACC. It's Clemson. It's a huge gap and it's a lot of question marks.  After that, one of the things I think is interesting though is looking at the rest of the SEC and the talent obviously speaks for itself. Like how close for you is LSU to Bama or Florida to Georgia because I think it's it's almost like you view that conference right now is the rest of college football views Clemson versus Bama. It's a countdown until it's Bama in Georgia in Atlanta. I mean, how real is a threat from Florida? How real is a threat from anyone else in the West for?  For Alabama this year. Yeah, fuck bam in the Tier 1 by themselves, but I would group LSU Georgia and Florida together in that next tier. I mean Florida's offensive line is it might be an issue LSU's defense is going to be a killer. I mean that's that's a squad right there with and with Delta with Fulton with morons where you're going to have a ton of guys that are going to see on Sundays that are going to be a problem. It's just whether or not Joe burrow can continue what he did last year and that's always been the question with Alice. You are going to get a play making out of the quarterback position.  Offense but I do I do like LSU a lot this year Georgia. I mean Jacob from has got to play a little better. They're going to have they're going to have a good offensive line. They're going to be under a Swift and Beatrice Robinson. And then that defense are always gonna have guys coming out with a recruiting classes that they've been putting out and the Florida. I mean Philippe Franks has got to play the way he's supposed to play. I think the way they expect him to play in Florida. So I would put those teams on one tier and I know off are we talked a little bit of Mississippi State and I was  as you see some of the numbers behind them this year and we know another year or more heads offense Kyle and Hills a playmaker for them did lose a lot in Abram and Montez sweat and Jeff Simmons on defense, but I do think Mississippi state is another squad on that maybe a third tier with am right now and I am going to be coming up. I mean am look really good on the national stage a few times last year and I think Jimbo's going to have them playing. Well, I'm it's hard to look at Bama in the same group as any of these guys right now, but I do think there are a number of teams in the SEC that  People scare this year. Yeah the Ingham thing. It's you look at their schedule and it's Clemson ridiculous. And then there yeah, Texas State and Lamar out of conference, but they're at LSU there at Georgia this year, Mississippi State on the schedule Auburn on the schedule. It's like there's no slouches for them. That's got to be amongst. If not the toughest schedule for any team in the entire country. This season is going to be tough again to Auburn. This is not and I guess this is kind of the not to not to draw comparisons across  Sports but you know, how is old gets his team ready in the regular season for for the tournament. I mean this is their ready every year for the playoffs because they do play a tough schedule. They've got a cupcake sprinkled here or there but they didn't shy away two years ago and they play Florida stay in the nest in the first game of the season on a neutral field of said, let's go they roll the ball out and they took care of business. So that's bad is never a concern with me for dammit. I never look at scheduled bam. I look at the squad they have coming back. And right now you're looking at them having the probably the  Most talented quarterback date had under saving the most talented most talented receiving Corps. They've had their to save and another awesome running back and Nagi Harris who finally get his share of the carries and then a ton of guys on defense. So bam is going to be trouble and schedule really doesn't matter. You mentioned the quarterback to Otunga Viola. I always have arguments with Pete teams, like everything that we start talking about. He's more of a to a guy. I think the Trevor Lawrence is the best quarterback in college football. I think he's going to be the most decorated college football player by the time  he goes to the draft a couple years from now and I think he's going to probably lead them to another National Championship in the next two seasons and he's gonna be as decorated as anyone probably since Tim Tebow that we've seen you have to take one of those for their NFL careers from what you've seen so far. Which one do we are you Takin Trevor Lawrence turtle or throats out. See I wish people is here because he just I don't see it. I don't see it as much Pete. Hope you download this and listen to this. I don't know how you can not see it. I'm  I like to but when I'm looking at guys within the lens of and maybe this is a personal preference thing to neck is I look at guys like Justin Herbert even about above to and that's just we're looking at you know arm strength. We're looking at me. He's we're looking at build. I mean we try not to because there's been people that have succeeded at the NFL level with a not typical build and people reference Drew Brees people reference Russell Wilson, but more times than not  it's people built like Trevor Lawrence that succeeded the NFL level and you see him. I mean God zip the ball. I mean, he's throwing he's throwing out patterns across the field on a I mean just zip it in there and to it listen to his made a lot of plays to a can keep plays alive. He's heavy. He's smart. He's tough and he's got he's got a ton of skills and he's going to be a first round pick, but if you're asked me one of those guys Trevor Lawrence with a bullet. Yeah could not agree with you more and I can just hope that our guy Pete Feud.  Is listening to this and shaking his head and disagreeing somewhere far away. Something is a look at nationally here obviously have to bring up the Big Ten that's against that's local for both of us. Are you buying the Michigan hype not until they actually do something right in the time that the time they had to do it was when they had was the peppers team two years ago. That was the squad. I had pushed all my chips in on I was like, these guys are make the playoffs. This is the team that's going to do it and  You know, I get another lost Ohio State. So that was by far the most talented team. They've had under Harbaugh and with all the losses on defense this year, you know, Devin Bush and when a bitch and I mean she Patterson didn't really show me much last year. I just I'm kind of like in a wait-and-see mode with them. I'm going to say they're not going to do it until they actually do it.  It's where I'm at with it too. It's just I get it. They don't lose games. They're not supposed to lose and there is something to be said for that but they don't beat tell me when Jim Harbaugh has beaten a team at Michigan that has anywhere near as much talent as him.  But it hasn't happened yet. Right and it's like I just look at it and it's okay like in that schedule is yeah, they get Notre Dame at home. You have to get Ohio State at home like that Wisconsin game. They have to travel to Wisconsin. That's not going to be easy to Penn State and Penn State's kind of in a rebuild type of season going on with them. But you get Penn State middle towards the end of the year like that's gonna be a different team than it is going to be like if you were playing them in September or late September and I think that's kind of where I just look at Michigan team and until they actually show me.  Can't get on board with it. So that mean you're full on board with Ohio State because I threw one by Pete who I think's going to win the Big Ten and it wasn't either one of those is it was at Ohio State for you, then that you're still fully on board with when in the Big Ten I was looking if I was looking to Futures that's for Michigan State. Thank you. Call me crazy. I didn't realize that with you. But yeah, that's what I told Pete the other day and he did you really like I had three heads. I told him like when you have the best defense in the conference, I don't think that's much of a question. Maybe the you can look at Ohio State and Sarah.  Has more on a felt Allen on their defense, there's not a better defensive unit the Michigan State in this conference and tell me which coach in the Big Ten you take over dantonio because I don't think there is one and now that's not to say that Ryan Day can't turn into that. He's not that yet. It's you mix the best events with the best coach in offense that I just don't think can be anywhere near as bad as it was last year not to say it's gonna be anything special and I'll take my ten to one twelve to one chances on that.  And if you remember before last season which Big Ten quarterback in a me a big-time quarterback that was getting more love than Brian low working.  There wasn't many know if any and then he was banged up all last year. He was not healthy at any point during last season if he's healthy now. That's a team that is it 17 starters back. Dantonio typically has that team play better than the talent on the field on the talent. They have at the beginning of year. They always they always outplay their talent and that's a team that I often look to from looking for a team to exceed expectations. You know, I look at Iowa is it seems like every other year I  Has a good year or they and then they go down and they go back up. They go down a little bit always kind of hovering around 9 and 3 6 & 6 but with Michigan State before that 2016 kind of blip on the radar last year. They definitely underplayed but aside from that they've constantly out performed and like you said, this is the best events of the Big Ten. Maybe not the most talented but the best unit in the Big Ten and then if it will work, he is healthy. They're going to be a problem and Michigan  They're not afraid to play Michigan at in Ann Arbor. No not whatsoever. And yes, they have to go to Ohio State. They have to go to Wisconsin and back-to-back weeks. I'm not saying they're going to run the table in the Big Ten, but I think they have plenty of talent. They have a pain in the ass defense that's going to I feel like knock one of these teams off if not two of them and all of a sudden they're right there in the running. And when this whole thing that's been made all offseason of owes us to your Ohio State finally Falls to Michigan. Can the Wolverine trying to get by like, Michigan.  Not being only the best team in their own damn State let alone their own division or conference. I I'm I don't I look at Michigan State and I just think that's the formula of if you want success that that is that's what you're looking at. And that's a team that I think is going to surprise and turn a lot of heads this season looking out a little bit more nationally Big 12 wise Oklahoma second year in a row. They replace the first overall pick in the Heisman Trophy winner. How much is the fall off there? Because it's not just that it's an offensive line that losses for starters as well. Is is this  Like finally the time that Lincoln Riley gets to deal with the the tough like overhaul of a roster college football wise or is it just a machine that just kind of reloads and keeps going for them. I think of that conference, especially when you eat do have if you have a talent at quarterback and that Lincoln Riley offense and as much as Jalen hurts, his Moline during his time in bama, he's a talent and he's a he's a highly rated recruit for a reason he put up numbers for a reason. I think he's going to be I think they're going to be just fine CD lamb are  I believe the biggest play maker in the country on the outside. They're stacked at tailback. They create Humphreys. Maybe the best player in the Big 12 in the office of why that's Center. They have replacing everybody else. But they've done that before they Oklahoma gets guys. That's that's not what they're framed offensively defensive never really their calling card. It's it hasn't been for quite some time since early in the Stoops era, but they're going to put up points and they're going to that's in Big 12 team that puts up.  Most points off as most successful and I don't see anyone that schedule right now outside of I mean people are blown up Texas. It almost seems like the Texas train came a year early and now everyone's jumping on board maybe a little too. Maybe they come back to earth a little bit this year. But TCU is the team I think in the Big 12, that is get maybe the give Oklahoma some problems. That's that's the squad I'm looking at right now that could give them as problems. Okay? Why do you like to see you so much because I have somebody else in the Big 12 that I am very high on. It's one of the it's the coaching Trust.  With Patterson and it's they often, you know, they've had at least 11 wins and three of The Last Five Years. They've got got 12 starters back which isn't isn't a lot but again, like I said see the lamb before Jalen reger's maybe 1A or 1B to him in this first Playmakers in the in the conference and they to experience its experienced team. They've been through the ringer Patterson is the best is my estimation the best overall coach of the Big 12 and a lot of times if there's  have some tea my sort of like sort of don't like I lean toward the coach and there's no one really on that TCU schedule that I could see them at. It's the at Oklahoma game, but again jumps out to me and I don't know. I don't know why this year when I look at the big 12, it's really just Oklahoman TCU then I'm looking at yeah, Texas is going to be good. But I do expect them to take a little bit of a step back from their from their last season who's the team that you're looking at like I like Iowa State are you? Okay, you mentioned the coaching part of it and I common trend for me to that's why I like Michigan State so much is largely because of their coach, but I look at Iowa State.  Ensure you have to replace in all World running back last year in Montgomery, but you had probably the best freshman quarterback. That wasn't named Trevor Lawrence in the entire country year experience with him. You get T. See you at home you get Texas at home for that team. I think that that's one that Matt Campbell right now. I expect him to be in the NFL before too long and a Lincoln Riley's name is always the one of the big 12 that gets thrown out there. Like I look at Campbell is a guy that's going to be coaching on an NFL sideline before long if he wants to if not that he's going to go to a  Big-time college program that's not names Iowa, and I kind of combined all of that a favorable schedule and I look at that as a team that's has a damn good shot to be played in the Big 12 championship and they've got the best front seven in the conference. They either offensive line and returns all five starters and they've got the best front seven of Defense the conference micros ji Quan Bailey two guys that are going to be are going to be hopefully more known this season is to go through I like Iowa State a lot too and I agree with you on Campbell. I mean that guy is guy's a star and he's going to be a bigger job sooner than later.  Yeah, that's the part that I see on it. And it's also they get Iowa at home. Not that that's important for for in terms of deciding the Big 12, but at least in terms of a rivalry game and a game that's going to give them a little bit more a little bit more exposure and they beat Iowa early on I just kind of going through conferences here Pac-12 when you look at that in terms of talent, they haven't won a big game out of conference. I don't know the last one probably last time Stanford beat Notre Dame. I can probably be the last one that's considered but about right. Yeah, I  It just seems like it's few and far between when they get a marquee win against an out of conference opponent organ takes on Auburn this year, otherwise chances. There aren't a whole heck of a lot of them. How does it work in stack up against Auburn and how does this conference kind of Stack up to the rest of the power fives? I mean for getting it seems like there's a lot of people on the end organs bandwagon this year two to one of the favored they return 17 starters. I mean Justin Herbert to the how you want to look at a when he would have been your first quarterback had he gone  Have you gone out this year? We have been your first quarterback had he gone out to the draft. Yes.  Yeah, and that's based on I mean it's a lot of its based on projection because those people point to his completion percentage and say he hasn't completed up passes for me is not as consistent as you like. I just think he has the look of a guy that and you dig in because you didn't do the extensive NFL work on emerged as extensive film work on them because he didn't come out but he's a guy that consistently made plays outside the pocket inside the pocket. He's playing in front of her and back of one of the best offensive lines in the country. So that gives him a little clearance but  Yeah, you made plays and he's he has the look of a quarterback and has the has the tools of the quarterback that I like. So yeah, he would have been the number one guy. I would have taken this year and that offensive line is something special maybe the best offensive line of the country. Troy die die on defense has a star at linebacker. They have Playmakers in this outside. Although I'm still waiting for jajuan Johnson the transfer for Penn State to make a play. It seems like people have been talking about him for three years and he still has done anything, so waiting on that to happen, but if there's  As a team and I don't know how you feel about this. But if there's a team that I'm looking to make a move in the Pac-12 this year, it's Utah if Tyler Huntley is healthy at quarterback. I think that's the team with the best best front for one of the best front force in the country. And the Jaylen Johnson who I expect to be a first round pick a corner next year. I think that's a team that is going to be in Kyle Whittingham again, we go back to the coaching thing. It's just a trusted coach a guy that gets the most out of his team's so I like Utah and that conference, but other than that, I mean,  Looking for USC to rebound Washington loses a jake Browning for the first time in six years. He's not gonna be starting quarterback for them. And then Stanford is always pretty good under Shaw Washington State loses Minshew a quarterback. So still a lot of unknowns. No one's really solidified themselves at the as the consistent presence and the presence in that conference. You know is Colorado one of these teams under Mel Tucker that's going to make a comeback, you know, her men were just still trying to do something Arizona State, but you toss the squad that I'm looking at this here to possibly do some that the Pac-12 so I don't know.  I don't know how you're looking at that but I that's that's the team that I would be picking if anyone is going to come out of there and go to the playoff. I'd be looking at Utah. Yeah, I think Utah is probably should I put this I don't want to say safe pick. I mean, you're the Utah Utes, but it's kind of playing in the south is favorable to them. Last year was such a weird year because quarterback gets hurt. They had who else got hurt for them last year. I'm trying to remember the running back no running back. Yeah. They both go down. You think their season is over and all of a sudden they take off and up winning the South their offense is depleted by  Have to get to the conference Championship in one of the uglier Conference Championship Games. You'll see they still went down to the wire against Washington in that game. Then they blew a big lead against Northwestern and their bowl game. So it's one of those of like, it feels like last year was a nice pleasant surprise for them, but I don't I don't think that they're I think Oregon or Washington one of those teams has the potential to be the best team. However, they also play with you know, beating up on each other in playing in the same division. And by the time you get to the  conference Championship Game those guys could simply be playing for a Rose Bowl berth when Utah would have a potential Spot Shot at the playoffs on the line that yeah, if there's a team that I think would be able to earn a spot to the playoffs based off of schedule based off of where they'd be sitting entering Conference Championship weekend. I think I agree with you on it being Utah. I don't know if I buy them being the best team. I think that there's more Talent than one Washington and organs rosters if that makes any sense a little bit. I agree with you there because a lot of my a lot of my picking, Utah.  Is the coach factor in the The Experience factor that because I think there's a lot built into that Utah program with crystal ball in his second year at Oregon. Just so kind of waiting to see what is he going to what is he going to solidify their for the Ducks? But if you're looking at the team with the best quarterback in the best Playmakers and the best offensive line now, I'm just kind of selling Oregon for a person that didn't even take or again. I'm going to sell the organ for you, but that'd be that's that's a good selection in Washington is going to be interesting because I think Chris Peterson has  I think he's he's kind of got that program where they could they'd is this the year. This will be the test here. Is this a program now where you know, they're going to be good here. And you're out they they have been consistently bringing in guys bring it in guys. And I think this is the first year without browning without Gaskin, you know, a lot of that a lot of the face of that Squad is gone now and I know they I know because of injury They're bringing back the bring back Tre Adams on the offensive line. Aaron for is a  Budweiser receiver and absolute stud a wide receiver, but you know there it's the test here for Washington. I really want to see what happens with them. I'm very curious because I was a huge fan of them. I know we pick them much higher than they were when they made the playoffs in 16. I know we pinpointed them as a team to watch that year. They played outstanding but I think what's interesting is again if we're talking about coaches with with him and Whittingham and who else dantonio me and there's a lot of guys that because of their body of work.  They have garnered more trust in people that watch college football as far as when you're making progress prognostications for the year. Yeah, and it's you always expect him to get better and improve his a year goes on and it's always feels like a safe bet it's absurd that like you look at Utah and now they're packed fall for a good decade or so now so it has a different feel but like this was little old Utah 15 years ago when Whittingham took over for for a guy named Urban Meyer like oh, yeah, the old talks about maybe you talking crash the BCS. Urban Meyer got him to do that. That's like  Well, maybe they win one of these games against the big time team and Whittingham got them to do that. They beat Alabama in the Sugar Bowl the one you're all of a sudden. It's like it's a Pac-12 team and you're realistically looking at it before the year of like wouldn't be that huge of an upset of the Utah Utes earn a college football playoff. It's just it's insane of like little Utah has come and turned into this and it's just it's kind of weird of looking back of what Utah Sports words. Like I was Michael doleac and Keith Van Horn steam that wasn't a football program whatsoever when I was growing up and now it's all of a  in this there. Anyway, Rick Majerus. Yeah, Rick Majerus in is sweater. And yeah, I still look at the Utah. I look at in the Council of previews. I turned like the Mountain West and so expect see Utah there same way. Like my dad always when I was growing up. He would always call Memphis. Memphis State is a huge college basketball fan and I all Memphis State this Memphis State. They're like that. It's Memphis. There's no State on the end. He wouldn't understand. I'm same way the Utah. I was like, oh, yeah, they are in the Pac-12. Oh, yeah Colorado's in  At 12:00 to 1:00 the hell did that happen? Oh my goodness. Look at that. It non-power five teams. Notre Dame is is a team that I think the program is in better shape than it was a season ago at least entering the year, but the way that the roster kind of breaks down the way they have holes. I don't have good things for the Fighting Irish happening in Georgia and kind of being out of the playoff by then outside of that any other of the non power five teams have a chance at knocking on the door making things interesting and  Causing chaos for the for the final four for the college football playoff to you me eyes. Always I think the first power 5 T my eyes always drift toward when they're looking at previews for the seasons Boise State and that just shows you kind of the name brand that they've solidified in college football more Notre Dame. I'm the same way as you and I know we can I'm an ordained fan. So I will say that I often look in that look at them more negatively than I probably should but I do  You see them taking a bit of a step back this year and part of that is part of that is reality and part of that is being an ordained fan. You're kind of waiting for the fall back the next year that we really haven't been able string many seasons together that are consistently really really good. I think last year in the year before was really the first time that's happened in quite some time. I do think Ian books going to be good still some question that all of the wine is good every year but Kareem and aqua or possibly the best defensive end combo the country but Cody and tranquil  and Julian love and those are in Jerry Tillery up the middle. I mean those are huge losses and there's a lot of guys behind them that haven't seen much action because those guys played so much football. So a lot of questions there, but if there's one team and I think outside the power 5 that I'm looking at the possibly make some noise and people will point to Central Florida. But again, let me go back to this area for Brandon wimbush is at quarterback. I've got some questions with you, but throwing this thing becomes an issue. Yeah Cincinnati's the  That I'm looking at this year and I know Luke fickle and he'll be in his third year this year adam-11 to last year be Virginia Tech in the bowl game returning 14 starters. Dozen Ritter a quarterback is going to be a star maybe, you know potentially in like Lamar Jackson conversation coming up as a dual threat Michael Warren at tailback. Their defense is lights out led by James Wiggins at safety. A lot of guys that we're going to that we're going to hear about in the future and they're still pretty young to I think a lot of these guys will go back far enough.  Other your next year, so the Cincinnati team is not just going to be a problem this year, but Luke Vehicles got them pretty well set up in that American Conference for the future. They go to Ohio we to but other than that, I don't see I don't see a game at Memphis. The last Friday of the season is one of those underrated games of the year. I think that if both those teams are as good as they're supposed to be and that this is supposed to be good again. I think that's going to be a fantastic game to finish off the conference season before heading to the conference Championship games, but I  Today's a team. I could easily see in a going undefeated in conference into that. Memphis game the last game of the year and maybe have a again the problem though is with your if you're a non power find School most likely need an undefeated record going to get head into the playoff or make some noise in the playoff. If you're playing at Ohio State that second week of the season. I don't know if that's gonna work out so well for you, but Cincinnati's a team. I not only like for this year, but think pickles got the talent that program on the up and up and I look for big things.  For them in the next couple of years how long you think fickle lesser absolutely depends on what jobs open up. I mean, it's been a launching pad of late Tennessee to really have from their Notre Dame jobs come from they're fickle. Obviously the Ohio State ties doesn't seem like that's going to be open anytime soon. But like that has just been a launching pad to Big Time like and it's interesting too because seeing is that fickle it had that time at Ohio State has to help. Both of fire was out. Does he kind of look at it differently? He's had the taste of the big time as he went on maybe.  Hopefully this little morning still young guy very young. That'll have you turned 40 yet. But I wonder if he's going to be more patient seeing as how it was at Ohio State and it wasn't very successful. I believe they went six and six years there, but it's going to be interesting because I hope and a lot of times I really hope some of these you see this in college basketball team college football some of these guys that see success in one or two years will jump at the first power 5 school first powerful.  Good job that comes up form and you can understand it in some respects because it's a huge payday and they may not you never know. What happens the next year. So you got to take what you have. There are other people that slow played a little bit more and then they fall into the the good job and there's a really really good job at top Tier 1 they build up more of a resume. So I don't know about fickle. It's just interesting because I think he's seen how it is on the other side and maybe we'll take a different approach to it Jeff. Appreciate you taking the time. It's been a lot of fun. You told us earlier. It's bamas.  The rest of everyone is just kind of living in at this football season. What's your biggest surprise? You see coming here in 2019. Oh baby, I would say horrible gets fired surprise anymore. I mean I think fired would be a surprise. I think underachieve. I I'm with you. I think that that is I think under achieve that team has it written all over themselves. There's all this talk of oh my God shape Patterson, it's office. If it's some butter. It's a third offense in three different his last three years playing football. Like that's an  Use for NFL quarterbacks, but now it's going to be the Difference Maker for him at the Collegiate level. I think this is a team. They lost a lot of NFL Talent by the way, like I think this has regression written all over it and big-time disappointment in Arbor. Well, how about, how about Iowa's Iowa Michigan State in the Big Ten championship game sign me up for that. What year was that? Like twenty thirteen or fourteen where it was just the pounded out like 14 to 10. Come back, Michigan State win, sign me up one of those. I know that the Big 12 thing.  Exciting and I know that the SEC is putting up points more and more. I'm good for one of those every once in a while. I think the West is going to be a lot better this year talent-wise. I mean, I think Minnesota is better. I think produce better. I think Nebraska is going to be better. I think that's and northwestern's got the best quarterback they've ever had at the school. So other than what's not talk about Illinois, but I think the rest of that I think the rest of that division is going to be so much better than we've seen and yeah they may they may knock each other around a bit, but the tent not just  The one the one loss record hasn't been the problem that division. It's been the talent. They haven't had teams that you look at and go that team can beat anybody. I think this year. You're going to see the Big Ten West you're going to see a bit of a Resurgence as far as the talent goes in that cop and that division. Yeah. I know that Illinois is seen as a step behind everyone else there. But how close is it 1 through 6 with the other six teams there for you E. I mean, this is like you could take a dart and just throw it in. Okay. Yep. Nebraska is going to finish first, Iowa second and Minnesota third and it wouldn't surprise anyone you.  Tell me the Big Ten West could have any I would be most the only one I really be truly out of out of my shoes surprise for would be Illinois. The rest of my could see potentially going to the conference Championship game. I mean, this is probably going to be maybe maybe the weakest Wisconsin team. We've seen in quite some time. I mean Jonathan Taylor obviously still there, but you're breaking new quarterback tongue gone on defense, but they're mean they're consistently good the rest of the team Brahms got Purdue going Flex.  Got Minnesota back. I think that it's always come back with a ton this year. Northwestern's all those is always going to Northwestern but Illinois this is supposed to be this year is supposed to be the year. They're competing for a bowl this coming season. So it's kind of put up or shut up time for them.  How are you with the state of the line, you're in Illini guy, like stated them state of the lobby thing state of the rebuild. If you want to call it that like, where are you at with you later? I mean fandom included and just casually just frustration just I think people need to look at it realistically and I think loves was a play. I think it would have been different if love you come to Illinois right after he he was at the Bears. I think that's a different draw. I don't know how many of these kids are really  drawn to Illinois. Bye Lovie Smith. I was a fan of the higher just because it was doing something different. It wasn't it wasn't a real. It wasn't one of the first time they were interesting ever and that's the team went to the Rose Bowl was look I know in my life, but they were never even interesting. It's like love you at least brought that but it quickly wore off. I was on campus the day that they hired him and for for a work thing and I had to go into a meeting for a couple hours. I came out and the campus was plastered and Lovie Smith stuff and I had never seen anything like that with them only, Illinois.  Ball probably since the sugar bowl or that starts at the Rose Bowl, but this is this is they've got enough Talent on that team but schematically and strategically during games throughout the last three years. They just have looked they've been lacking and with the number the number of players you've seen move out of the program MJ Rivers this year, Isaiah Williams is gonna be a freshman quarterback Reggie. Corbin is going to be a stud stud again at tailback.  Offensive lines pretty good, but a lot of these guys have been this will be the third year that they're seeing significant playing time for innate last season. It's not crazy to me to see a two-game Improvement. It's not the Ohio State's not on their schedule. So that's a plus they do play Michigan, Michigan State, Wisconsin and Iowa, but getting six wins anymore is not a huge fan and I would I wouldn't be surprised to get to six wins. I would be shocked if they won the division.  Awesome. Well appreciate you taking the time Jeff. This was a ton of fun.

Welcome to the inaugural episode of the Fortnight drop-in pod cast. I'm your host Dennis joined by my fellow partner in crime and brother a loaf. Hello feather fellow Bots  Yes, we're world-renowned on the Fortnight universe as Bots because evidently we're not good this podcast is going to be a kind of a focus look at Fortnight as far as the Esports scene and just our general take on what's developing and the Fortnight Universe which is of we all know it's changing daily.  Yeah, this podcast will focus on the week 3 World Cup semis specifically the Northeast region solos Edition today is the start of the week for Duo's. We will cover that in a later podcast.  Yeah, and just kind of our general experience with Fortnight. I dabbled in Fortnight. Probably about a year ago when it when I doubt when I found out it was going to be released for the Nintendo switch, which is my primary gaming platform. I then installed Fortnight on my PC to see what all the hype was about and realize that keyboard and mouse controls are not for me.  But I want to download it a switch. I got the bug and I've been hooked ever since.  Yeah, it took me awhile for the bug to catch on with me. My brothers were playing with it. We kind of play as a group on the switch. Then I took about a three-month break and then Dennis told me that we would the they had zombies in the game in October and then shortly after that they had started adding golf cart. So I played with the golf carts for a little bit then a few weeks later. They had a planes and so I was just  Egg to play with the planes and I gradually started playing more and more and started getting a little bit better at building. I'm still I would say I'm post novice but I'm not quick enough to be called like a good Builder. Like I'm somewhat decent at it and that's what separates that's how you get the skill Gap in Fortnight, which makes it really addicting is it's the building because everybody can kind of figure out how to shoot people and there's a wide range of guns and loud as you can do and have some success was  I'm dating but the biggest part is getting The High Ground rotations 90 degree rotations and sneaking up on people and surviving surviving is a big part of it. So, yeah, it's yeah, the eliminations isn't necessarily the way to go. I mean there are aggressive players and that's what they like love to do is get as many kills in the lobby or eliminations in the lobby as possible. But yeah, like we said our Focus today is going to be  The Northeast regions week three solos World Cup and specifically day one of that we watch about one to two hours of it. It's a 10 hours live stream is it covers all the regions? So we wanted to focus on the region that we would be playing in if we were good enough. So Dennis you want to kind of explain the qualifying process because it gets it can be kind of complicated for noobs. Yeah, and that's one thing I would say either listen to this podcast to get some background on how its setup or do some research yourself online.  Because it's not the most self-explanatory system. But once you understand, it's actually pretty simple the way it works is and inversion 8.2 the update that came out a couple weeks ago actually in April. I think mid April is when it was released the qualifying process starts with the new Arena mode and there's no real set schedule for the mode. So that players can earn points whenever you want to which you basically it's a tier system. That's probably not a good term since he was already used, but it's a  There's the Visions similar to if you've ever played games like our Stone where there's different ranks and you rank up. Well, there's seven divisions starting with I don't know the exact term for the first three divisions beginner. Is that what it is?  The open division open Division and then it goes into Contender Division and you're ultimately striving towards the elite division. Although it's not called delete. I'm drawing a blank his Champions addition. If you get 300 high points, you get high points for high point and you might have doing different things like get it but by placement or eliminations those sorts of things, but you want to work your all the way up to the top division and Arena mode that  Qualifies you for the World Cup open online tournaments which happen every week and they alternate weekly one week will be singles or solo. The other one will be Duo's each weekend. Then when you if you're in Champion Division division seven each week and will kick off with the online open semifinals on Saturday these happen over the course of a three hour window where each player gets 10 matches to play Within that three hour window and then the top three thousand players in their region.  I will then advance to the open finals on Sunday. That's where the money comes in and the open finals every player will see their score resets from the previous day. And the once again have three hours of play 10 matches. The top finishers will receive a portion of the 1 million dollar prize pool and a few select players will earn a qualification spot for the World Cup in New York City on July 26th through the 28th. And that that the number of people that qualify for region, I think depends on how many players are.  On average play in those divisions like you're a nurse the North American East spot as they have they have six spots but there's also the most competitive and the most number of people playing so Europe gets I think eight qualifiers, but that's a bigger region and then Oceania gets to in 86. Yeah. So in a used to is really competitive and as well start running down the highlights of what we what we witnessed. Yeah.  And the one thing I didn't want to say is the I don't I haven't done the math, but I'm guessing it probably based on the fact that it probably comes to like a couple hundred players will qualify for the live finals in New York City in July. Yeah Esports are thing that that you and I used to kind of poke fun at but I was I don't know about you but I was completely blown away with the production that they put together at Epic. Yeah. It's kind of hard to do Fortnight as an esport because he started  A hundred players and each like there's lots of eliminations early and the beginning part of fortnight as you and I know the way we play as we kind of slow play. So you want to gather as many materials as possible find the guns that you are comfortable with and then kind of progressively get into the circle as a storm shrinks down. So with the broadcast they start off there's these two guys and then I really hype which most Esports gamers are but they're more  Of a like they feel like more studio and more polish for some reason. I don't know why that is maybe it's because it's on Twitch. So they're a little more loose but there's the two guys that do the commentating are Sundays and I want to say the other guy's name was Zeke. So they start out the show 24 cameras. And then I said say okay, let's break into the action and so they go into a game and usually there's about 35 people twenty five or thirty five people left is it's the when there's actually action happening.  So then there's like all kinds of people all over and they have a they have a my favorite angle was the wide camera angle for viewing players are highlighted in different colors.  And you can see the different levels of building. So they'll have everybody's like name or tag on there. But the wide-angle they have them that you can see the top layer of structures being built the middle and then the ground level which is nuts because like people will just fall down and like reset and kind of as the storm gets smaller and it's starting to move and rotate they'll just like fly down hit the ground at the edge and then start building up and it is  Really impressive see if you've played any level for light any how crazy they are building and the thing is it almost seems like a different game. But you're you gotta keep in mind that once you're seeing these World Cup semi-final matches where you've got the elite of the elite playing there are typically when you get to the phase where the storm starts moving and you have to keep up with the storm and it shrinks as it moves. Typically you've got maybe four or five people left at the  most they have on multiple occasions that we're talking dozens of players, like 30 people that are still left scrambling around and building on top of each other. And another quick note here is in the the world map. If you look at the map each color there each player for the broadcast. They have a different color on the eye of their icon on the map. Yeah, so and it looks insane because it's the overhead view and they're just all like scrunched up in the middle.  So many players left. The other thing I want to know is how they how Ballers that's the ball beep vehicle that you use to travel. Yeah, and you have like 200 Shield the use of Ballers as spam is crazy because I'll be like eight like when they first cut to it, they'll be like six to eight Ballers and the stronger player is just kind of Northern because followers are just stuck on the ground and eventually like the weaker players, they'll get  They're Ballers popped and then they'll just be like just sniped. They'll I should be like annihilated. Yeah, you can tell once you once you get under like 15 players the Ballers are kind of done. But yeah, the they basically get ignored and they'll get destroyed later right there. Clearly not the elite players are not using those they might use them earlier in the game if the I think that they use to get there.  But once it gets in game, they start building and don't the and so what I saw later some of the more Savvy players will have a baller like tucked away in their building. And so when they get screwed over by the storm to pop into the baller bounds over and then pop out of it and start building again as a we're going to jump into the action the first player that they jumped into and I know this might not be the best because this is the first thing that I saw  his they jumped in and they were looking at use code Remicade wait before I go with that other things about the broadcast is in the upper left hand corner. It tells you how many players are left and the bottom right hand corner. It tells you how many storms have taken place which is nice because there's nine storm shrinking and the other thing on the user display name. It tells you how many materials total they  Left which is pretty cool when they like Bounce from player to player and also has their high point so you can kind of keep tracking your head with a standings which you would think that would be really hard with how many games and players there are trying to qualify in the semifinals, but it helps you because they pretty much only focus on a handful of players, which we'll get to that later you so you can kind of see like who's good where they are and like who's like coming out of nowhere? Yeah, and if some it adds drama if they're down didn't know builds alive to you're like, oh  Oh, wow, they needed get some eliminations because they've got if they're seriously contending they need to get some material. Otherwise, they're going to be hurting towards the end game. Yes. The first player highlighted was used code Remy kid. They broke in with about 35 people have to show action. He I was really impressed the way he was editing and he was rotating really really good and he was using grenades which you don't really see a lot of that handhelds.  When he was editing hit edit throw a grenade and then close the wall immediately after he threw like it was just insane the speed they play with. Yeah, and it has like 90 degree rotations. We're just ridiculous because you just go through walls and then close it back up and then turn and like he was just like going nuts and then after they got off use could ruin kid, they jumped off to cease 100 t or cease as they refer to him.  And he's kind of a stud. He is one of the aggressive players you would say he had a really high elimination count. He probably had like 20 eliminations in that first game. So he got a crack like it that's just 23 points. So he got more points with eliminations and most people do just trying to survive and win the game.  Yeah II he impressed me as well the player that I saw it that stood out to me the most was teeth you T Fue he would he was playing The High Ground and then he was able to then he just get pull off some insane shots from crazy distances get eliminations and then it got to a point where he needed a drop down to get material drop down and then the next thing you know, he's right back up uses a launch pad gets right back up to the hot.  Ultimate High ground and he ended up winning the match. He ended up getting I believe he had a final score of like 24, which is insane and one game. Yes. The other thing that I noticed is  The announcers were hype but they weren't like as annoying as like I try to watch OverWatch to try to understand why that game so popular but the broadcast is like very it jumps around a lot and the screen because that games effect faster paced game is the like there's it almost gives me motion sickness and I don't get motion sickness. So the announcers were hyped but not like over-the-top. I would say. Yeah think they point out they point out really useful things like that. One of the guys was like,  The play-by-play guy and the other guy was a color commentator at the color commentators and for that I was really impressed with because they picked out things that I didn't necessarily notice like a little corner sneaky peek. I think seats was the first one to do that where he would put a window right next to a wall like in the corner and just like get people like he would he would he kind of would like he likes he's had like a sixth sense of like hearing where other people were and he would like put in a window over in the corner and then  Just like get people that way to it was really impressive. I think Grove was doing that to which I don't have a lot about it, but I know they highlighted him and like one of the first couple games and he was doing pretty well. But I think he was one of the aggressive players where it look really cool on TV, but he got smashed with like 10 places to go. The thing I'll say about the commentators is they were very additive. They weren't just screaming and getting excited like they actually explain the action and it similar to  In professional sports, you felt like you've learned something about the game and it made you a better player at least appreciate what you're watching more. Like they are additive. They weren't just voices screaming like he's sometimes the another Esports that I've watched before and then the next thing that I noticed is they like jumped into logic which is a player's name and hit he was like doing some decent editing and stuff, but then I don't know exactly what happened. It's been I watch this on like  Wednesday so or Tuesday and we're recording on a Saturday so logic died with no limitations. He got trapped and was kept up by the storm. So he was his main highlight as a stud and got eliminated by being trapped by the storm / structure. So that was that was wild to see you to see how like I would have never thought to eliminate somebody just by trapping them, but because like usually like we said like in  Casual games or the more casual less competitive games when you get to like the last five people you still have like probably two or three or four storm resets. So you have a lot of space so you really won't get trapped. But this is this is what happens when the storm starts moving and shrinking like almost like instantly and we're just to give an idea of where we're at. We're you and I are basically about mid-tier or mid-level on as far as reaching The Division Seven. I'm division four  When you're getting close to that, we're I said, we're not by any way or any stretch of the imagination professionals, but we aren't novices either. We kind of get what your we get what you're supposed to do. We just can't quite do it yet. Yeah, we're not fast enough. We also play on the switch and with controllers so we don't have when Otto build which I think would come in handy in the lake and the end game as I call it the other thing that okay so jumping  Onto another game there is a game which ceases do is partner 100t Caillou Z, which is nice at the commentators gave us an info. He had a come-from-behind win on the ground and it was I did it was so unexpected because he was he was like basically playing from his ass just playing out of his ass and he got like he got pinched so used the rift and then landed on the ground and he was unable to get the better.  Our advantage and I think this is the one where he was shooting at the weak points of little cones is what I call him like the roof. Yeah, the pyramids yeah, he was he was shooting through that and he was able to win by playing from the ground and usually that's impossible because if you're on the ground and a very small Bubble at the end of the game people can people with a high ground you just shoot down. It's like fish in the barrel because you have nowhere else to go right but he was able to come away with this crazy win.  And also that's another thing that I liked about the broadcast is they'll show you the entire view like the wide camera angle on the left and the final two players in a split screen top and bottom so you can see like what the Everett what the players are seeing and what it looks like if you're just a spectator watching. Yeah, it will in the weight moving if anyone's played team Rumble mode in you notice that there's lots of building that goes on in that mode that's like Lego  Struction compared to actual construction. There's the amount of building that occurs is insane. I was not prepared to see that. Yeah, and so when you fall if you're on the higher level when you follow you almost guarantee to land on something else granted, you're probably going to get eliminated. But yeah, there's the way everything is connected. It's like a whole new like part of the game is built which as honestly that's what I like about Fortnight is like there's a lot of platforming and  Video game stuff that you've learned since playing it from the 80s and 90s like Granite is in a 3D environment now but like you're creating your own platforms, so that's really cool. And so knowing how to maneuver that and kind of like I just learned after watching this broadcast a better way to like edit structures. So I don't feel like I'm like, I have a better understanding of building the walls and a roof and half a like taking away half the wall and  Like that granted, I'm not I'm definitely not fast enough to be like a top Elite player, but it definitely gives you an idea of how to play better and maybe like get a better strategy and win some of these more casual matches. So it was very informative. I feel like it helps take you from that. I mean the easiest comparison is obviously Sports meeting about Competitive Gaming, but it takes it from like rolling a soccer ball out in front of a bunch of five-year-olds and enrolling of soccer ball and in front of them.  13-year old coach the 13 year olds are going to do something that resembles something intelligent. Whereas the other kids just gonna go out there and kick around. Yeah, the other thing that so later they went to a game there's about 20 people left and then I jump to ninja which if you know Fortnight ninja is the number one twitch streamer, so he makes money all the time just by streaming and he's fairly competitive, but I don't think he's like one of the top 10 players in the world. He's just  Just a plays a lot. He promotes it and he's like just attached to the game. So he was building but there was like he was on a cliff and he was trying to hit like rotate around and he missed and he fell like 200 feet straight down to his death, which was wild to see because he's very very good at the game and he got he just got pinched and just fell to his elimination, which was I was not expecting.  That and he didn't have a high kill count and usually he's known for high kill counts. I think yeah, the other thing that is.  That's stood out to me is what like ninja Heat?  He's obviously a well-known streamer and he still goes by Ninja when he plays but a lot of players changed their names to especially in ranked modes. They'll change it to like a bunch of ones and Ells to make it look like a bar code because they don't want to be targeted because of their name. Oh, yeah, there are scared of screen watching. Yeah. Well then yeah, they're scared of screen watching and they just don't want basically a Target on their on their Avatar because if I honestly if you're in a game and you see Ninja your  You're going to want to be able to say you eliminated Ninja.  They'll see when I just seeing because it as a games or ten games you get you ten games. Okay, so there's lots of games that they are able to show you and they'll take a look at five minute break in between like a series of like four to six games that they show you in the kind of breakdown have replays and go to the big board and point out things and replays has it's interesting. Yeah, so it's a pretty good broadcast. I like the white like 49 is very there's a lot of stuff going on and the way they were able to  Do a broadcast was I thought was brilliant. The only thing I can compare it to as far as Once Again Sports is auto racing where you drop in and see the actual cars view like the drivers you yeah, and then they show the overview it's kind of like that. Will they'll drop in and out repeatedly or we're like golf but not doesn't put you to sleep. Exactly. And so just watching it just even just like the because that when they first catch up  And I don't necessarily show you the best players or the best player. They showed a jump and they show somebody that's doing something interesting and you'll see like a high school level rotations. They make 90 degree turns and they're following people and they like all suddenly like six eliminations in a row and while when I say, they're doing 90 degree rotations, that's also while building structures and going through walls and editing its it was really an interesting to watch the perfect gives you ideas of how to play better.  You're never going to be necessarily as good as them but you can mimic them and it does help like what they do make sense but like building an editing walls is I was kind of Blown Away by how awesome they were doing. That is you do that and you're moving around they structures and you'll sneak up on people who are just kind of hiding out or maybe they're trying to heal back up because I've taken a lot of hits and the good players make the rotations. I see somebody that's kind of like staggering and so those it go in for the kill.  The other thing the announcement team called the small Shield potions, which is really hard to say and trying to talk to one of your teammates. It's like hey, I need a shield potion. Well now you can refer refer to the smaller Shield potions as minis. So they shorter to shorten it to one word. So that's now in my lexicon. So if I'm playing with one of the guys, we've met actually help us get our first Victory Royale. We're going to felt house cheap a while Mikey you got any many as you got any Shields so,  That that's going to be helpful going forward and the next time I play with with strangers or even with you. Honestly, the thing is this game watching the semis you can now that I understand the format of the tournament. I don't feel like I'm gonna go I might as well not watched haven't watched the other weeks each week it resets. So then it'll just it'll give you watching the weeks leading up to the live finals in New York City will give you an idea of what to Ill. You'll have. You'll be familiar.  Earlier with the players but it's not like once you get to the life finals as nothing to do with the semis other than you had to get to through the semis default by so they'll give you a base of understanding of who these players are and kind of their play Styles so it'll be interesting to watch.  Yeah, I watched for the first hour. I also watch a second our Bennett didn't take as many detailed notes. I just wanted to see like a understanding struck out and the guys we talked about today mostly were in the top 10 but like like this like the top three thousand moved on to the next day. So if you want to see who the top six are that advance to  the finals of the World Cup finals in New York, you can go look that up. So the one thing that I thought was interesting is they had shown us like a crap load of games and then they all said and said, oh, yeah, but were okay and is on Pace to have his third Victory rally on a row and they barely discussed it and they jumped into his third one and basically just showed him winning and he had like six eliminations. So I don't think he's necessarily good for TV because he plays at a very but he's very cautious.  And he Paces it pretty well to put him in the best place to win. So he's getting he's turning out like victories and getting points that way and some of the other players that like get shown a lot do a lot of eliminations, but will Kane is over all and I think they even said it like he's not the best at anything. He just does everything and like overall like he has no weaknesses. So he just keeps it just like keeps turning things up and also an important night exactly.  It's a good comparison. The coolest thing that I saw though that really stuck out with me was like there's certain moves that I haven't seen before. So I saw a waterfall happen in real life. So that's when you're at a high level and you fall but you have a windowed wall. So you have a wall with one punch out and if you just as you're falling if you stack them together, you don't take any damage with a fault. So he did he fell with like about 12 walls leaves and then stuck a platform at the bottom and landed.  So he just like that's like basically like using an elevator or a water slide to get down to a quicker to lower level at a really fast paced that's kind of a desperation move because you can really mess up because you can start landing on the walls as you're falling. So to see that play out live and actually work was nuts and the broadcast like can't keep up with that. So A like a glitched out looks like it was falling but then they showed another view and he just it was amazing.  to see ya, so  I don't I don't have anything else to add based on what I saw in week 3, but did you have anything else you wanted to add? I did have a we are five days away. I believe at the time of this recording from week or season 9 beginning. Do you have any predictions anything you want to see epic add into the game or change in the next season?  Revert no, I solve some more things to talk about. Okay, before we wrap up I didn't want to step on your toes there. There was a later in the broadcast after the came back from the first hour break. I think or right before there is a guy named schmeckt and he got a victory Royale without getting a single elimination. So I've called him Survivorman. He's my hero. It was awesome though his it's just because it's  Skills were so hot so good. Like he was like up in the corner like kind of thing away and then towards the end of the game. He was able to I think this is what happened. I don't I mean it's only thing that makes sense to me is that he put like a steel stare or ramp whatever you want to call that structure and kind of like box the guy out, but I don't think he was like overly aggressive about it. The guy who was like being the aggressive player kind of got pinched and schmeck put up a  Wall kind of in his area so he couldn't get around the structure. Sometimes it's just the moves. You don't make that and then I watched they in between our one an hour or two or maybe it was at the end of our to they start doing interviewing people who have already qualified and there was this guy that I was really impressed with msf clicks. He had really good double edit skills. So that's where you put up a wall put punch out the window and  And really quickly edit it to something else or like so he was just like going quick. It turns out he's like a 14 year old boy and that blew me away because he was so good at the game.  And when we were 14, we were playing Madden on the PS2 or and be a wife like and we didn't have good internet like in 2001 2002 2003. We probably could have been decent players, but the internet sucked back in the day like for really good esport scene, and I don't know maybe Grand Theft Auto but we mainly focus on like Madden and and be alive but like Madden PS2 era we  Been able to win some money. But like these guys like msf clicks has a chance at winning like they're giving away 30 million dollars in prizes. You could probably win if he gets on a good streak you can we like $100,000. So we did he was going to have his college paid for like it's ridiculous. So that's one of my big take aways back in our day. If you wanted to play any sport you had to go to an NFL stadium and enter a Madden tournament with like 4,000 people. Yeah, or  or play like Halo XBox, maybe but like still that wasn't that was more local. It wasn't like a worldwide thing. Now it's with the internet in high speed. It's all done through the internet. I don't it's it's an amazing time. We are living in and we're on the we're still on the very very very early stages of this becoming mainstream. Yeah. It's getting close though. Like Fortnight is like, I can't believe how popular it is and it's on you can  It on your they said that the one thing we I don't think we mentioned was for these World Cup qualifiers. It's any device. It's open to any device that has Fortnight and for not you can basically you can play on your fridge. You can play on your cell phones. You can play on iPads. They said people on iPads qualified. I was at Best Buy, that's crazy. Did you really know? It's so big I want to be surprised if they had a fortnight branded refrigerator.  Yeah, there's Fortnight everything. But another thing I wanted to mention before we like wrapped up and start talking about our next podcast and ideas is after the game ends and you get the because the Victoria happens and so go slow motion and then after that happened, so I said that little quick zooms out the camera zooms out and shows like what like the most recent world is and it shows all these structures that are connected and like up down left, right?  To me that was like mesmerizing mesmerizing because you have all these players who are really good at the game and really good at building and so almost looks like like houses and stuff. Like there's so much going on here in Fayetteville has and Brazil like when they're built on like neighborhoods built on the side of mountains. That's yeah. That's what it looks like. Especially if it's if the final area is like a mountain or a cliff good especially with their camera angle. They're real good about like explaining how the trains that's coming up.  With the way the storm is moving the really good about explaining how that's going to favor one player over the other. It's like I said the broadcast is 8 plus quality. Yeah, and the other thing is like they're really quick to point out. It's like somebody uses a rift that I go. He's screwed. He's out of materials or he's in a bad position and then about when they say that the player will like use a rift and reset themselves or one thing and these Elite level games is they try to get the attention.  Pack of gliders because then you can you have a quicker.  Release than if you were using the normal glider, yeah, because it takes forever to open and close where as a glider. Is this really quick and you can gain ground and get on top of somebody if you're higher you can just zoom in get behind them and lay the smackdown on them because when you're using the gliders, the other players are so good about tracking the speed of layers that you need to be able to deploy and redeploy to change up the speed. Otherwise, they'll just  You down? Yeah. I saw a lot of that. Is there like a pie in there little Tower and these people are trying to gain on them, but they're having their  They're loading glider. And so they're going slower and they're just able to judge the speed, you know, like pick you off. There was one I forget who it was. So sorry for not remembering your name All-Star, but this guy was on a his zip line and he all he had was a heavy sniper and almost he was on the zip line going and he was able to while on the zipline turn and getting a lot of a Nation like right next.  This guy it was it was unbelievable. And he didn't even he didn't aim or anything. He just like boom flicked it and smack them. Oh my you got any any while out of the blue prediction as to who you think's going to win in New York City based on your one week of Ewing?  I'm interesting to see I'm giving you a 50 bucks to put on a long shot. Who are you picking?  I like msf clicks editing skills. Like he was really quick and really good and really young. So I like him a lot. Like that was really impressive apparently both were OK notice that I get Victoria royales like stacking vrs is nuts. You can Tim Duncan's got a lot of championships and then teeth use my pick Caillou's 100 tqz and cease they were just getting eliminated.  It's like crazy. So and they like ceases really good at having high ground to like he's very good at fishing the barrel and the other thing is I don't know if schmeckt made it, but I want to see that if anybody else uses that strategy where they're not necessarily good at killing or getting eliminations, but they have really good at editing skills to edit people out of the storm or out of the eye of the storm to their death like trapping.  I like he got a lot of them will eliminations but he doesn't get credit for them because he didn't actually hit them with a bullet. He just edited he just built structures around them to eliminate them. So I want to see if other people play like schmeckt and if that will  Get you in the money. Well, it'll be certainly interesting to watch as we progress towards the finals. But like I touched upon earlier. Is there anything in season 9 you want to see I want to see the volcano go away. That is a very weird thing that they added and when I get there to the Lava Pits, it's not like Fortnight because The Ground is Lava. So it's hard to kind of build up and around people and  All kinds of like landmarks that are make it hard to see other players so I don't really like the volcano.  I want to see helicopters. I've been predicting it for about two months. Now. I was kind of hoping that since this was pirate-themed that we would get.  Battleship, yeah, so maybe maybe a boat but have it be like corny like a really small speedboat or like a raft hype boat so you can get some make it to make water travel faster. Yes dinghies little ding he's doing he's amazing. They just added an invisible potion. It doesn't last very long, but when you're in when they you is called as chatter Bob, so do the shadow bomb and then you can jump from structure to structure to like kind of like  Over around the body and sneak up on them. I use that once successfully since it's been added but I kind of forget that it's there and to use it. Yeah, so it was just added on Thursday. Yeah two days ago. So I want to know if that is in what is in the Arena Battle? So it will be in World Cup. That's the other thing that's crazy is so the qualifying takes such a long amount of time that the game had will change and that's one thing I love about epic and for  Tonight is they always make the game fresh. So people want to revert back to a different system, but that's not how Fortnight works. Like they had little things here and there to make the game feel fresh and so it keeps people honest. Yeah, and there's lots of strategies to win. So Fortnight is learning how to adapt to the new mechanics, which is what I think honestly adds to the charm. But yeah,  Always going to be a core of the game is knowing how to build and edit structures and use that to your advantage and they had other weapons to make it more competitive. So like if I got a mini gun, which is the the short SMG that fire was like just rapid-fire if I had one of those gotten to like the final 10 of just like a casual game.  And a grenade launcher, like I wouldn't have a shot at winning because I would get because that's the hope one of the strategy that is able to work. If you're not that great at the game is you get in a baller and you slowly creep to the final Circle. And then then if you're decent a building you can build up to around players and are able to survive a little bit if you have some of the what quote unquote.  Pro players call cheap guns or cheap tasks at tactics, which you can get element Nations that way but in like that like we play more casual so you can win you can get a victory real just by having just by playing slow surviving to the Inner Circle and then having a good gun because if you have like I can run into the problem where I was should have been in the final 10, but I  I was playing slow. So I wasn't being aggressive enough at getting weapons. And that's the other thing is the  I ran out of balls and I wound up the guy. I got down to I had him with an axe because that's all I had left was the pickaxe and I got him down to 1 HP and I should have knocked him out, but I ran out of bullets. Yeah, but the one thing I wanted to highlight is the guys that are aggressive and get the eliminations. Like they only get to get more aggressive when they're low on materials or ammunition. So you'll see them like get  and almost like in a panic we're like, okay, there's a guy over there and get him and they run and get their stuff and it's a high-risk move. But if they have decent editing and building skills, they can put up a wall. He'll up get materials and then go back out to doing what they're doing and rotating around the circle and getting their 90-degree rotation, but it's interesting to see when they like it's like it's almost like  When they're low on materials, it's the same thing as when you put a magnifying glass on Aunt runs away because it's catching fire like that. That's what happens in this. So it is it makes it interesting to watch if you have some idea like we've put like I put in a hundred ninety hours into Fortnight. So I have designer staying in the game, but then watching the elite players play you can kind of get  Biology is because or you can get more informed about the game because if you're just playing casually when you get eliminated, you're like, well that sucks. You don't understand how you're getting beat so badly. Yeah.

spotify:episode:7dEbuTgXCXjIufsfgyohnI	I've got something very excited to tell you this isn't about the Sheep again. Is it no, have you heard of anchor that seen that waste on a boat close? But you're completely wrong. It's an app where you can record and distribute podcast of must cost a lot of squid. So that's where you're wrong. It's completely free. We use it ourselves. It's really helpful to see who's listening to your podcast and even that you have adverts no matter how small your audience. Oh my goodness. I mean, we do have 5% of Malaysia listen to our Focus every day. If that's true. Where can I learn more? You can learn more I need to do f And also download the app free today your point was that we can try it. It's a be present, but let's do it. Are we just doing a little test? Okay. This is our first episode the meeting Voyage of the podcast and is he currently didn't know the name of the podcast already unnamed and and I've got a I've got a name. Yeah, and we just need to see which fits yes best. So  for now, it could be called tete-a-tete. Oh my God, that's incredible. Do you know what that means? Absolutely. Do you want to take a punt at once? Okay. Okay. I'm think is it in another language or is this like Latin or see? It sounds French two - always so T ET T ET e tete-a-tete. Okay. I love that.  I'm going to say it means like you know, when you like jiggling along like you just like other dogs beautifully today. I did see you think it's like kind of dance. Yeah, like a somersault. Yeah, that's one thing that's good. That's good. Okay. Do you want me to reveal what it means now, or do you want me to save it for later or do you just what are you just happy with the being that I feel like I don't need to know you don't need to learn right? Okay, so in a anyone else  You can look this up. Yeah, I feel like I'm happy in ignorance Tech. See it says it I like it. I guess hello and welcome to today's episode 1 this is the pilot episode it is it is the theme for this week is pilot. So each week, there will be a separate theme and this will usually just be one word maybe too and we both just discuss so it's  I was thinking pilot episodes. I'm assuming you went along the same lines. I did not I really did not. Oh no. No, no. No, I know. So we've taken different routes and we don't know who like, what are you to everyone else? Yeah. It's only now that has been revealed. Yeah. So I looked specifically at Pilot episodes and you look specifically at Pilot. I'm talking about the area you're talking about the organic and they go Okay, so  I think Josh would like to take it away pilot. So you want to go first? Yeah, do you want me to do a bit and then let you go or your me to just do all of yours the door of yours? Okay. All right. So I was talking about pilot episodes over again. This is maybe just taking off one website. So this is one websites opinion of the best 20 episodes best pilot best Pilots, depending on the TV series, I think but a lot of it they seem to relate a lot to best Pilar and  The rest of the show the rest of the show as well. So interesting how just met you. I haven't taken all of them and they have got a few okay, I guess you can tell me sort of what you think. So I'll start with number 20. I thought we just discussed the TV shows pretty much Futurama Futurama. I well know. I've never seen any of you never seen. Have you heard of it? Yeah. Yeah. It's the same people who do Matt Groening. Yes. It does The Simpsons. Yeah.  And I really like and everyone seems to love it. So yeah. Yeah, it doesn't have any more don't think people kind of like Rick and Morty Vibes. Yeah, I can see that it's well, it's all to do is sort of futuristic Technologies, but the robot they're like right there is a robot bender. Do you know sort of what happens? You know, they're one with the ginger. I can't remember his name. No, I don't have one. So what happened is the year was 1999. Okay New Year's Eve. Okay, just  70,000. Okay. Okay, and there's a pizza delivery guy amazing work. I can't the whole premise is working somewhere HD and it's beat sir. And there's these cryogenic Chambers. Okay, where you saw freeze yourself? Okay. So is he in his pizza as he did you do you literally just it's hot or if you didn't answer he falls back, but it's Chad falls into what closes and he's Frozen.  For years and years and years and years and years until the year, whatever the future fantastic so he's he's time travel basically, would you come as time traveling? No, you wouldn't know so you in town. He hasn't he's like stayed still the whole time see what it's like in his head. He's time. So do you just time travel mean? I feel like maybe jump. Yeah moving but not the not your personal perception jumping. Have you mean? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you know like when they go down on the plate the plate  It's like an hour and then it comes back and it's been 10 years. Yeah was out there that time travel would you say it's only that I'm like, oh I could depend there. It could depend on here. We've got it right here makes me so sad. I'm just going to put that away. What the person seeking Leo. Okay defined style. I guess we need to pop out I think.  So there's a girl. Yes. Yes for her technically time. Although know if I had not time travel for him to have your dad. Yeah. Dad is home. She's just chilling. So time travel could just all be a matter of perspective.  Yeah for him is done trouble when normal but then if everyone's doing it then it's not. Okay. We kind of we can go your lines. So that's teacher and he's also I would say there's a character is very famous. The former US president right whose head is in a jar. They bring them back to life and just have the heads in jars. Do you want to take a guess at?  Which u.s. President Kennedy? No, Truman know, why isn't how cool Lincoln? Yeah. No, it wasn't in Nixon. Nixon. Nixon is a famous character makes it yeah it is it is not any of that. I feel so that's number one. That's number 20. They're still pretty good still pretty good so freaking and so I've got  You this dog done? Hit me up. Hurry up. Now. This is a very famous teacher is very famous now. Okay and is a very popular now, it's I'd say it's a good one to choose Game of Thrones. I classic which is number 7, which is number seven. Oh, yes. Yes. I thought I'd hit you with some facts, but this is very difficult. So George RR Martin the author of eight books. Do you want to  know how much you may even Game of Thrones first after picture made 15 million. Oh what apparently this is apparently is important sources on the internet. So when it first I must be absolutely he must be what's more interesting is 2015-2016, which is when the stats of latest caught up to he made 9.5 million. Oh, so he's making less money each year.  If you look at the graph it it's just like maybe the maybe they're like older books or less. Yes. I feel like they're using less Source material there are stuff. And because Game of Thrones has become so big it's sort of like he can take yeah that's less from it. It's kind of bigger than his. Yeah. I know obviously the original series. He probably made that same so much money because of like or the copywriting and stuff like that. But once they had the character number one day, they would call the all the  By that point and they could just do what other ones exactly interesting interesting interesting. That's so much money though. It's a long 15 million. I can't even this videos of him when people like one more books and he just post a video of him naked on a trampoline in his back Garden jumping up and down exactly. You just do what you want it to be honest. So he sets it was number seven. So I jumped on  Not just because some of them are like like lost or something. So this is the best the best the best the best pilot if you had to pick a best pilot  I mean friends is quite iconic. Okay, so you've got friends friends is quite iconic Fargo is apparently being judged as the best pilot. You know, what I keep doing with them. John Watson might bring lots of free math. Yes. I wish this really recently. I have you. Yeah, I think it's very good. It's very good. The interesting thing that fogger does that none of the others on this have seen to do I wouldn't say it's not uncommon but each  It has different characters and different actors.  What's your opinion on it? Yeah, American Horror Story. Yes, and he's very like unique and I like it. Yeah, because like same actors, they're so good. Yeah, but this is different actors different actors of different carry that story The story's different story same sort of it's just the only thing that stays the same seems to be the setting pretty bottle and the title obviously, I don't know how I feel about is it the same TV show if you take out the actors of the characters  Philip such a thing. They go first question place of compassion for them. Maybe I feel like if it's under the same company, yeah and everything and people watching it for fur. Yeah, they they still know what there as long as people still know what to expect from it fair play possibly the fog. I don't I can't support that though is very very good. I think is very very good. I think we watch the film recently. I remember you saying that the that film is basically the first episode of  Yes a the first season I think spirits to save they've got the same characters and roughly the same story lines. I'd say yeah, it's very it's very it's very very good. Very good sanding drum be ending. He like into the poster of fish here. Yeah. Yeah. It's very good. Now this one I know is very close to your heart. Yeah, if you can guess what it is. I will give you a brownie point.  Be not sure look amazing. Amazing is the number six is very interesting me. Yeah, the pilot was never aired on TV.  Huh? It's pretty much the same story line except the pilot was 60 Minutes unlike and the producers said turn is the 90 minutes. We want 90 minutes. So they redid the pilot for 90 minutes. What the heck? So I've looked on his website. He gave some very interesting differences between yes. I don't know why you know why someone went into this was detail. So these are so yeah Sherlock, where's a  Suit wow in a study in pink, whereas in the pilot, he was wearing casual Jean. Wow. How does that make you feel fantastic? I want to find this website share lucky emails his brother Mycroft in the pilot and wow. She looks hair is a bit longer. It is study. I mean and then I wrote after that discuss hair. So this girl's hat. Well specifically  Sherlock or he does have very good hair. I don't know why someone how someone could notice I notice so much and I don't know how that does that affect the plot in it.  I do love shot at a study in pink is Iconic so good. So so it's very good. I just love Charlotte one-eyed anything that I've heard so many times. I've seen it quite a lot. It's one of those that just start watching Sherlock again, and then you're so like yeah. Yeah, so you're always going to watch it die but in person so yeah amazing. So we move on to that was so good. Make sure you've got well a very different very different tone Josh. I'm gonna talk you through the RAF. I've got it.  A lot of little stuff it's gonna get so I'm the area of I won't lie. I was inspired to talk about your EF from a horrible history song Classic. How do you how do you say yes, please? What? Yeah. Have you seen in the RAF pilot song? It's a kind of you need to use getting that's very good. And anyway, so the iaf was founded in 1918, and I don't think so. First thought was did they have planes in 1918, which they obviously did that. I was also like did Italy and  DaVinci make planes and why do we have the area for and many doors also Mountain a team like the war?  I mean what's happening? So the first plane that they had the top speed was 70 miles an hour. 777 some space Museum's the motorway. Yeah, so need to just let me just drive. Yeah, so I think it's that bad now. I did like their motto. Although I think they're getting a bit big for their boots because in Latin it is pair. I do our Ad Astra which means through diversity to the  Dolls, which is quite quite. Yeah, but you're not going to the stars at 70 miles an hour. No, maybe it's a name for the future testing interesting. So and also if you're on the ground you look up I mean planes are pretty much. Thanks for stars. Anyway, so the RAF was kind of chilling chilling and then the shit hit the fan.  It World War Two. Yeah, so we had one point two million members are so many members rambling in the RAF and well to what the hell so many is because the actual requirements or whatever very yeah, that's very very very strict. So 30,000 now I've been interested to see what the issue climates were for there. But us so many people please. I think they must have let any Tom Dick and Harry in I mean it was World War Two I mean  Take away exactly exactly and if of than 1.2 million 70,000 died, which is a lot of people but also out of 1.2 million. I mean, I don't know how do you feel 70 million seventy thousand eyes quite a lot of people we compare that to the amount of people who signed up exactly exactly and was that I always encourage 911 but - it's like 3,000 interesting that you have a baseline compile everything.  Deadly thing to be in and at one point the lifespan of a pilot was four weeks. I know right? I was like in the interviews the like yeah. Congratulations. You're a pilot cool. Now your life's wants for we do you reckon they got a party if they lasted like that we find because everybody congratulations try last another four weeks and then it's like a birthday party.  Live live like to lifespans now like that like that like that was good. I'm sorry. Okay, I'm all the world war what to Aria for website. They all chant about this guy called Mick manic, which I think is quite good name. I like the alliteration in my name's make Monica. So this guy he was literally a crazy guy. He shot down over 61 German planes.  Just a little but a lot lots of planes and he was very good at killing people. So because of that he was given laser light metals and stuff. So there's a thing called being an air ace like a CEO. Okay. Yeah, he got that very proud then okay, he died from just being a violent on the 26th of July, which is the same day as storms. He's worth birthday and also Santa books birthday. It's very interesting.  Is a so such a bullet. So Sandra Bullock in gravity. She has do you think that makes it better for then storms? He would just he would just you know, you just feel like he'd be good at almost. Yeah, he's good at everything but I feel like songs about look when push comes to shove. I didn't mean shit. I don't know should get the results so you don't think you think I put my money plus gravity wasn't a very good film and it could be done. Sandra Bullock's piloting an interesting. Yes. I like that. I like that. Yeah. My mom is  something something interesting. Anyway, many many make Monarch did not do well he died Arabic and he was given the Victoria Cross after he died and I was like, what is the Motocross like everyone talks about the Victoria Cross? Like what's the dealio? Essentially? It's just the girls that they give people when you don't know a thing. So there's been only about a thousand people to have the Victoria Cross ever. It started in like 1850s as for a law, but then out there's like 1,000 people 628 room world or one  I appreciate that. I appreciate that. They don't give too many out. Yeah, I ever Minds me of bronze Duke of Edinburgh. Yeah, it's not bad, but it's not this point. No one really says, oh I got a bronze Duke of Edinburgh because everybody's got a bronze jubilant and it's not very hard to get a bronze jukka better when you break out your gold but when you crack out the gold, that's that's that's more impressive but still exactly so I appreciate that.  The donor motivations for some filthy V IQ modulation of chairman. So yeah, so I want on this very credible website. I feel like some of these your customer website and this guy had like systematically got the addresses of all the graves of all the people I feel that I've died who have a trail crosses and you can understand like it reasoning but it's very very very weird that I mean very well laid out he  Organized by location every so I can tell you there are five in Norfolk and to in Norwich feel truth. Yeah, that's gonna work. Hey so we can yeah, I could do that. So Victoria crosses get thanks. So the most recent guy to get a Victoria Cross was a guy called Joshua leaky. Good name. How do you feel there's a lot of opportunities in big names would feel if you're a pilot.  I'm home. And your last name is leakage. Maybe you should join more of a connection and avoided by listening. But if he's gonna well, I really tried to find out what he did, but it was just like the Army have such like in the wing ways of putting things. Well, I think he kills people didn't kill people or  Xavier Village, not entirely sure, but Joshua leaky wherever you are, I think he's alive you should be to the line. Yeah. Congratulations on getting the Victoria Cross. Now this kind of works. I made a very big point of saying that the actual value of the like the metal itself is next to nothing and I was like, okay, thanks. Mr. Tinney. That is it. Is it is it but it's like the sentimental value and then I was wondering just my train of thought how much like Olympic medals are worth. Yeah and  The goal that Olympic medal is only worth like 500 pounds that's interesting interesting. But you'd get people paying for the metal for the metal itself the top tip. If you have an Olympic medal, don't melt it out sell it sell it on eBay who could buy them anything metal on eBay. I wouldn't would you buy if someone gave someone offered you an Olympic medal and he said 200 pounds Olympic medal for diving would you would you buy it I need are some  Concrete photographic really? I would see I like I wouldn't I wouldn't buy it. She's white anymore. I didn't feel like I deserved it. I feel I didn't personally go to Rio dive of the 200 200 meters that has let's say to her. I didn't win the gold medal. Yeah. I don't feel like I deserve it.  People that people came out and be like look at this medal that I didn't win but I found on eBay unique. I think a lot of people would I could see people doing it and I can understand why people do it. Well, you could just take up diving and then tell your grandkids. This is my big middle son. So badly area because this is the pilot. Yes. Yes. Yes.  I was very sad to hear that was not a single female in any of the RAF until 1994. What the fuck Aria. That's very honestly George who is bad. So I was looking through the website is all white man is all it's bad. I was like guys, please. It's 4:00 a.m. The Air Force to have their motto is diversity. Whatever dude the STAR labs. They haven't very well. No, it was bad.  They had photos and I was scrolling and I was like, oh, oh, okay. Oh, he's Jinja. Okay. Okay, it wasn't fantastic. So now here's another there's a controversy. Yeah, lots of websites try to convince me that Bruce Forsyth that's up in the area. And at first I was like Wow Brucie, is there anything you can't do turns out he's not all sorts. He has an album. He has an album. I could see that he has said I think he's got several albums. Um was he in the area? I really don't think he was  Was I like I wear I read like a lot of his biography and trying about like think he talked about if there's like even just a passing remark exactly. He were trapped her in his autobiography something. I was nothing like he had a brother that died in the area. Okay. So I feel like maybe that's the connection. Maybe they would both Called Bruce interesting just make sure that two kids both call Bruce for officer Paul. So what do you Bruce? I like Bruce has a name. I don't think it's used that.  And they won Bruce Bruce. I know but he went to school with me. I don't know it makes me think of the trees Bruce type of tree spruce tree and just me and also the character called Bruce. I think it'll roll doll but priests way. Yes, Bruce Bruce Forsyth still. No, he said Arabic. Okay, let's get this a cuz I'm like, I'm sure I saw something. I'm sure it wasn't.  To longer. Yeah, definitely doesn't do strictly anymore because he is disease. Yes. Is it because he's deceased? Well, because I think these are in the area actually today that yeah, he came out. That's why that's why just writes about it is about fish because it's not one. That's up today. Yeah, that's true. That's it. I'll just go to handle them. Actually. I'm yes. So basically the only basically the only important thing in the area. How are the Red Arrows? You know them? Yeah.  Disease 9y guys just chilling doing some like stuff and yeah, there you go. That is my that's very interesting because you hate it. I feel very educated. I feel like yours was born educating. I'm just but a bunch of episodes. I thought entertainment might as well, but I really enjoyed that understanding by our yeah. Yes, you're very interesting things. Sorry, but knowledge for the future is it is  The stars with more or less the same. So Joshua this concludes our first test we wants it. I feel good. I feel very good. I feel I feel happy. I feel relaxed. Stop Yes. Do we want to reveal the topic for the next next next episode? Yes. We have one word. The topic for next episode is battle.  Battle was quite not quite ready. I don't know what I'm thinking Hmm. We'll have to see. Okay. Well, thank you. Thank you very much.  See you when we see you whenever.	Bruce Forsyth, Sherlock's hair and time travel.

Hey guys, you can follow the show on Twitter at Dallas Hoops cast. You can follow me on Twitter ads underscore Sydney Myers. You can also listen to new  So d'z and read exclusive articles at Dallas Hoops cast.com where you can also read the latest breaking headlines about the Mavs and start shopping for Mavs gear and tickets is Dallas Hub Tabla. You know what? Okay. So this game was tough. It was a weird game. Yeah, like we won and it feels awesome that one but it was just so strange game does it? I mean, we're not we're going to look back. Yeah and the record we're not going to remember this one game against Orlando will re only  I won at home, like what kind of people have we become now? The Mavs start the season 4 and 2 and now when they win their fights not too. Yeah, but I mean like and in this game they win. It wasn't good enough. I think it's like what do you expect? You know your games that were losing the last three years that is true. Luca was getting MVP chance. I mean, what are we really complaining about other than you know, it was just a strange game like that the magic I was like I was getting annoyed by them like just roll over and die.  You suck. I'd buy them because they weren't it's not like they played exceptionally because they kept Jonathan Isaac, but they kept fighting and it's like it's over your season's over. Why are you fighting just let it go? Yeah, they just had to keep on fighting and we're like and then man if they lost this game. Oh and it was close. Yeah. We might even be on the radio for five make a mess talk as if you can just talk over me. It's okay. Were you saying something?  I wasn't keep going. Yeah, it was closed because as as buchiach, Derek Harper called him because music got a wide-open three and it almost went in and they actually had time for a tip in if somebody had you know, gotten that but yeah, it's a one point when and I guess in the end. I mean it doesn't matter but at the same time does it matter? I don't know like let's not turn try to make an error.  Native out of nothing. I mean, you're not gonna blow out every team like cat the calves. Yeah, sometimes your winds are going to be ugly. What is important is that you won those games and the last couple of years the Mavericks weren't winning those games. Yeah, there were some really terrible things about this game. The turnovers weren't good their defense. I mean, this is the first time the magic of scored over your points granted. It's only a hundred and six and in today's NBA, that's not all  But he'll just show something about the Mavericks defense. Yeah 18th in the league and they allow like one of the worst offensive teams to finally get over a hundred points. There was a point towards the end of the game where we realized they weren't going to get stops just ever so we were like just just scoring. Okay. How about we just outscore them but you know, the magic have a lot of length and athleticism and Jonathan Isaac and Aaron Gordon for a while, they really bothered Luca but you know,  Eventually, he's like, okay. I'm just going to take over and it didn't really matter. Yeah, I was thinking the same thing Isaac vucevic. Aaron Gordon is a big guy al-farouq aminu know we know him and you Michael Carter-Williams even is really long so hard. Yeah. Yeah, they have a lot of length and they played well defensively and Aaron Gordon had 23 points, which I don't even remember that happening. I don't remember him scoring his single shy and then I looked at the box score. He had 23. Well, yeah.  But yeah, so daunted finished with 27 points 7 rebounds 7 assists porzingis finished with 10 points 8 rebounds. We're going to talk about the pores in Jesus Dwight Powell had 12 points 8 rebounds the map shot 43 percent overall 35 on Three's the magic shot 49 percent overall. So again, like the defense is a problem, but I mean, you know, like you said it was an ugly win, but a wins a win. Yeah, they  Got the win in the next game. We're not even going to remember and thank goodness for JJ Barea because yes, yeah, he came in first minutes first game of the season and scored what like 11 because it had imagined seeing is a magic I think had got taken the lead up to 10. Yeah, and then insert JJ and five seconds later. It's a tie game again. Yeah, I think Carlisle was saving him like just for that moment because it was at a point, you know in the beginning of the game.  And the magic had the lead and they would be up by four or seven or five or whatever and you're like, yeah, whatevs. It's a magic they suck but then it started growing and you're like, okay guys. We actually we need to play here and that's when he put Barea in. I think it's been Jalen started off strong on the season and he's kind of tapered off a little bit the last couple of games. He has I've been playing very well. He's not making the same smart decisions forcing its yeah, and I don't even want to say forcing it just  I don't know I guess well, there was one play that Derek Harper was talking about Barea how his patients opened up the olive oil and that's something Jalen's got to work on as a patient. Sometimes he'll come off a screen and it just just pulls up. Yeah and mid-range jumper which is like the worst shot in the league and he just hasn't been playing. Well the last couple of games and I think Carlisle's like, you know what I'm gonna give JJ. Yeah, and you know, JJ is like, okay. Sorry, Jalen, but yeah.  To take a spot back Princeton was like dang. Yeah. So yeah, it's and we were talking about that exact play during the game because like right before that Brunson porzingis had set a pick and Brunson came right off of it and just took a shot and if he had waited a couple seconds and let that develop it would have been either an alley-oop or at least just a dump off for a dunk to porzingis. But instead he took it a contested shot. Yeah, we're as it was just a few plays later.  When Barea came in and like you said his patients opened up an alley-oop for for Powell. It was nice to see him out there. Yeah. I mean I felt like he deserve I know I did not cry inside. I wanted to you to cry during National things. Okay. Why are you doing this to me? Well, I'm just saying. Yeah. Well you're saying wrong there in touch with you. Okay, it would stick to the mask. All right.  We're a yes. Yeah, was it I mean did it because you know, it's he's a veteran. He's one of the boys the last time man. He's the last guy from the championship team and I didn't realize Not only was this the first game of the season but this was the first game since he tore his Achilles Last year. So yeah, it was a big moment and he came up big for them that run I think was really important and then Don she eventually just took over. Yeah. He I think and like  Eight points or something at halftime. Yeah and starting in the third. He just took over basically what he started doing is his floater. Yes floater game was just on point in this game. It was going in every time even when he was getting contact. He wasn't getting the call but there was contact there. He was still going in so I think when he was coming off the screen instead of attacking all that length, that window had he used the floater. Yeah, and you know, that's really why he's going to be one of the best players in the league.  If not already because he has and a complete a complete Arsenal. Yeah of offensive weapons that he can go to so if you take away his three or if his threes not falling like it didn't tonight or you clog the paint then he'll just go to a float game and he's got an excellent floater. Well, he figures things out so quickly. Yeah, you know, it's saw what was going on. Yeah. He figured things out during his rookie season He adjusted part of his game and now even in his sophomore year he changed he worked on things.  The same word that where he figured things out. It's like, you know, some of these things like hardened just developed a strong floater. Mostly he didn't really have to before but he just now developed that whereas Luka he figures things out so quickly. I think that helps him to progress so much more rapidly than other players, you know, so it was a good win the fact that you won the game. Yeah, and it was an ugly game. It was a defensive Grindhouse, but thankfully want it I mean  Yeah, and usually could have crumbled and well, it was nice because the same reason why we lost against Portland and against the Lakers is we made poor decisions at the end of the game or we didn't make free throws. Yeah and insert the last one have Curry. Yeah. We he missed both of them and I think a lot of that. Yeah, you know, he played the first quarter first 7 minutes and then they play again and then insert him back. Yeah, and it's like, you know, you just expect the guy. That's it.  One of the beasts I have with Carlile will talk a little bit about Carlisle here later. We'll stick with the win Maz when they're five and two tied with the Phoenix Suns. So yeah, you know we are when was the last time that was a good thing? Probably no 506. Yeah, so there are two did you want to talk more about Curry or do you want to move on that'll be part of the whole Carlisle segment? Well, there are two things that we're going to talk about one is Dorian finney-smith being in the starting lineup because that  that confuses a lot of like there are a lot of people that like during a penny Smith and then there's a lot of fans that don't it's like it's really split down the middle on that issue. And so we're going to talk about that and why finney-smith keeps getting minutes and why he keeps starting and then also something that that I have brought up a lot on Twitter and that I've seen other people bring up is porzingis involvement in the offense, and I guess we can just go ahead and start there since game just ended and  It was a story the thing is there's too many times when he's just a decoy. He's just standing out there and I get it because of his shooting ability. He spreads the floor and it really opens up the offense and it's really hard to complain when you go into the game as the number one offense in the league and yet were complaining that porzingis is an involved was like maybe we shouldn't be concerned. We have the number one offense, but there's got to be a way to be  excellent at offense and incorporate. I mean how much better could you be when more of your shots or more of your plays go through porzingis? Yeah. I just think there's too many times where instead of the two-man game with Luca and porzingis. It's Luca and Cleopatra or Luca and Dwight Powell and porzingis is just kind of standing there waiting for something to happen and it never goes his way. If for some reason the extra passes made, yeah for every other  But not poor see what we're seeing is when he's that last guy is like the player just decided that time and it's just chance. It just didn't make that extra extra pass but there's got to be a way to involve him. And I know the chemistry isn't quite there between Luca and porzingis, but the only way to get that chemistry there is by playing that two-man game letting porzingis set the pick for Luca do it over and over you remember, you know dirt would sometimes  set the screen overnight over and over and over again until Monty got the angle that he needed. There's no reason why you can't do that with Luca and porzingis. Eventually Luke is going to get porzingis involved on some of these pick and Pops now granted to the porzingis play very well tonight. Probably not, you know, he was 414 to your point. You said that he is forcing a lot of his shots, right? Yeah. So there's a few things that I think  Are happening and I don't think they all equal Carlisle being evil, but they are happening and I guess as the coach it's something that he should address. So first of all, they play the you know the for out offense where they have a ball handler in the middle and then they have Shooters around the perimeter to just spread things out. Well porzingis is a shooter. So naturally, he's one of those guys that's spread out and it's unfortunate because that means  He's not really involved in the play. He's a shooter on on the wing or you know the top of the key and so it's just because the offense they run that's where he is in the play to you talked about the how they do the pick-and-roll with Powell and why don't they do that with porzingis? And again the problem there is that Powell isn't a good Shooters. So he can't be the pick and pop like sometimes they'll run a double pick and roll with porzingis, but he's the pop guy whereas Powell roles. We know pal. Can't shoot so he  Be a pick and pop. He also can't be the four out guy because again, he can't shoot. So they're like that's a problem too that again forces porzingis to be the guy that's just out on the perimeter. And then another thing I noticed is that he liked the flow offense. I think requires a lot of movement off the ball and he sometimes gets stuck in just checking. Yeah, he sets the pick and then rolls or Pops to a spot and then  that's it. And and the only other movement he'll get is like maybe trying to set another pick and I don't know if that's just him not being familiar with the offense, or maybe that's the play but I noticed that I would say that's probably a result of him not receiving quality coaching his whole time or yeah York in New York, you know, the offense was he just had the ball given the ball let him go to work and he's really good at that but now he's actually has to run a system. Yeah.  And the system requires him to set screens to move to be patient because sometimes some of these these times when he sets a screen the offensive player just pulls up and just shoots it and he's like, he really didn't even get a chance to get open like you don't even know how the play was going to develop because the player is shot at so so quickly. Yeah well and it's like we're not dealing ones that notice that even Harper on the broadcast was saying  and I think it was in the third quarter. He was saying they they, you know need to find a way to get porzingis involved because he wasn't really a part of the offense in the first half. There was a stretch there. I think in the second half where it was a good 5 minutes back and forth between the mass of magic. I don't think prison is touched the ball once. Yeah, and I think a lot of that is our guards are too quick to just go and Carlisle's offense is really guard oriented might be the often. Yes you have  Score but you got to find a way to get porzingis involved. He's not at the point in his career where he's going to be happy with being a zero said yeah, he's he doesn't want to be a decoy right now. He's not 10 years into his career and he just is ring chasing. Yeah, he wants to have his own accomplishments to and I think you should respect that as a team as a coach, you know, don't ask him to sacrifice his entire offensive game when he's 23 years old or 24 years ago. Well and also he's really  Good to like you it was like I tweeted during the last game like why wouldn't you want to run every single playthrough Port seeing is when Luca isn't on the floor. Well, and I remember Dirk would go through stretches where just wouldn't touch the game to touch the ball and then all of a sudden at the end of the game. We needed a miracle out of him. Yeah, and he this is obviously later in his career and he couldn't make the shot and it's like well, what do you expect him to do? Yeah, he had  Don't shot the ball. He hadn't been in the rhythm of the game. He hadn't been involved. And that's one of my biggest problems with Carlisle's offense is that if you're a big who's a shooter, you're not really involved. You're really out there to spread the floor. So the real offense can happen, which is guards the guard and then the Ali of yeah Dwight Powell and you know, we're seeing is an underrated roll man. He can do it. He can do the same things that  Holidays, it's just I think and of course Howell can't do what porzingis exactly and I'm like, I'm not a basketball genius so I might be wrong about this but I think that's what it is. It's just that yeah porzingis can't you could switch him in for Powell, but you can't switch Powell out for it takes a whole Stacie away. Yeah, but at the same time they run pick and rolls with marjanovic with Beau Bond whenever he's the only big out where you know, it's another thing porzingis has to work on is his screen setting. Yeah like  He's not a very good screener. Well guess he has a thinner Frank like even though he's big and muscular his frame is kind of thin well, and he's got to work better with the the ball handler because sometimes the ball handler just goes before he actually got in position. Yeah and marjanovic is so big. It doesn't matter. Yeah, and he knows right where to go. So, I don't know like like I said, it's hard to complain when you're 5 into and you have the number.  An offense in the league, you know pending today. Yeah, and you know, but it's just it's just something that we notice and this is another thing that we wanted to I guess point out or say it's just like these are things that we notice about the game and we we talked about it because we're Mavs fans and you know, we want to see porzingis involved it and you know for other fans that are frustrated like it's okay to talk about that.  It doesn't make you any less of a fan. You know, it's just it's we watch the games. It's something that we see that we notice and so we talk about it because I think I think it's something that should be fixing and even Carlile himself. Yeah, he's got to work to get him better shots. You can't tell me you're watching that game. And and oh, yeah, I think everything's great. Yeah. I know you recognize. Okay, they got to figure this out. Yeah, and yes porzingis shot the ball poorly, but he also forced  Shots because he knows I'm just not going to get for another five minutes were a few why no right off the top of my head where he got it and he was like, you know what I'm just gonna shoot it because he knew that if he passed it, he wasn't getting it back. Yeah. There was one play where I think it was during JJ's run where JJ just jacked it up and porzingis was so frustrated because he kept trying to set a screw. Yeah, and then he just JJ Jen. He just he literally just started running back turned around he have look if Jay.  AJ made it or not. Just ran back. He's like I'm done that might have been you know confidence and JJ. She's like, I don't know. You know, there was JJ's first shot. Like how confident can you be so calm so a lot of it Motor Vehicles. Well, it was really loud. If you ever played pickup game at a park and you're just running back and forth and you were not touching the ball gets frustrated is the most forever and that's what's happening. See so many well, that's we're not going to  Yeah, and your expired registration? Yes, and I think that's what's happening to porzingis. He's getting lost out there on offense because one the guards are really quick to shoot. He's never the last pass guy like it happens for every other player. But for some reason when this the swing pass needs to be made one more time it when it's porzingis, the guy decides not to do it and it's like dude just one more pass to porzingis.  But if that's clear, but all of a sudden, yeah, it's they decide to make the pass. I think that's just chance the way it's happened. But yeah, but it's that and he's also never the roll guy. Yes. He never gets a play called specifically for him like a post up. So it's just, you know, it's a lot of things that I think it's got to be frustrating. Well, yeah, especially when it's never called for you like Carlisle, you can't tell me that car while already knows what his strength and week strengths and weaknesses are  Five games into the season never going to run a pick and roll for him anymore because that's just not his strength. How do we know? We haven't even seen it. I know in practice they've run it or whatever but for crying out loud at least give a pick-and-roll with Luca or pick and pop with porzingis rarely ever sits us sets of screen in general in the game. It's usually Maxie or Powell and he barely ever sets a screen for Luca.  And I think as yeah and it's just like it happens. Yeah, but it's not as frequent as Maxi and Dwight. Well, he does set a lot of pics but he's never involved. He's not true that yeah, he says the pig and then it's really just like for something else that's happening and it creates space. Yeah, it does because you can't leave porzingis. Yeah, but sometimes the guy does Lee porzingis and we have still not getting the ball to him.  There's just there's gotta be a way to get him involved in the offense. I think that it would help you and it's again, it's like I'm saying this and they have the number one offense in the league, but it's just I don't know. I have to imagine that you especially maybe in a game like this where it is tight and porzingis is a really good player. He's got to be able to help with that. It's I mean again, it's like it's hard to complain when you just want to game your five into your offense if I get all of that, but this is happening and I think it's worth talking about  About well, it's a pattern with Carlisle. Yeah, the same problem happened with Dirk and it was to the point where in post-games the reporters were asking Dirk about it. Yeah and Dirk just flat out said like look, I'm not gonna get into it. I'm not going to demand the ball or anything like that. Yeah. I'd like to have it my hands whatever blah blah blah, then they asked car while he's like, I want a Championship under this it's like no you didn't it's okay. I'll talks you want a championship because Dirk, okay and because Ty  Sin, and the players that are on the core mostly Dirk. Yes. So yeah, it's been a problem for a long time and that for man the for in carlile's offense can get lost. Yeah because car well uses that person as a decoy doesn't use them really for offensive purposes and porzingis is not Dirk.  Attitude personality personality wise yeah, he's not dirt. He's 24 years old. He wants to score. He wants to be an All-Star just as much as he wants to win. Yeah, and you got to find a way you're going to have to change. I'm sorry. Like you can't go the whole season. I don't even care if you're 20 and 6 if porzingis isn't involved you might as well as trade him. Yeah, I mean and it's also you want to make sure that he's happy. Yes. Yeah, you know, you don't want to that's what  God yeah, you want to keep the guy happy because you want to keep them here, but the offense at Carlisle runs isn't geared towards him getting shots. It's geared toward him helping other people get shots. One thing. I'll say is so like last year it took a long time for Carlile to adjust the offense to where Luka was the main guy. I don't know why it took that long. Maybe it took a while to recognize it and  Then to figure out how to adjust the offense. I mean that's probably harder than it sounds so, you know, we're like seven games in I can understand. Okay, give Carlisle time. Maybe it's just going to take time for him to adjust the offense, but hopefully that happens because yeah, you know, I don't know. Like I said, it's a pattern with Carlisle. Yeah, he's gonna run his offense and the worst part about it. Also. The best thing is they're winning.  Yeah, and because of that it's going to be hard for anybody to convince him. That porzingis is not happy like you you could visibly see on that play. He was not happy and I don't care what anybody says about fans. Don't know what they're talking about it we're watching the game so we can see with our own eyes. This doesn't look quite right. I know they won. I know they have a good record is a good offense. She's like yes fans. Have fun.  Feelings and that's okay and we're just we're going to talk about it like sometimes you just need to get it off your chest. But yeah, I like I said, I'm okay with giving Carlyle some time to figure it out. It usually takes him longer than others. Whatever it happens. Thank goodness. Luca is a guard because otherwise he wouldn't have stood a chance because everybody knows Carlisle is offense. If you're a guard and you're a good six feet under yeah, he can make you look like a god so  Is Luka is a guard because that's helped him to really Blossom and hopefully he figures it out with porzingis to because I mean, yeah, they are winning, but I just want to make sure that porzingis is Happy it involved the in you know, when games Win It is a rough game and they are down or they're losing I would I would I hope that he would get involved then because he is so good and could really help him. It could be that that Carlisle is waiting to a certain game Mark like 10:15.  Games into the season before he starts utilizing him in other ways and maybe just because of the speed of the game getting back in shape and all that and you can see porzingis is struggling with ball control. He had the same problem with the Lakers M. People are getting hit their hands in there and part of that is a result of just not playing once you play regularly with those kind of players. You have better ball control because you know when they're going to reach  And also some of the passes to him as I know especially tonight word were not great passes and I think that's again also just chemistry of where he needs to catch like, where is his pocket? You know, how where does he like to get it? I think that's part of just everybody feeling, you know to so another problem I have is curry and you know just for the record.  I don't want any other coach and Carlisle, but at the same time Carlisle really frustrates me with his decision making out on the court only because he's just not a player's coach. Yeah. Well everyone he's a coach is good. Yes what it says, but that's really frustrating if you're a player like Curry he started the game because he didn't come out with 15 points in the first five minutes of the game.  Didn't see the court again until the last six seconds or whatever the game. Yeah, and it's like look, I understand players. Sometimes don't start off. The right way in Lucca is a prime example of that but as the game goes on he might have come out of it and adjusted and maybe got some open shots, but you know, once he decided that that wasn't working he moved on and Seth never saw the court again until the end when you missed when he misses both free throws the two missed free throws. That's I mean, you got to make those  Free throws like regardless of when the last time you played but at the same time as hard to not play for 40 minutes and then shoot two free throws with you know, six seconds left in the game. So yeah, I mean like what was unexpected is Barea coming in and playing great Jackson also had a really good he was a spark plug for a while. I think it's just kind of shook up the rotations a little more than yeah expected. But I know what you mean. Yeah like and and there's times even like  Porzingis and Luca sometimes they've just been on the bench. Yeah, they'll go out forever. Yeah, and they have that one shot of porzingis where he got taken out of the gate and she looked confused lately. What did I like but that's just car while he's just he's gonna you know, see who's out there on the court. He's gonna check his his stats and then Linux. Yes. Yeah. So let us know what you think about that. I know other people have common or and tweeted about porzingis being a part of the offense so I know other people  People are noticing it. Let us know what you think or what's causing it. Is it a problem? Do you think it's not a problem? I don't know why but I mean, it's definitely a yeah, it needs to be resolved. But you know, let us share your point of view again on Twitter at Dallas who was cast or me on Twitter at enter scores Sydney Myers. The last thing I wanted to go into so Dorian finney-smith started in this game, and we've said it before we're not the biggest fans of Dorian finney-smith other people when the start  Lineup came out. It was like what the heck is going on? Why does he keep starting? So I wrote an article? It's on Dallas whose cast.com because I was like, okay. I just don't see it with finney-smith. I don't think he should be playing at all, but not all he's not just playing he's starting games. So I was like, okay fine. I'm going to dig in and figure out what the Maverick see in Dorian finney-smith and so in this article, I broke it down by defense.  And offense the first part I looked at was defense. That's what we're going to talk about here. And then you can read the article to see what I found about his offense. So it turns out that when you dig into the advanced analytics Dorian finney-smith is actually a very good Defender which is hard for me to say because I never I never saw that on the court, which is fine. I mean, it's like I'm not a Basketball Savannah or anything. So I just I didn't  It but like last year his defensive rating was 108 points 7, which was in the same range as Ben Simmons Clint. Capela Patrick Beverley Klay Thompson and Jimmy Butler's. So again, like really good Defenders. He's right there last year opponents field goal percentage dropped 2.4% when he guarded them which again was in the same range as Anthony Davis Serge Ibaka Klay Thompson Joel embiid. He's also really good rebounder on  On par with like Kevin Durant Sharon Jackson jr. Chris Middleton. So like all of the advanced analytics show that he's actually a very good Defender, which I just I never saw that before well made me think of football teams defense that is really good, but they don't ever get turnovers. Yeah, so they hold teams to low points and low yardage, but they never get a turnover. So you never notice really how good they aren't as like there's times where  Dajuan will get a steal or Seth Curry would get a Steeler like man, they're better defenders in yeah andorian because they're actually making plays out there but dorian's out there you don't even notice but he's actually impacting it. Yeah impacting the game. Yeah, so and like I'm one of those people which is that just didn't see it. But he's literally on par with some of the best defenders in the league Patrick Beverley Klay Thompson Anthony Davis his defensive rating when he's guarding opponents their field goal percentage.  Drops, he's not yanis, you know like yanis his differential percentage. So what his the opponent's field goal percentage drops by how much that's that negative six point five. So it's just like skyrocketing but he was offensive player of the year. So I mean, he's not at that level but he's still a very good Defender and a very good rebounder and one reason is because of his physical tools, so I didn't realize this he has almost a 7-foot wingspan, which means  His height in a wingspan, he can reach up nearly nine feet just by standing and raising his arms. So you can imagine in terms of like defending at The Rim. I can't even jump up and yes nine feet is extremely valuable and then he also has large hand. So his hand length is 9 inches Kawhi Leonard who has like the most giant hands ever his hand length is nine point seven five inches. So Kawhi Leonard's hands our own are less than an inch larger longer than drawing it.  Phineas myths. Yeah, but when you think about that that's pretty ridiculous. But anyways back to Dorian. Yeah, so I mean, he's got a 7-foot wingspan and if you look at in this article, I also have his stats on like his Lane Agility Test at the draft combine his standing reach. He has a higher vertical leap than a standing vertical than Kawhi Leonard Klay Thompson, Jimmy Butler Danny Green. I mean, he's very long and he's very athletic and so for that reason,  He's able to stay in front of either guards or Biggs. He's able to get his hands in passing Lanes or just to to swipe the ball away from his Defender and I have clips and in here of defensive plays but like I was surprised I knew I was never really impressed by his defense, but when I dug into the numbers and looked at the film, I was like, you know what he's actually a good Defender.  The problem is yeah. The problem is his offense and I'm not going to go into that here because again, it's like it's more analytics and there's also film here but he's basically like you've said, he's a 0 on all he's actually an egg worse than is your on off. I think we're just gonna have to get used to Dorian starting and I actually like the starting lineup the one they ran tonight and they did a couple of games earlier with Seth and door.  In out there, I think it's a good mixture of shooting off and devious. Yeah, so and that's the thing is like, you know, I so my conclusion was like I get it. He's a good Defender but he is still actually terrible on offense and I think they're just hoping he can develop one develop into a legit 3 and D guy and to I think Carlisle it just has enough faith in the rest of the team offensively that he's okay with what Dorian lacks one thing. I will say about him is that  He always seems to get a big offensive rebound. Yeah, you just needed one. Yeah, and he did want again tonight. He does it all the time and it's just when you need that offensive rebound, he happens to get it for you. So he is a really good offensive rebounder and just rebounder in general probably because his length and yeah, I did patient I talked about his rebounding in the article because I watched a lot of film on that when I watch the film  wasn't as impressed by his rebounding when like when you see why he gets a lot of his rebounds and how he gets them which I explained in the article, but he is a good rebounder and like, you know for whatever reason why he gets it it doesn't matter the fact is he's a good rebounder and like you said he gets these big rebounds and actually so as his shooting is absolutely atrocious and you'll see that but this year he's actually he made that big shot against the  Lakers and he had a big one tonight win tonight now. I mean, he's still not good and it's a very small sample size. But if he does get better at shooting which is all they're asking him to do he could he and valuable player Derek Harper said as much in the podcast, I'm in the podcast was entering the game. He said if Dorian can hit his shot consistently, they wouldn't be able to take him off the court. Yeah, because his defense and his intangibles that the other  That he does. So yeah, I mean, like I said, we're just going to have to get used to it. As far as defense. He is the best defender on the team. Yeah, and I know I don't always see an even now what I'm watching. I don't see it and a lot of times it's it's because he'll be guarding a perimeter player who's just you know, smaller and quicker than he is. And so a lot of times he does get beat and you see that and you're like what the heck he should I thought he was locked down.  Down, you know never get past the three-point line, but the fact is even when he gets beat because he's so long and agile, he can still affect what that player does whether it's driving or passing or whatever it is. He can still recover an effect that player and make a play defensively because of his physical tools. So it's like yeah when you watch it, it doesn't look impressive but when you really dig in and analyze the film it's like you  He he does do a lot of smart things offensively as long as he doesn't dribble. He's okay like yeah, he you know, if he starts dribbling it's like crap that's probably going to be a turnover but as long as doesn't dribble, he's he's OK out there. So anyways, the whole article is on Dallas huge cast.com. You can read it. I dig more into defense. Like I said, there's clips of defense and games and then offense and just why he is atrocious offensively so I mean like,  We were kind of right halfway because we said is how much of a negative on offense is he is it worth the defense like so here's like the summary as good as he is defensively and the analytics are like is so good defensively. He has a net a negative net rating. Like that's how bad he is offensively that for all of his defense. He's still a negative. So anyway, you can read the full article and it goes into off.  Friends, all of that is on delos, which casts.com I think that's it. I mean it was an ugly win, but you know, yeah, it's a one thing I wanted to if you get a chance to see that porzingis behind-the-back pass for some reason it didn't get a lot of love. Yeah, I think Ben was the only one that noticed it was just like oh cool, but it's one of the best passes of this season and he got the ball midair and along it behind his back to Powell.  It was a beautiful pass. I if that were LeBron James everybody was in their minds right now and it's like they didn't even notice it happen when I guess because it was so quick. But another reason why I liked it is because he hadn't you don't we would just talked about how he's not really a large part of the year out of the office. I know he had that in his game. Well, it was such an unselfish play is why it stood out to me like, you know, considering the kind of the struggles. He's had all offensively to make that kind of a  Yeah, I like seeing that. So anyways, that's it. When's their next game Friday Knicks the Knicks? Yeah, so it'd be a nice game. Yeah to get him involved in that one. Yeah, Dennis Smith Jr. Will not be playing in that game. Yeah, but hopefully the game that the game that they go to New York. That's November 13th or 14th. Yeah, like a couple weeks. Yeah, we have that on there on our list or you have that on your list of the  top five most important games this month. That's also on delos. Oops. Guess not calm. Nice. Your face is smooth. I'm smooth. Yeah, so that's on the list of the most important games because obviously and that would be a fun game to get porzingis just like 30 shots. It's just lettuce at least just make them happy. Yeah, you know one of these games because you know, if he wants to have a big game in mud and at the same time, you know, he's not going to really make it about him. No,  But he is a young person like that. He's still a kid. It's weird to say that because he looks like a grown man they seven three out there but he's just a kid 24 anything else you wanted. Yeah. I just, you know, it's good to win. Hmm. Try to enjoy the fact that we have a winning record five and to try to enjoy the fact that we have the next best player in the league and weepy.  Future MVP the week we in the playoffs try to enjoy those things and just hope that car while we'll figure all this out and they'll be so much more dominant than what they can be now. Yeah. Those are my final thoughts final thoughts game ball member you want to a game ball? Well, I know we said okay, we can't give it to porzingis her Luka because we assumed porzingis would be dominating and getting 30 points a night game.  Goes to JJ. There you go. JJ. There you go. Yeah, that's for a if you didn't know there are two JJ's with just in general. It's definitely JJ Barea tonight first game playing in the season and helped him come back from a 10-point deficit three straight threes. So JJ gets game ball tonight. My game ball goes to Seth Curry. I six minutes and then the two missed free throw. It was 7 minutes. And also I  Appreciated the two missed free throws because it made the end more exciting and I think he has a knack for Showmanship.  So let us know who you are game ball goes to tweet us on Twitter and tell us who was cast or a me at underscore. Sydney Myers or Martin is seriously considered joint considering joining Twitter.

We're going to talk about a lot of things. I'm going to try to school you on certain things that you need to know spiritually emotionally all about self healing all about spirituality or Richard. We're going to talk about so many things and I want you guys to just stay tuned to all of it. Have a blessed day embrace your spirituality and I'll be seeing you guys in a couple hours and then another few minutes.  We'll talk about beautiful things to enhance that spirituality of yours by now.  I love you, everyone.  It is 12:03 a.m. In the morning, and I'm still wide awake, but I wanted to talk a little bit about.  honesty  and loyalty  and obedience  Did times when you know, you find yourself giving too much information to people or you find yourself that people don't listen to you or pay attention to what you're saying and it's really sad and annoying. I have come across a couple people in the last couple of weeks where  They tend not to listen to advice. They tend not to hear good advice from Elders or from the mother or from the father. Whatever have you?  The reason I'm speaking like this is because these days we have to learn to have communication with our children.  with your parents  would your siblings?  What your husband because it makes a whole lot of sense.  Sometimes when you put yourself in a position where you try to tend to hide things, you know, you keep things within, you know things that are troubling you or you know, bother you sometimes it's not healthy.   when we are in our religion where in our community of jerubbaal and lukumi tradition or any 80 our community  honesty is a big thing.  If you are going to be a part of a community or part of an ATR community.  You have to talk to your partner. You have to talk to your siblings. You have to let them know who you are and what you are. Some people don't understand the gifts that we have. So what happens is people tend to hide them and when they hide them.  To me that's not being honest.  When you hide who you are is not being honest.  So what I'm saying is if you're part of an ATR community and you have these special gifts, you need to explain it to people that will understand.  So say for instance, you have an apartment you live by yourself, but you're setting up your Shrine. You have an altar or an ancestor table or something of the sort.  And people come to visit you.  Some people tend to hide these things in closets or in a back room when a basement because they don't want other people to see but these are things that you don't hide from anyone because this is who you are.  I have practiced this tradition for years and the knowledge that I have and the gifts that I have. I don't hide it from anyone. I let them know who I am because this is my personality. This is who I am I say every day I get up every morning. I said, I am humble Yonder.  I have a gift and a special and this is me, and there's people don't understand that my family don't understand as well. But I make it clear to them. This is a part of my life. This is who I am. This is who I Have Become.  Let me tell you guys a little bit about my story.  When I was growing up, I had no incentive no idea that I was going to be in high priestess because I didn't have it in mind but as the years went by and I knew the gift I have and I put it to good use and and I worked with it.  And I study it and did my research as a you know, what I can't run and hide from this and this has to go a little bit more further.  And when I became and I better be which is a high priestess.  I realized I wanted more I realized that I have to be me. I can't change for others. I can't hide who I am. I can't take it and stick it in a closet or in a bag and tie it up and keep it secluded from the rest of the world because what happens is I'm not being honest with myself and nobody else.  So what I'm saying to you is if you're a part of a community or you're a part of a ATR and you're doing research and this is where you want to be. Then you need to explain it to your family members explain it to your friend your partner if he lives with you because there's nothing like a betrayal when people come to find out  At the last moment, but oh my God, you're what you're a high priestess and you're practicing this no. No. No, you cannot do that because you either Christian. You're Catholic get Baptist. You're Jewish. You shouldn't be doing this. This is not good.  But see people go to church every Sunday and they finally that they're not comfortable in a certain place.  People go to seven days Adventists and you're not comfortable. They are either.  And they realize that they have this gift so they don't know what to do with it.  They can either read cards they can pick up on the energy and another person, you know this a lot of things that come into play.  But you don't understand it. But then you find a particular place where someone or a safe haven where someone is just like you and I'm not just saying that just one person. There's a lot of women and men that are in the same situation.  So we have to build a safe haven for women and men.  To interact with other people who are just like them.  People don't understand that the gifts we have don't have nothing to do with witchcraft. It is not witchcraft. It is a gift from Allah fear Allah the Almighty I give from the high higher up.  And if we have that gift and it's giving it to us the deal is we have to take it and put it into good use we have to use it to help others.  We have to use it to defend ourselves.  To take care of our children because most of our children not all children have the same gift as their parents.  So who else for these people to talk to rather than people who are just like us?  That's the reason why people need to build safe havens for people who have that high spirituality.  That gift.  Okay, so that they can share it with others so that they can help other people because there's a lot of people out there. Let me tell you that need spiritual help that need spiritual guidance.  And they don't understand. So if you're a great on wonderful High Priestess or babalao what by little I do believe that you are building a safe haven for these people to come into your domain your circle so that you can teach them the proper way of Defending themselves are protecting themselves from negative energy on from negative or toxic people.  Being honest with yourself is the most important thing. You got to start there first before you can be honest with anybody else. If you have a gift talk to somebody you don't understand it talk to somebody you want to pursue it talk to somebody you want to know more do your research?  But don't hide it.  You have to be honest. I know a young lady and I've known her for years and she has a other half. It's a boyfriend. I want to say her her husband because they're not married, but they both live in the same house and all these years. She has been a hype not a high priestess but a spiritual person.  And all these years she was hiding it from him.  She got initiated and she hide whatever was given to her from her Ely. So why hide it and why getting initiated if you're not going to let your partner know listen, this is what I did and this is who I am and I need to sit down and have a talk with you and explain it to you before you can become any part of an islet or an ATR community.  You have to start by being honest with people. You got to let them know what you're about. Don't hide these because let me tell you something when your mother had you she didn't hide you.  Okay.  She introduced you as a newborn to a family member to the husband to the mother to the grandmother. They didn't hide you.  The point I'm trying to make is in any 80 our community. You have to be honest with self.  truthful  obedience. That is the key word.  But you cannot go around getting initiated in different things and you go home. Oh and let me hide it in the trunk of my car or maybe put it in the closet. I have seen people and I've heard people tell me. Oh, I have an alter ancestor Altar and I have it in the closet. You don't put your ancestor altar in the closet. I have seen people have initiations in in Ultra and they hide  Ultra  All the officials in the basement they don't belong there.  people has  altars for different things and they hide them so then what's the purpose of getting initiated if you're going to hide these things?  Again, what I'm saying is you have to be honest with self you have to check yourself that look at yourself in the mirror and say, okay. So what am I going to do? Am I going to be a high priestess? Am I going to be a spiritual person? Am I going to be this or the other? What do I want to do? You want to check yourself?  You gotta be honest with self. Some people are just not honest with self at all. They just you know every day every week every moment with the same thing and they just not being honest and truthful.  Because what happens is when you had these things things don't go well for you.  Things go three step backwards for you every time.  To start off you have to learn by doing that self-healing for yourself because there's a lot of self-healing a lot of people need to do before and I believe that people should do self healing before they can become a part of any ATR community.  period  you ever seen that when you go to the captain of the church before you become a pope before you can become a nun you got to repent sins.  You got to do that self-healing for yourself before you can do anything.  Before you receive communion first communion, you have to repent your sins confirmation repent your sins.  So why not start by being honest with yourself?  People should not do that to themselves.  Honesty is the key word.  if you ever want to be able to Blossom  or you want to be able to be that and I'm not saying perfect.  Priestess  But you want to be that Godparent where your godchild comes to you and say, you know what godmother I understand.  But I don't understand this part right here.  I want to grow but then the Godmother comes to find out you're hiding your orishas. You're hiding your ancestors. You're hiding your egg wounds. What's the purpose of having these things if you want to hide them?  Big ones are your best friends ancestors are your best friends? Because they are the ones that going to protect you that are going to watch over you every step of the way.  You want to start by being honest with yourself before you can be a part of any ATR community?  Sit down and meditate Focus.  because that helps  And then ask the question is this me is this for me?  Nine times out of 10 you get that you'll have a vision.  Or your dream, you know what's coming next or what's going to happen next?  But try to be honest with yourself because it's not it's not healthy hiding who you are putting it in a back burner in a closet somewhere. So no, I'm not doing that never. Oh my God, they shouldn't be ashamed of what you are.  You have a gift cherish it because not everybody has that gift. Not everybody is born with a gift. A lot of people got to go out there and do research and get people to teach them how to do this or how to read a particular person or how to do mediumship or how to read Cara shells all these things spirituality is very important.  And it saddens me when people decide that, you know, let me hide these things and put them in closets and all the no no no, no, no and don't have anybody discovered you because when people see that you have an ancestor table in the corner. They go. Oh my God, that is voodoo stuff. You shouldn't have that not true.  not true  If they cannot accept what you have in your home, they did then they shouldn't come visit.  They can stay away.  They don't have to visit because that is your space. They have to respect who you are and what you are.  You know what I'm saying, so, please keep that in mind, and I just wanted to come here for a few minutes and just share some knowledge with you guys. I love you dearly stay blessed embrace your spirituality, and we'll talk again soon. Bye. 	Being honest with self and others in the ATR Community   
spotify:episode:0HAx2ejRvbuQD3dJ9NTBkW	 Today, I'm finishing the Beast with me. Did you always call me des and I have developed for the second time today. We're speaking about anger. So yeah, that's it experiences. And it's how we harvested and how we deal with it. That is the key factor in situation nail comes such. It's up to you how you deal with it? If you want to strike out that's wrong thing. Nothing wrong with it. But in my opinion I go to be able to thing because it shows were in touch with the side of you that has no fear No No Boundaries No Limits. Yeah because I know I get really really pissed off free really easy that's being like it's all about like, you know, it's sometimes people don't get really get angry for one reason because I say, I actually get angry because I bought up a lot of stuff then like when I get angry at so So magical smacking so like, you know, sometimes people think when you are angry like you adjust your bullshit toy, but it's not like that angers part of like this emotion you have to have in your life. I don't know like a person that can say I've never got angry because of walking all the clutter in your life. So yeah. No, I like you said it's a pack of grow most of the path of life. We don't get angry. Then there's never a good thing because it shows they are buckling it all up and sooner or later one of ours.  And then what yeah the consequences of our actions going to be able tell ya. It doesn't mean he's here. You're angry you're failure or your back person is just like some time are we have this like was it called this this like stuff that he knows that when it get to a limit like we have to know how they met how we can't push further and that's that's for human being like, you know, each individual has their own limit, but they all have one thing in common.  That sooner or later when you break when you reach it. Yeah boy, like, you know this there's different ways. You can express your anger. I think this year. I'm a lock hammer in wanting to last year. Like I'm really ready like to attack anyone that happened like so I was really ready to see I do like to talk more and I yeah that's always doing the talk and walk more but now I took this call from already.  Yeah, yeah, that's it. Yeah, like some people do like you can do a lot of sport like can do like because I make films myself now, it's Ryan directing. Yeah, so that's that's my hobby. Like I do boxing if I want to like I don't have a guy was treat timetable with my own boxing for like I do what I want to do. That's why I like this my life. I don't like feeling I'm in a book like I'm in a bottle. I'm in a box like trying everything like in the world like more  Like and it's so cool. I think it's obvious right to do what you want to do and don't get angrier and angrier about yourself if you're doing something like that like so yeah just to be free to do what you do to suit you go makes you happy and continue with life and sometimes it's just like some people think like this guy get angry really really much but to be fair like we all have our limits some people have been pushed sir.  Irony in the past and like the you stink like from my life for him - mm. Like I used my passenger the future and it's really really crazy than because you might not make necessarily want to make me angry. But like if I've seen you're being you're being a DJ for like sure to me in the past like I joined You by that action you've done to me in the past. I saw it until it's fair but like sometimes we need to like check. Like I said Wednesday like do I have to get angry?  It does matter it just you know it and not worry so much about others because I feel like there's yours. Yeah, I thought I was gonna make me angry like it's like when someone thinks I'm a joke when I don't think I'm not seeing them when people think I'm messing when I'm not messing it's so really it's so bad to my own perspective because I get really really pissed off them. So it's just  just life sometimes because most people think like this. I have a lot of experience with you and you're being a nice guy and I like so I like it's it's it's a lot of different for me Finn and Jake to another people another person and like thought for example, so not okay my yourself if you know, I don't like some people but I have to deal with them. It's a knife and that's it like to see these people find this week.  The same reaction and that's yeah, I think like super Fair like you know anger is not wanting we can anyone can say that don't get angry. Just don't just just you have to have a way to deal with your hunger Chandler angering the work for you. And if it don't work for others, you find it to be beneficial. Yeah. I have to say this on the podcast like to  me I think all the stuff and going through it's not just unique people to feel like yeah, you can you can do it like just but it's just to tell you like I'm going through it and he can't even watch it go through and it's fine if you're not feeling okay, or you're not feeling all right, for the meantime, you know, you're helping people in the wake of the modern art podcast is having a knock-on effect and it's beneficial in good effect. Yeah, don't go but this world and that is something so like everything. Do you have anything?  So I don't know about iron stuff. Like I said, I mean everybody is the individual. That's okay.  My birthday's tomorrow. So the screw my last podcast like before I get to 18 tomorrow. So I'm doing everything like gasps. Oh, I'm so happy to have developed for the second time in our podcast and it's it's so so good in your Legend my much appreciation. 	Anger is a completely normal, usually healthy, human emotion.

spotify:episode:37FjbpAmfdFnRR9fMQQXtR	Hi, it's me here. Again. Thank you. If you're a second time this month, thank you for coming back. Thank you for talking how you feel. Sorry to thank you for listening to the first one if you did.  I haven't really I'm really asked a lot of questions to a lot of people that I buy us some and  first off his bloody with trying to talk to yourself and actually hearing yourself talk to yourself.  secondly, it's a lot harder than you think to put this stuff up on on a platform didn't realize that but  Yeah, you put a host it on another platform and then it gets distributed on all the platforms that you probably heard it on like Spotify or apple music.  So today what I wanted to do with kind of give myself an overview of my childhood.  I was born November 15 1997. So quite a while ago now I'm 21 21 years old 21 years old and  From what my parents told me when I was born as soon as people allowed in I was put in other people's hands before my mom even held me which is just mental. So eyeball. I think it's been ingrained in me from from such a young age that  I'm able to talk to other people and be comfortable around other people you get a bad Vibe or sent people to get a good vibe upset people but  as a child, you don't know any different. So I was putting other people's hands and I was I was taken to that house isn't like I was allowed to play with their kids. I was allowed to be with them by Mom and Dad need a time off.  I think at the age of 3 I went to India.  I don't actually remember all of this. This is all memories that then told to me at the age of three. I went to India and I had all my hair shaved off. Don't ask why it's apparently some religion thing.  So the curls one of the cows were the clothes aren't there anymore, but I used to have quite a lot here and now verging on board. I've got these Devil's horns in my hair, but I have a luscious beard. So it's not bad. It's all too bad.  I have a younger brother. His name is Samir. I call him some like a pet household name, and but if you owe me, but if you're listening, I just wanted to say I love you, and I miss you and I look forward to seeing you soon.  It is quite lonely here bangle, even if you've got your mom and dad with you and you're still making new friends, but I'm Coming to Terms of that. I'm okay with it. It's just it's just weird being a whole nother place by yourself.  Back to her back to Childhood one of the big things in my childhood that really resonates with me ours.  The fact that at such a young age I was able to go to so many different countries and this photographic evidence of it. So, I don't remember it, but I can kind of remember some of the feelings. I remember that we went to Spain and  I was chasing after this boat in the sea. I just got paddling and paddling and paddling and paddling and before you know it I'm like a mile out my dad had to come and get me and I was so young. I was as the leather rubber ring around me and I'm pretty sure that boats probably in Africa now.  Another point is I think I was seven or eight and my dad is just got this car and we're petrol heads the whole family. My mom might deny it but I'm pretty sure she is to secretly she sorry. I take my bike out the garage. I scratched his car and he just went mad at me and I remember it so vividly because  That scratch stayed on that call. I purposely let it stay on that car for like 15 years. I mean it was only two years ago that you got to fix this happen when I was like seven.  So such a long time and it's always reminded me that.  That car is it's dangerous. It's a sensory overload, but it is beautiful and it is it's almost Perfection but almost Perfection is in the eye of the beholder and it doesn't matter what the car looks like. It's how it makes you feel.  And that car just by just by hearing it / just makes me feel amazing.  so he got if you actually listen to this or you find this somewhere on the internet, I love you and  Please keep the Porsche.  One of the other things that really stands out in my childhood is more. Like I said my ability to travel my parents have done so much my mom and dad have worked their asses off in terms of my mom raising a house running a household and my dad's somehow being able to be around as well as  as well as work and provide us with a lifestyle that  is is confit is really comfy to be honest.  I'm not Paul. No, I'm not rich. No, let me make that clear. I am not rich.  I am not someone that splashes his cash around like it's  I don't know like it's a club.  Maybe a point in life I have but who hasn't.  Where you gets to your head he build an ego.  I want to thank my parents because they're amazing humans. They like I said in the last paper last episode. I'm a product of what they raised Bo and they've done a damn good job. So I'm fucking great. I'm fucking brilliant, but then I'm saying I'm fucking brilliant their fucking brilliant.  So we get to the kind of the teenage years of my life and up until six form. I would never say I wouldn't say that. My life was interesting. I was kind of just average. I didn't really do anything special. Did I have a  David brushes no idea maybe one or two, but I never acted on them.  It kind of just flowed by nothing really happened. Nothing substantial really happened in those years and  I mean you have nothing really happened is really weird to say that such a huge chunk of your life just gone but I mean, I'm like I did I did stuff like familywize but  In schooling. No, not really. That's very people but I used to hang out with with English guys and girls and as an Indian it was kind of always you with always in between at least. I felt that and you're always like the wrong one side or the other side. So growing up. I'd always been surrounded by English kids and I felt that  I gravitated towards them in a really weird way.  But during six form that kind of changed definitely changed.  So I want to round off this episode by saying.   Thanks for thanks for listening. If you are listening if you're not you're never going to hear this and  I'd love to hear your thoughts and feedback on how if this is actually any good for you. If this is if if if the sound actually sounds okay because I mean when I play it back it sounds all right, but  This is really helping me.  I'm breaking it up in terms of like how I talk about things but it's really helping and I was just itching the whole day today of just itching to do another one had to talk to myself not for you for me. Just thinking about organizing thoughts in my mind. I never thought I'd organize and so I actually improve every single one of you if you are listening to just  if you've got something you want to do just fucking do it.  We so cool up in the hard. Just thinking everything's about quality just do it. This is this is shit. This is I'm using some terrible Mike. There's plug into my iPhone right now because it doesn't work with my neck, and I can't edit any of the software because it's just such poor quality, but I love it. I'm having so much fun doing it.  And you know, the best thing is and it's the weirdest thing listening to yourself because it's like the little voice up in your head is talking back to you and he makes sense.  This is me signing off for the evening.  I hope you guys had a wonderful day and yeah signing off over there, too.	In this episode I go back to my childhood and talk about how I was able to travel around the world at such a young age and how it shaped me into the person I am today.  I also talk about some of the things that made me who I am and...
spotify:episode:3eKEGnYyjChL98ddWkW3IY	Let's do this. Are we on dude? We're on guys this make it happen. Welcome to our second edition of think big Thursday, and there is no better topic because we are dropping this the Thursday before the end of the year at this point. I hope you have actually already written out your goals for 2019.  But the reality is 95% of planet Earth has not done that so whether you are in that five percent that has or the 95% that hasn't I believe that you will get some value out of today's message because it's something that we always hear about and it's New Year resolutions and how I personally think that even discussing New Year's resolutions. You're already losing straight up.  I've personally never set New Year's resolutions and here is why the reason why I don't set New Year's resolutions is because well, let's start off simply by looking at the definition of the word resolution and it is the action of solving a problem dispute or contentious matter the action of solving a problem or dispute. We're already losing you're already setting your goals from a place of a problem.  And I like to set my goals from the future. I like to set my goals in my from a place of if I can have it. Anyway, what does it look like not from a place of let me fix my problems that's like getting in the car driving with your rear-view mirror. You don't drive in your car looking at the past right? I think the art of having the art of creating a Quantum Leap comes from thinking about something that's in your mind.  Coming from a place of the ultimate Vision right coming from a place of light man. What's really possible in my life that right? There is why I do not set New Year's resolutions. I think about Visions. I set goals. I manifest my dreams and I operate from the place of the future and I work my way back.  So today I wanted to share with you. I'm going to put on what KP calls corporate Kev and I'm going to break down the smart method of goal setting. I've talked a lot about the seven equities and I think the seven equities I've always used the seven equities as the foundation for coming up with my life plans. My one year goals my 3 year goals my tenure goals and of course by now, you should know what the  Seven equities are which are mind-body-soul family friends business money. Those are the seven places. I recommend setting your goals. Also, there's a little bonus area which I just call stuff things. You know, that's where the toys you're thinking about lie. That's where the watch the car. That's super crazy TV that just hangs on the wall and also looks like a piece of art when it's not on my things tight. That's where that stuff goes. That's a bonus area, right, but the  Main areas. What are the first three first three our Mind Body Soul Mind Body Soul. Those are the first three years before you're there for your family before you're there for your friends. You gotta be there for yourself mentally physically spiritually then family then friends those first five or where the party's at guys. We want to ball out in those first five. I can't say it enough. I've been saying this for 20 years. How crazy is that? Some of you might not have even been born?  Yeah, I think our average The Listener was probably five years old when I started working on this thing called the seven equities and I'm going to be talking about this till I'm blue in the face ball out in those first Five Guys Mind Body Soul family friends then business then money. So now that you've heard me talk about the seven equities nine million times. Let's talk about the smart method of setting goals.  When you use the smart method for seven setting your goals.  I think that it will give you the ability to really ask yourself is this thing real or is this just some random idea in my mind, right? So let's break it down the acronym for smart. You ready specific measurable actionable relevant time-bound.  Specific measurable actionable relevant time-bound every single goal that you have you can go through this process and and dive a bit deeper go on a little bit more into the process of making your goals real. So first and foremost specific is your goal specific. Are you saying go on a vacation? Okay. Well go on a vacation could mean a weekend at the Red Roof.  In in Rancho Cucamonga, there's your vacation your next thing, you know, you're like what the hell am I doing here? What am I doing in Rancho Cucamonga? Nothing against Rancho Cucamonga. I used to live there and it's actually become pretty nice place, but you probably don't want to take a vacation there. However, how did the universe know that how did God know that you just asked for a vacation or you saying you want to be in Bora Bora?  the glass bottom  Glass bottom one of those things going Bungalows dude that Hut that's like my goal right there that's been on the vision board for a minute now and you want to be there in August and you want to fly first class and you want to come up on a super good deal. And the whole thing is only going to be 1,500 bucks. Right are you saying? Well, I want to be healthier or are you saying I'd like to lose 15 pounds or even better than saying it's like to lose 15 pounds.  We going straight to the goal. I like to be a hundred and fifty five pounds ten percent body fat and I'd like to have abs like a ninja turtle, right? What is it? How specific are you saying? I want a new car or are you like I want that. I want that new 458 and I want 22 inch I guess on a 458 you can I put a maybe a 21-inch hre. What is it? How specific are you can you  See it. Can you feel it? Can you taste it be as specific as possible with those goals when I read more books or do you want to read one book a month as specific as you possibly can be number two, is it measurable is your goal measurable, right? You have a step-by-step process for how you're going to save or for example, if your goal is to save money, but of course you got to make a specific so then you're  Our goal is to save a hundred thousand dollars. How would you make your goal of saving $100,000 measurable? Well, if you were to be able to break that down into quarters, then that means that you save twenty five thousand dollars per quarter, right which means that you would need to save $8,000 a month right when you're able to break your goals down in a measurable process you're able to take a look and and I believe when you make your goal.  Measurable man. That's what you really look at the whole thing and tell yourself. Holy crap I could do this or maybe you look at me like you know what this is actually actually can't wrap my brain around this and then it might cause you to adjust your goal. I know for myself personally when I took my goal for what I'd like to do in real estate and 2019, which is sell a hundred mil. I broke that down into 25 mil per quarter kind of sounds like a lot.  To be honest, and then I broke that down even more and I'm like well, wait a sec. That's only eight million month. Then I broke that down even more. I'm like, wait a sec. That's to Miller week. My average sales price is about to Mill that's a dill a week. I can do that. But see it required me really obviously first being specific and then being able to have a measurable result on my goal. Is it measurable?  step 3  actionable we want to be able to take our big goals and break it down into action steps. What do I gotta do to close a hundred million a year? Right? What I got to do to be able to close a two million dollar deal a week and for myself personally in my business. I have a ratio of what happens on my appointments. I know that for every appointment that I go on a percentage of them. I will simply close so I was able to break down my process of how many appointments  Per week. I need to go on in order to guarantee. I closed a deal every single week. Well, here's an even bigger question.  How many people do I need to talk to on average to guarantee that I go on an appointment housing the break that down? So is it actionable when you take a look at your goal? You want to make sure that your goals and the way that you're going to achieve? It has a very clear plan of action and when you do that and the next step all you have to do is show up and it's right there in front of you Travis and Judy from  RK sell a team. They have literally broken down every single street that they are going to be on there Travis and Judy are going to be taking over the Hollywood Hills by the way in 2019. Shout out to them. So if you got a real estate Going Hollywood Hills, trust me reach out to Travis and Judy they have probably knocked on the door of wherever that house is, but they got an actionable game plan. They have a game plan of every  Go home in the entire Hollywood Hills and the date if I tell them a street name, they can tell me the date that they're going to actually be on that street. How crazy is that? Now, you know, sometimes we have to shift sometimes we need to Pivot and that's okay, but having a step by step actionable plan is a game changer for your business. It's a game changer for your life and to game changer for how you will ultimately turn your goals into reality.  Our what is the our stand for in the smart method for goal setting R stands for relevant relevant are these goals relevant to you or do they just sound like a good idea this doing yoga just sound like a good idea to you. But when you really think about it, you ask yourself. You know what I'm just not gonna do yoga. It's just not my thing. You know. I'm trying to get myself to set the goal.  Of completing a triathlon, but the reality is I just cannot first of all, I ain't rocking Speedos and second of all, I just don't like to swim. I've got a thing about the ocean for starters and even if I don't have to do my Triathlon in the ocean, which I'm know I'm going to but I know some of them they are and lakes. I don't know man. I just the idea of swimming is I'm having a very difficult time with that goal because  Being relevant to me. So I'm working through that when I thought about running and my goal of doing the 5K a day for a hundred days in a row. I've had a lot of fulfillment from running and I've had some really great experiences and running around my first marathon with my mom and a group in Seattle, and it was just a really great memory. And so when I thought about and then also every Thanksgiving  Even day for like eight years. I always race my stepdad James and the Dana Point Turkey Trot and he beat me for like seven years in a row and last year. I'm like, you know what this old man James my step-dad is like 300 years old and he looks like Thor for some reason he's a freak of nature and he has destroyed me year after year and I was fed up man last year. I said I am going to be  James and I finally did it last year. But you know, I've had all these experiences with running. So when I thought about doing the 5K had a hundred a challenge, I'm like man. I'm about this. This is relevant to me. I want to do this a lot and I have a lot of goals with buying income property that's relevant to me. Right? I'm into that. I'm into real estate. I get approached all the time by other people and their goals and the reason why I don't take them on and  It might be this crazy thing and all you can invest in this CBD thing. It's a next big thing. I get it CBD world's blowing up. It's just not relevant to me. I cannot get anywhere close to it. It's just it's just not my thing. It's not relevant to me. So remember make sure that your goals are relevant to you. They get your heart beating and it makes sense to you and you're not doing them for anybody else but yourself.  And lastly time Bound for 2018. I set a big goal for something and I didn't achieve it. I achieved like 70% of it. And the reality is I did not make when I look at why I didn't achieve that goal and I look at was it specifically allows specific. Was it measurable? Yes, but here's the thing. I didn't measure it step by step was it in it was it actionable the big vision of it was but I didn't  Eight smaller steps. Was it relevant? Yes, was it time-bound? Yeah.

spotify:episode:3mziTEU6vMO9dtcfiEfemp	 I hope go is in there. It probably isn't I don't think it's a nice. Go ahead. Okay, welcome to Boca. Oh  We got really coordinate that type of thing. Sorry, welcome to the first episode of The Roommate agreement. I'm Rishi and I'm Nick and this is our podcast how we should have time that it is stupid. All right, you wanna talk about why we made this thing? Yes. Why did you say to me that you wanted to make a pocket X well because I still can't believe that we actually I feel like everyone has a podcast nowadays. I can't tell you one person. I know who dug a I would say a few of my friends have podcasts.  And not just podcast just like Vlogs and yet but we'll get to that later on and I just thought you know, what better way to express my thoughts. Like I feel like people day-to-day think hey, what is going on inside rishi's head? It's like the meme. So, who do you think and how self-centered of the thing to think is that crazy people this what you're thinking of yeah.  No, that's what this think. That's a crazy people think of me that type of thing. I'm just that much of a narcissist that people people. I think that people think of me. They're really weird Kitty is like I think it'd be kind of funny to hear my thoughts online. Okay, obviously my PC thoughts online, I will say there's a lot more apparently from what it seems like there's no one from my high school who has become anything close to I guess you could say like a celebrity, but you  Have multiple people you have a girl who's big on Tick-Tock. You have multiple people making podcasts. Like that's kind of crazy to me. Just the Lake Mary lifestyle. Yeah, that's true. We're yeah Stuart is just like a little know where to but I like your I like your friends because they are so interesting to me because I think you know who I'm talking about just saying the name we can you will see me like jet Joey Connor all those guys I hear you.  Say Mike. Well my okay goddamn. Okay, Mike is our audio Gary of fourth roommate. Also my audio best friend. He is downstairs right now listening to us record this live set up to you Mike. We're getting this whole thing's getting this thing started for me. I love you 3 mm you and Mike put all the effort into this. I have done nothing but sit down in this chair and give you shit about starting this.  This well, ask it is now happening and it is all thanks to 50% me 50% Mike 0% you yes, and I will profit I we had to talk about that afterwards. Well my expectations for this podcast. Do you have any expectations low ones? Yeah. Okay. That's kind of mean. I'm sorry. No. No, I mean  I okay when you originally said to me.  Let's start a podcast. Obviously. I thought it was a joke. And then you said no I want to my friend is your name Sarah? No leave names. Okay, so then I don't know what I forget. You're so close. Everyone's gonna know who you're talking about. I think I know it's yeah. Anyways now I'm not going to say and you said like how she was real big and she what did she just like didn't she like mention that you should start one or something like that Blaster like what it takes to start.  Okay, and she said that I should start one. So you took that to heart. I probably shouldn't have it was probably like you should start with it was more of a joke, but I kind of think like it'd be kind of funny. I think once we get guests on here like when I meet your friends and then when you when we get like some of my friends on here, yeah, and we just like some people that we're going to have on here are just as crazy as can be and will probably carry the entire thing. I think that talking to some people  Like that will blow my mind and blow some of my friends lines because they're just like it because some of the stuff that you're telling me that happened in like your high school and stuff like that that stuff wouldn't fly what like like Captain County for example, Captain County like and then when we went to tailgate and he was there and then those people from your high school that were like a bit younger they recognized him and I'm just like that's stuff would not fly on at our school.  Like people you get beat up for saying things like that. Yeah. I just got a text from Christian Mike's brother. Yeah saying Nick and Russia are beginning recording their Prague cast and said they and didn't mention me or someone. Shout out to you Christian shares your mission. There's Mike I know you okay and I will about a little bit about us Nick and I are former roommates. We are now roommates again, too.  Years ago, I got an email saying I was going to be roommates with a Rishi Patel as Indian as a name as can get am I allowed to say that you're allowed to say okay I give you that does sound bad but like I mean it like that but like and so I expected. I don't know what I expected and you had two pictures on your Instagram when I don't need to spend time talking about it. No one was of white.  Like whale or something like that and the other beluga whale and the other was of your forehead and as I showed my friends and the first thing jet said was what is wrong who you are so screwed Natick, so and then when I met you it turned out you were as much of a white boy as I am and I know how it be manseok's it's Barry's all day. I'd be reppin that I was getting not anymore. So, yeah, so  Your former roommates and our roommates again. So thus the name the roommate agreement. I was trying to remember what it was and I can remember I keep all my idea keep on forgetting no wasn't yes. It was. No you said to me we need a name and I told you we were at flag and I told you hey, I thought of a cool name for the pain I said, hold on. I got an even better one. No don't even steal that from me. Okay, I don't even that is my pot of gold. Those are my Lucky Charms. Don't even steal. Any I need to contribute something.  Well, I'm waiting talk about something. Do you want to do you want to talk about as I as I can't read them myself are we just throw the note to me or so we can talk about the differences are High School's First.  Okay, you want to go first I will point out the one thing that blows my mind is the fact that for prom and now you know, where is going to be for prom you guys get hotel rooms for like two nights and this is only senior year. Okay, but you still get no. No you did it for you at least got the hotel room for now just senior year but the seniors always do it. Yes, and the seniors does get hotel rooms for prom night and then after prom go back and like the  Higher senior class I'm guessing. Well, I would say like it's a good handful. Okay? Yeah. So a lot of people just party in a hotel like going between rooms and all that which is bizarre to me. It was bizarre to me. I did it one time but and you act like he was so normal. I was like no, I mean it seemed pretty I've never heard of anyone doing that. I felt like everyone did that's like the tradition I guess. I mean, yeah, so you go you go to prom then you go to this hotel room that we all all of us coordinated ahead of time. Like Hey, we're all going  to stay here the night and you get like four rooms if there's like or like yeah, there's a bunch of us. We all get a green we all like, you know hang out that type of thing and then we'd stay there for Senior Skip Day and then obviously think go to the beach like hang out one of my friends birthdays was that we had two birthdays actually that weekend so we celebrated the birthdays all hang out and then we go to school the next day, you know, it wasn't is your problem. It was the middle of the week. Well, no, it was like and I was during AP exams. So like Senior Skip Day is on that.  April something it's not a day that week. That's what I'm trying to get. Well it was in it's in the middle of April late April. I would Sue Ya AP exams. Not the middle of me hockey time, but never mind. Yeah. So like that's one thing the one thing that was weird to me about your school are not a not even your school more like your town. Oh God is that Rishi recently came down during the summer to my town. Yeah little backstory. I  I visited Stuart Florida any of you guys know what that is where that is. Probably not by Palm Beach. Anyway, yeah, it's it's beautiful but it's like right on the water which kind of like blows my mind how like you can like. Oh, we're 15 minutes from the beach in all directions. It seemed like what do you like you guys are connected by two Bridges, aren't you? Well, I mean  I mean, well, it's just like a bunch of we have the rivers like we have the Indian River. Yeah, and then we have the was it called International International Langley?  Another River - yeah, it's basically just another River but we have Rivers all like in interloping our town and so we have Bridges all over the place. Yeah. It was I know it's weird and all your houses are all very different to yeah. We are not cookie cutter House cookie cutters. We have cookie cutter houses. Well, I would say in my neighborhood there cookiecutter houses and I would say in some of my friends neighborhoods. Some of them are could get her but they have slight slight, you know differences would say but generally cook a week.  Like none of a few in some neighborhoods. Yes, but it's kind of almost rare almost like I didn't neighborhoods mainly are like Joey's and oh, yeah Connors like those. Those are the nicer neighborhoods. Yeah. We have those like those kind of cookie cutter houses the Golf Community type. Yeah, that's true. There are a lot of courses, they usually those but you know, I'd high school wise. I was very preppy yours was yeah, very white very preppy ours was  so we had three, excuse me. We had three like kind of I don't know. What is the what was the demographic of our County? We had three high schools? Okay sure. We had and the one we we had one that was super.  Like Farm, it was literally like the south of the county. Okay, and so you can say it was literally on a farm basically, okay very far. So and so like the other schools when it would come time to play them. They were the Bulldogs we would say they we someone we had like the TV show for like the school and they always had someone playing like a farmer or whatever be like  We're going to beat you guys this year or something like that Nate's character. Yeah, that was Sergeant Southfork that was meets character. So for you guys don't know what you're talking about. They have this thing on their local on they're not a local news, but they're like School news that they have this thing called Captain County will have the this character. He's like is a one of Nick's friends when I speak are now we'll have them on the podcast, but they do this thing where they like me.  These videos and they're very they're very Mimi videos very mean filled and they were specifically for like school events. So let's say there was a pep rally on Friday.  that Monday he would he would spend the previous week recording like on campus in his outfit of like  the school colors and he had so are our what what is it called? We were the Tigers. What am I your mascot mascot was a tiger so we had like tiger print or cheetah print like pants underneath his shorts too. And so you kind of dress up any had a captain's hat on and so you kind of dress up as his character and he was named captain County. It's just give these like you make these funny videos and be like, make sure to go to next week's pep rally.  On Friday at bullet seems so like weird and stuff like that. Like it seemed like you do something like that at our school you get beat up for that type of thing. Oh, no, he was the celebrity. Yeah, and I saw that wouldn't take pictures went to tailgate like a few weekends ago all those some people who like we're like two years younger than us. Yes, tell him. Oh my gosh, it's Captain Captain County. They're all their snap stories literally celebrity. The heck is going on like I think at our school like  You just had to like I don't even know what your know celebrities like now that they are now. Well now yeah an actual slab actual not to say that Blake is not actually like you are a celebrity but Blake is Captain County will have on the podcast soon speaking of snap streaks.  It's I don't even try to deny even starts a seg Segway. All right speaking of snap streaks.  What did you want to say? I don't even when you sit when he said segue at first. I thought you meant like the thing you write like the thing here. I knew it. I knew yeah, but I was like Segway like, okay. No. Yeah, no segue into snap streaks because that's why my staff speaks about those people that are taking. Oh snaps of yeah, and the end people are making Vlogs. Do you do in your friends do this on your Snapchat that they have personal Vlogs of their day if they do, I don't know about it because I don't want to okay, I would say a few of my friends.  Mainly girls have this their Secret Story. I guess you could say well and it's about private story. It's like a private story set to certain friends and I can view it and it's basically a vlog of their life or like one person doesn't like a lot of where it's her life and what she's doing every day and that type of thing. Does she she popular I mean like is he?  Killer, you really even mean it's on Snapchat. So no, I guess you can't really it's like her friends I listen to it. But some days it's funny how some days it's like this is with all them some days are funny and if it's of once in a while, I'll watch it. I think that's hilarious. But this girl does it like like 10 times a day type thing. Yeah. It's what she does it a lot and I love this person. But when she died when she does it, sometimes it's just like, oh my God, come on. I don't need a  You see that like that that the thing so I almost makes me want to unsubscribe from them all then again. Like I feel bad if I don't watch it. I wouldn't feel bad at all. I don't know why I do that. I just feel like I feel bad because like  I like you know, I'm like it should be obvious. When was the last time you talked to this person?  like  two days ago. You're joking. No. Okay real life you mean?  Or like to text I mean like through tax I would say like often okay, they're not even that's fine. Just like it's fine. Like really I was going to say because like some people will keep these streaks with people. They haven't seen they haven't talked to you in over a year. I'm talking I'm talking about like there's how many streaks right now do you have on your phone? I guarantee I have no more than to let me check right? You don't have one with me. That's a good reason. I have one.  Guess the number it's triple digits but a hundred 307. Oh my God, that's actually a lot it. Yeah anyways.  so  I don't understand.  See, I have 13 where some people they wake up. They take one snap. It'll be of like their dog. Yeah, and they just go down their list of like 40 people that they all they have like streaks with of like 50 or more something like that sure and they sent that's the only snap they'll send to him ever. It's just their their morning streaks, you know, well and I think it's bullshit because they we can  Yeah, you can say that you can tell what because you I don't understand the point to I don't understand why if you don't talk to this person. You don't make any interaction the most you ever get is sending them a picture of you getting ready for class. Yeah.  It's just not well, like I think it's like more of a sure if you don't talk this person like every day or something like that or not, like good really good friends with him, like best friends like you and Jet for example, but uh, like I don't you have a streak? No. Okay. So like if you guys had a streak but you guys don't talk very often, you know, because he lives in Flagler. I wouldn't be like I wouldn't be like, oh that's normal like because you guys are like really good friends. Yes. I'm the same way with I understand if you have streaks with people, who are they?  You talk to like pretty often whether or not it'd be like once a week. Yeah, but like there's there's some people they literally will never they I'll ask him be like, oh, when was the last time you either a hung out with them? Yeah or just like text. I'm like, hey, what's up? Just seeing what's up? Yeah, like oh maybe last year or something like mine. That's what I'm like, why do you still contact them like that know, some people have the streak just to say that they have like, that's the that's the only thing street that it's no one.  Cares. Yeah, I don't understand why people did it's just for their mental like that you feel important. I guess it's just for that celebrity feel I get these. So I send the same face I would say in different like positions and stuff like that. And sometimes I'll use these are like well, let me know if I'm doing it, right? Yeah. Yeah, that's literally it. No, but I send I send them individually so I don't I don't feel as bad. So they all slightly look different.  The same is it the same thing you're putting more effort into it to go through each named individual and I will say I want to make sure I click on everyone's name. Yes, and you acknowledge. You're not just seeing the flame symbol. Yeah. Exactly Emoji. Well, I don't just claims. I have Peach emojis. You're funny. You're cool things. I wish I was you you sound like one of my friends I would say that but like like you're not just only seeing that emoji not even reading the name. Yeah, and then hitting it in and keep on so  Typing I'm looking for more of them. Yeah, I mean, I just think it's like the thought that counts though that like I thought of it so like I like your right like that's the that's the reason why I do it because I'm like, okay I thought of you like, yeah. I read your name I clicked on your name. I sent this you acknowledge that you're sending a single picture to them and them alone. Exactly. It's not just  A newspaper that you're spreading across town exactly exactly. So like there's like an importance to some snaps. What was your highest streak you ever had? Probably about 3 o 7 if I were to guess it's no more than like three forty. See I had one over a thousand we lost it then I had full. Yeah, they've always been my fault. I think I think last year. I had one with one of my buddies in Tallahassee. It was like 700 it was  Like guys like it was like it wasn't good one. Like let me let me guess you spent the entire day with the person and therefore you wouldn't snap them. No, no, no. Okay. That's that's why I was doing finals and I was studying. Oh and he kept on sending me a bunch of snacks and you're like, I'm busy and I'm like, I'm like I can't talk right now. Like I did my phone was off and we lost it and he was mad at he's still mad at me. I'm sure to this day. If I don't I understand like being a little mad, but I can never hold a grudge over something like that. I don't think he'll do.  Gradually these kind of like jokingly like I agree. She lost the streak like that kind of know I had probably at least a 250 to 300 and it was probably more. I think I've had multiple like 200s with the same person and I keep losing it either because I'll just forget or something like that like finals or something like that. Yeah, or the one time we went to volcano Bay and I spent the entire day with the person.  And literally just when I'm with people I'm not going to send them. I'm not going to text something stand standing right next to me. Oh, yeah, people do that to me all the time. I think that's stupid unless it's like for a joke or whatever. It's also we were at a water park. We didn't have our phones on. Yeah for most of the time and so like we lost it and I was I was blamed for it too. And I'm like that was both of us. You can't blame that all along. It's like that one episode of the office when like and he's texting. I don't know. What's his name.  And the black guys named Darrell, that's their. Oh, yeah Darrell, like are you seeing this and they're like texting each other right next to each other. Yeah. It was it was like a subplot but that was that's what about reminded me of I've been having a lot of office memes and scenes coming up on my Spotlight on Insta and I hate it why it's just too much. It's always the same ones like which one's the gym pranks the  on your on your on like the tube like no no on Insta. Oh on your instance on your instant on the magnifying glass thing. It's called Spotlight, right? Yeah the meme page. Yeah. It just it's always comedians it. Well, it started recently Comedians and I love it because this is just always random different ones. Okay, but then the the office ones the same office since keep coming. I love that. I will watch a random office scene just like  I'll see you on YouTube and I'll go down the spiral. I hope I don't get killed or sent death threats for this but I never finished it because I didn't think I enjoyed it. You have a I watched up to like season 6 and then when is that before Michael f it was before because I didn't even know he left until someone thought. Wow. Okay, I see mean like that is the downfall of the series but you gotta watch the end. That's what I've heard. The ending is good. It's a good club. I've seen like scenes from like the ending scene.  It's like when so you like to watch wedding? Yeah, have you seen like, you know, Robert California? Yeah. Yeah, I know about him, but I've never I never got up to the point where he was in he has some and then he became the CEO or sand Will Ferrell. Yeah the hacky sack. Yeah. Oh, yeah. I love the the juggling the just Phyllis teach custody one last thing before we close or whatever. What are your YouTube recommendations like my  My recommendations are either don't look at it. Okay, if I can tell you right now off the top of my head. It's either Minecraft stuff for some reason and what else I got to read it off. I can't think because I keep on seemed like all right. Let me tell you. Let me Yuri years off really quick because I have a weird story about you to soccer stuff soccer stuff. Okay, that makes sense and a speed math competition. Mr. Hush against the calculator.  4.7. Is that like the guy is is a thumbnail the guy on the Whiteboard. It's a chalkboard. I haven't seen that one. Okay, nevermind. Not that I watch speed math competitions. Actually the ones I see no one man. I've seen that know my YouTube recommendations. Are you do you do this? This is a very personal thing. I don't think I've ever told anyone this it got really quiet at me. Everyone's listening good. So on YouTube when  I'm so when I get off Xbox or like when I'm done with homework, and I'm sitting in my bed getting ready to go to bed. You know how people go on YouTube and stuff like they would you do that. Right? I used to okay, I would literally sit on YouTube for like three hours a night. I sit on there now are like it's maybe for twice on there for like an hour or two, you know getting ready to go to bed. Yeah, like so he's entire Willam so I get tired and go to bed used to play a lot for me, but I'm on YouTube and I'll start watching something normal like something in my feet.  Like a vlog like the David dobrik flogged something like that or a watch like a let's play of the game or I'll watch like some like highlight thing like a sports highlight thing like well what re-watch like the magic ESPN stuff and then it turns into giraffes and koala bears cohabitate. Exactly exactly. I go down this spiral and I always end up in the same spot. Yeah square feet. No. Oh my God, that's a different podcast know. Okay, always.  It's really weird. Oh is it not seed relating know it's like it's something like never guess it probably. Okay. I'll tell you what it is. It's so it's not technically ASMR videos, but their hair cut videos of people get their people talking or is it like you just hear the noise of like just here? Yeah. So I guess it kind of is a Smo. That's I would say it is it's literally guy like guys and girls getting haircuts and like  shaves at like weird countries what it says dude that there's a multiple people that do it. So they go like they this guy gets like a like a shave at Route 66 by this really old dude and it's like a classic wet shave and then there's one that's like a Turkish shave and a haircut and there's an Indian there's an I don't know why you've never been in the obviously, but I don't know if you can say that I've uh, never mind obviously, but you white when you go to it.  You go there and you get the best one of the best things I would say about it. I've only been there twice, but the things I remember are there the haircuts there are weird. You know, why why is when you pay for a haircut? You also pay not by like not on accident but like you also pay for a massage so it what it's a haircut / massage. Okay. So the haircut they cut your hair.  R and then while they while they can check out your head like oil your face and stuff like that and in the he massages the guy or girl massage your face and gives you a head massage and in like like your back and like your hands and all that stuff.  And sorry and it's super super strange. Like it's very comfortable. It sounds really gross but it's really comfortable. Like I don't know. I haven't had in a while. But how would you know? Well, you know while you said I mean, yeah, because last time I won't you guys like 10, so the I've had it before I do Dawn is this done that what the hell but yes. I watched those types of like those have videos come on. And then I also like the the Chiropractic videos the ones where they click cracking all  Guys, I can't watch those. You can't watch those. I don't know. There's a kid. This is old guy that does it and he's just like he's like, oh if you like these you're a crack addict and I'm like, I'm definitely a crack addict. I you know, actually I'm not going to answer me take it's not contacts. I'm cracking. I'm a crack addict. No, that's a haircut and like a face massage like in a yeah, it's like it easy. I never the first time I ever went and got a haircut here in Orlando. The lady was like, oh let me  Shave your neck and let me massage your head or yeah, and I'm like no I get it. She shaved my neck without even asking but then she's like, oh you want to let me massage your head. I'm like, oh why like that like, I guess that's a normal thing. But apparently the neck shave was a normal thing to I had never gotten that before. Yeah. Well, I was I thought there's so many I mean, you know, it is spooky season what that will be well to talk about that in the next podcast we go, but ya know by my YouTube Red  Nations are so strange like that. Like I wonder tell me the audience tell me what you are. You're YouTuber text me because like technique if you're listening to this, you know, his number don't text me unless you want to know don't DM me any okay, so I think we're going to wrap up here anything you want to say.  Live long and prosper. Okay. This has been the roommate agreement. I'm Rishi and I'm Nick and catch us next time when we record episode 2.	The first episode of The Roommate agreement.

They might win a hundred and fifty games this season.  The a is as we all know going to be a force to reckon with in the in the west. So I mean we're over here plan our hearts out against just a brutal stretch to start the season. But I mean, I guess what are you at? You guys are like two and five. Like I said, you guys are also playing some quality organizations as well. So I think we need to hit the reset button and just have another opening day again. Just just reset start over send it back. I mean  To be fair. The entire league right now is like upside down. I'm so the whole league is freaking weird. It's all backwards. Yeah speaking of backwards Nate.  I like that lets go back. I'm all about the positions. I'm all on the transition King. Let's run through some some baseball history April 4th, April 4 as we are currently recording on here two o'clock in the morning on the East Coast 1911. The MVP award is introduced and sponsored by high huge arm Chalmers huge home nurse an auto manufacturer the first winners of the MVP.  Selected by vote of one baseball player writer representing each franchise in the league will be Tigers outfielder Ty Cobb and Frank Schult of the Cubs 1948 before an exhibition game in Orlando. This one's wild Hayes manager Connie Mack who is 84 years old challenges Clark Griffith the 78 year old owner of the Senators to a foot race from third blade Third Base to home plate.  The participants enter the Florida field in an ambulance before starting their contest which ends in a photo finish tie. What you find is you find some very strange it is so unbelievably entertaining imagine going to a ballpark and seeing two ancient old guys. Just taking a solid 45 seconds to run from third to home. That's a that be fun. That's great in-game entertainment.  Married, they're answered in an ambulance. I don't even understand that. I need some more back story on that. It's crazy 1974 in a crowd in front of a crowd of 50 mm at Riverfront Stadium on opening day in Cincinnati. The ol Hank Aaron ties Babe Ruth's all time record of 714 home runs by hitting a two-run homer off a jack Billingham. The Atlanta front office had considered keeping hammerin Hank.  On the bench during Road game. So the Slugger could try to equal the mark in front of his hometown fans, but commissioner Bowie Kuhn ordered the Braves to put the outfielder in the lineup for at least two of the three games against the Reds. So you knew he's going to hit it two or three games, but like commissioner calling the shots right in the lineup for you.  Yeah, what is that? That's a little this little much overstep boundaries. They're real and staying in Cincinnati fast forwarding all the way to 2003 new Great American Ballpark. Sammy Sosa becomes the first Latin American player and 18th overall to hit 500 home runs. Slammin. Sammy reaches a milestone in the seventh inning when he drives a scout Sullivan 1 2 pitch into the right-field seats.  So that's pretty cool first Latin American definitely cheated a lot. But I think that's a pretty proud moment for my I'd say  Yeah, no kidding and speaking of Sammy Sosa Ronald Acuna getting an extension eight years a hundred million dollars. What do we think about this beautiful a freaking steel for the Braves? No. Yeah. No, I mean should I thought my initial thought was like  Dude, just hold out a little while in collect a bigger check, but but but here's the thing. How many guys have we seen and again? No, not again. I haven't said this yet. How many guys how many guys have we seen come up who've had maybe like had one maybe two good years that are just kind of followed by mediocrity or there's a yeah bit of a plateau.  Not to say that they fall off but they level out and they're not able to replicate that first season or season and a half or whatever it is. So, I mean I see why a young kid like that would be eager to get a deal done because not only is he getting the money? Well, he's getting he's getting what your projected to do money as well as the security. Yeah. I mean, the guy doesn't even have 30 career home runs yet.  So right I'm so I see both ways. So you're seeing you're saying steel but at the same time that's a lot of money for someone who hasn't really done anything yet. Yeah, like that's probably the best way to put it like yeah, the Braves definitely got away with a great deal here, but I think for him not a bad night about so I mean, obviously if he's able to continue at the pace that he started out at he would be worth.  'The well more than a hundred million but knowing what we know and not knowing what we don't know Woody. Why do I feel like you're Michael Scott right? Sometimes I just start a sentence and I don't even know where it's going. Let's hope that I find it along the way no, but for knowing what we know now knowing what we know and knowing and  Not knowing what we don't know about this kid. Good deal for him in my opinion. Yeah. Good deal.  As of right now, I guess you could say I think it's a little early but very early here. I'll break down the deal a little bit for you. Apparently this guy's been making money for a while. He was signed at 16 years old Grant it was only for a nice a only $100,000 but like, you know in the grand scheme of things is not a whole lot but for a 16 year-old from you know, you know poverty that's not know. What kind of big bucks you're making over there. It's really not a hundred k  So the deal looks like this, let's see. So you're one of the extension obviously would be next year. So 2020 we making a million dollars and you would have been making 560 K. So not a huge upgrade but a little bit of a bump in your to which is your 2021 making five million then the year after that. We'll go all the way up to 15 million dollars.  Years four and five will be making 17 million years six and seven. He will also be making 17 million dollars each year. And those are actually his first two years of what he would have been eligible free agent. So 17 Mill, you know, who knows and at that point it could seem like a little bit of a low Ball but the club option sets in for the last two  Um and also set at 17 million dollars for those Club option years and if they don't pick him up, it is a ten million dollar buyout. So total could be ten years and a hundred and twenty four million dollars sounds like so poof man. I think that is your will be 31 but a time that's over. Yeah, sorry 3031 like that. So I mean even if he is an absolute freak of nature at that point.  He's only 31. You can still go get more paper right after that. So.  yeah, I think it's a win for him because paid now and eventually we're making double digit million dollars a year youngest player in baseball history to Sonic contract worth at least a hundred million dollars, so  Our guy cunha making history. Yeah. Yeah, and you know, I did see that even with this the Braves are like second. I think they're second to last and ALR NL East as far as payroll goes so I'm kind of curious to see how this year will end up, you know, if they don't do what they did last year. I'm curious to see if they start spending a little more money. So here's my question for you.  You mentioned money because they got this guy for what we and I'm sure a lot of other people think is a bargain.  Why have they not shifted their focus which maybe they have who know who really knows what goes on behind closed doors? Why have keuchel and Kimbrel not been signed whether it's I mean both of them, that's a stretch. But yeah why I have not either one of those guys been followed up with that deal knowing that they saved significant money with this deal Kimbrel sounds like a no-brainer for me for the Braves especially since you know, he  I started there. I mean it makes sense to me, especially like I said, they don't spend they have plenty of money to work with they haven't spent a lot. They need a back-end help, you know, they need some backing up in the bullpen, but truthfully Beyond right every team needs Bull Pen help right now. It seems like yeah everyone does but truthfully I'm gonna go on and lemon in say that both keuchel and Kimbrel  End up signing in the NL East that's kind of my my gut feel on this. That's a solid thought. I feel like things are I feel like things are pretty level there in the NL East for a handful of teams. And I feel like any slight Advantage you can give yourself. Yeah might be which is you to the top. I did see that there's some rumors that the Mets are still talking to keuchel and I mean, we're talking two teams for a perfect fit for for Kimbrel. It's Braves and  Please you know, I mean I think David Robertson is a good back-end option, but I don't see him as a top-end closer. So I think the Phillies could probably add one more guy. I don't know if they got the room for it as far as cap goes or money in general. But yeah, I think both amend up and then released and I think that's going to be a very tight division obviously already is speaking of a division.  That will presumably be tight.  That will not include this team the American League East the Blue Jays making a couple moves in recent days shipping Kevin Pollard the Giants. Can we just talk about how random this was random timing random random trade spot with the Giants. Yeah. It didn't make sense to me. But da me and honestly, I'm kind of glad that  Guys, no longer roaming center field in the AL East. No kidding that guy can track a baseball down just as good as anybody climbing walls and stuff. I don't know dude, Ramon. Laureano might be like the best center fielder in baseball. It's not named Mike Trout here in a couple of years. Maybe even like this year.  Dude, is this yes done? And I know we're off my dad engine here, but I just feel like I had to mention it because I've been watching the past few nights throughout Bogaerts two games in a row first night was it was at home plate last night or yeah last night was it? Well, I guess two nights ago for people listening to it now ya got me pegged out Bogaerts at third trying to lay out a triple dude is unbelievable and that part  Is not exactly tiny. Yeah, so that he can just like manage that real estate out there the way he does do to stud. Yeah. He poked one out and he poked on out in tonight's game. So did he? I don't know man. Yeah, it's he's looking he's looking real good. Well if he said balls out of Pub ballpark, he's probably going to end up being a better hitter and Kevin pillar. This surprised me a little bit when I pulled his career line to 60 to 90.  Seven and 396 look obviously, not your number one option at the plate, but I think but I think at this trade happened outside of the AL East which is obviously both of our, you know, favorite teams Division. I don't think I would care about it that much it just seems like yeah like the return wasn't that great for the Blue Jays. Yeah. I mean they did get they got a solid.  Jim prospects one De Paula. Yeah, I guess I am he's like their number and he was a Giants number 19 Prospect. I got Derek law another picture and they got infielder out Alan Hansen. Yeah. I mean, I don't I don't know aside from De Paula. What kind of return those two are going to bring? Yeah, but yeah, just like a super low-key. It just seemed like a very like housekeeping type of move where it's like  You need to shift some things around or whatever, right? I don't think there is any drama like any drama with him because if I feel like he was loved by that organization in the fan. Yes, I agree and that guy hustled his butt off. I mean every day from what it seems like the only thing I can think of is that I did see that looks like Centerfield was now going to be plugged up by Anthony Alfred who is Toronto's 11th ranked Prospect. Maybe he's just killing it and enable.  all right now and  I don't know. I mean, well he did tear it up in a ball but they they recalled him from Triple-A. Yeah, so he must have shot up pretty quick. Yeah, and they're so he might be the guy the future at least in Center for them. So we'll see ya maybe I mean, it's the I guess you're right though. It's just random timing weird for it being the first week if I'm Kevin floor. I'm probably rubbed a little bit the wrong way.  Like, you know, I've been I've been working my butt off. I've been chasing down fly balls Robin home runs for you for years, and you couldn't at least trade me in spring training at the trade me after we already had opening week.  Weird. Yeah, very strange and they were interviewing them. I guess the day of the trade and as you'd imagine is very emotional and he kind of wrapped it up saying that this is all he's ever known which is very true. Like yeah Roman the outfield for the Toronto Blue Jays is quite literally what we think of when we think of Kevin pull our so yeah, very very random the timing of it just seemed  Very strange which makes you think that maybe there was something going on but like we said there couldn't possibly have been anything with this guy but like you said just with it being a week or two after spring training just seemed very very strange. But another move that the Blue Jays have made I'd mentioned they had made a couple as they extended Randal grichuk five years 52 million dollars.  He was set to be a free agent after the 2020 season. So getting rid of one outfielder and extending another how do we feel about this particular move again? I'm a little pissed if I'm Kevin pillar, but I mean, I don't know Randal grichuk doesn't really jump off the page as far as productivity goes. I think he's a good outfielder. I think he can he can eventually become a pretty decent hitter.  Um good for him getting a paycheck obviously, but I still think because of the size of the paycheck. It's not too bad of an extension. I think it's still treatable if the right offer comes along for the for the Blue Jays, you know, I think who's to say it won't be a contender in a couple months. It's going to be like, hey, let's go grab it, you know if they have an out there it goes down or they're looking for depth in the Outfield.  And they just go now him from the Blue Jays but I don't know. I'm confused by what the GM is doing and when he's doing it right now, I wouldn't be extending anybody right now from the Blue Jays. Well, they don't really have much going on beyond the season because grichuk is actually one of two players. I saw this note earlier today. He's only one of two players with guaranteed money beyond the season for the Blue Jays so  Their future is a little up in the air right now. I mean, obviously you got you got vladi you got vladdy jr. And bichette and guys like that but beyond that like there's not  I mean if they're real brother, yeah, yeah like yeah. Yeah. Yeah, if they're if they're putting a puzzle together, the pieces pieces aren't really coming together all that smoothly right now. I'm not I'm not seeing it. That's what I'm saying. I mean you bring up you bling up vladdy Junior like I'm questioning is you know, what's going on with the Blue Jays as far as like their decision-making at it's very strange. It's like to me.  If we're going to have a wash of a year if we're pretty much throwing in the towel for this year.  Let's one not extend anybody to give the respect of trading, you know, wondering most tenured guys at a decent time in the offseason or in spring training and three if it's a wash call up your studs and let him get some big league time. If you're going to start to make a run in the next couple of years. These guys are going to need experience. Let them play like it. I don't understand what's going on in Toronto, man. They're not doing  The right way, it seems like yeah, I'm not seeing them making a run in the next couple of years. I would say like minimum at least three. I mean they have very good to have a guy mean they're ranked very high with their prospects. So right but you just like you have to give them time and like they're not. Yeah, they like me to come up right out of the gate and just great on all cylinders. It just right work like that. Yeah. I mean, it's just let it  sell some tickets people are getting want to go watch vladdy get some TV rights because that's going to want to be televised like  Get him up there and stop man SeatGeek. It's the answer to all your ticket needs. Are you looking for tickets? Do you have plans with friends or family to make it to an upcoming game or concert?

Yeah, I'll buy my to you will fly up there in order to do that. Yeah, I need to get those tickets. But yeah wrapping up the Blue Jays talk.  That about does it let's move right along to the the main topic of the show your favorite guy. We not going to talk about this guy. No quite seriously. This is like your favor guy now, I think you're all I think you're all in on on our guy Bryce. I'm not in on him. I think he's a giant douche. You texted me the other night and said hey,  Were you were eating it up? I am I'm entertained. I was entertained by all the Antics. You've got your you've got your light blue throwback Harper Jersey on its way in the mail right now as we speak don't you man? I I really really don't like him but I can it's like I can't take my eyes off you love him that series you love him and you I got nothing on you love what he's doing to the Nationals.  Right. Now I got sucked in. I don't know how I feel about it. It was just entertaining. That's all. I know. He really was. He's basically hitting a thousand right now in his return to Washington and his return to Washington because he I believe you went 2 for 2 in the second game today and he was 3 for 5 in the first game with two strikeouts against Max Scherzer. So basically he went three for three because nobody gets a hit off Max Scherzer truth, even though technically he's  Go into to start the season but we're not going to talk about that. We're not going to talk about the 2019 and I'll saw young like that. But all that to say how do we feel about Harper's return? So if we're talking about let's see today, right we're talking about one was to we're going to break this down. And yeah, so to keep it simple because it's to 26 in the morning here and hit my days are all out of sorts.  Sorts, let's just go first game second game.  For the Neighbors game first game was bat flip game and I feel like second game. He should have got your hold.  He should have got buzzed. I'm not gonna lie to you Nate. I'm not here to talk about the second game.  I'm here to talk about.  Bryce Harper returning to Washington and essentially dismantling the organization single-handedly. I'm surprised the Nationals did not fold.  Okay, here's what I asked you if if they had cheered when he first came up his first baby if they would have cheered. Do you think he would have been a little less of a jerk? Oh absolutely a thousand percent because if you know guys if you notice the parts where he got do she like with the his first hit getting a double you're getting the double like wave in sarcastically and then obviously the  bat flip all that stuff happened like much deeper into the game. It wasn't like right out of the gate and they had been on him the entire game like I guess like I said, he had those two strikeouts against Scherzer and they let him have it so, you know, you know, he was saving that up. I think here's what I'll say about the waving thing. I think that is like they're a little there a little thing they do when they hit doubles. So I think I saw in spring training so it's not like I don't think that was directed.  Sit out the Nationals it but it didn't help it didn't help dump, you know rubbing alcohol into an open wound speaking of which there's so many things right now. I feel like okay not so many that was an exaggeration. There's like two things that are going on surrounding Bryce Harper that like, I feel like there's two sides of the baseball world where like one side knows about it and the other side doesn't so like perfect example right there the waving thing if that is in fact like their thing didn't know it another right?  You know buddy people in the right field thing, right? Yes, the Bowing thing that's what I was going to say. The other thing the Bowing thing nobody seems to understand that he did that in Washington. Like, it's It's Gettin It's Gettin old like I see all these which really confuses me because you got these like accounts like assaulted a or I guess it would have been during the game like MLB like their Twitter account tweeted out the video of it of him doing his bow, and he's like  And there were like, he brought the Bryce bow to enemy territory and I like quote tweeted and I was like, yeah. No, that's literally where it originated. You can't bring something to a place where it originated and like nobody seems to understand the like, what is it? What's up with this new tradition? I'm like, he's literally been doing this. Where have you all been? I don't ya I don't get so what was the timing of that by the way, when did the bow happen? I honestly don't know because like a like I've said on here before I'd been going to like a bunch.  Of nats games and I when I was home visiting no, no, I mean like in relation to timing in that game specifically. Oh specifically in that game. Yeah. I'm not sure. I feel like it was late and there was like only Phillies fans left. That's what I feel like. Well, no the only fans that were out which I don't know if you saw that but like the only fans that were out in right field, we're all Phillies fans because they like bust a bunch of people down from Philly and they left they basically bought out all the tickets.  In right field and that was like all the other big thing. I saw like the dudes wearing the white t-shirts that said trade. Yeah. I did see that the first row, but okay, so maybe it was early then the with the bow, but either way I ate it up man. I can't even lie. I ate it up. It was super entertaining. I'm sure they're everyone that's listening right now is like sick of hearing about Bryce Harper. I'm not me. I'm I'm team Bryce now to heck.  The Nationals you freaking blew it. You can't even be salty right now. Like it's not his fault your organization low-balled him and you're all that and for all the people that are saying we didn't lowball and we offered him like three hundred million dollars. Yeah, the definition of a lowball means you underpay and you don't meet the other number that somebody else is trying to offer said person if Elly's offered him three hundred and thirty million dollars. That's a lowball and  And a hundred million of that was deferred so he wasn't getting it right away. Yeah, dude was going to be in like a retirement home collecting the check from the Nationals. So I don't think many people want to do that. Sorry exactly. So it's not when you're waiting out free agency to sign a biggest deal of all time, which he obviously was we talked about this already. But yeah, no that was definitely a little bald the national screwed up.  And I ate up these last two days. I think it was entertaining. I think the bat flip was a little much but I think if I get booed if I get booed for basically  The Nationals basically started when Bryce Harper came up. Nobody cared about the Nationals before he came up. Wow, really disrespecting Ryan Zimmerman right now. I am a huge fan of Ryan Zimmerman, but he wasn't a superstar and Stephen Strasburg granted. He just I don't know what he is right now, but he's on like his 18th arm surgery but had like a massive star power when he came up. I think Bryce Harper put the  is on the map and  when you go back, I think I can't totally disagree with some of the stuff. He did after getting booed because douchey but I can't totally disagree with it. I'm all for it man. That baffle it was nuts. I'm here for it. I know I've been on the fence past couple episodes and yeah like Bryce, but this isn't nope. I'm on board with Bryce. I do not like him. I extremely love the fact that he's  Meaning the enemy of you know, like the villain of baseball.  And and I like it. I like that that people are hating the Phillies again because they're relevant. I think it's fun. In fact, I'm so on board with Bryce Harper right now here. I'm going to sign up for season tickets for next season. Can you save $20 off your season ticket purchase?  Give me like 10 grand.  2020 season tickets now, but seriously I'm here for it the national like sorry your fans like the fans frauds like all you people that were booing like pissed that he that he was left you all were the same people that were like in the off season before you signed all we hit like 249 last season. I hope he's gone like yeah a bunch of how you rotten all T So bunch of frauds. I  Learned a lot about my hometown's fanbase that night bunch of frauds. I will say there there were there were some that stood up and applauded as I was hoping there'd at least be some  but the it was there was no question that it was more booze than cheers when he walked up. Yeah, stay salty Washington frauds. But anyway, yeah that bat flip. I'm here for it his he's like the villain of baseball now. Yeah, man can like move over. I like having a villain. Is it? Well now there's this there's a legitimate question. Is he now the villain of baseball?  Now that mannequins just out there posted up in Sunny San Diego like yeah, obviously, he's got his own back like his own like history that people aren't going to forgive him for which I get but now that Bryce is like in the in the Limelight here in Philly. Yeah. That's the perfect word. You said Lima. It's because the Phillies are relevant. I mean the the San Diego Padres are not relevant and that's why it's hard to make mannequin that the  The Filling I think Bryce Harper is the villain right now.  You just racking up quote cards right now. Put it up babe. I can't wait right on drugs at the villain of baseball. Yeah, did you see what I like speaking of the bat flip? Did you see what Mike Rizzo said the Nats GM know, what do you say they're like asking him what his thoughts were and he was like you hit the ball that far you do whatever the hell you want. I love it. Dude. The NASA Phillies rivalry is is at yeah at its height.  Right now and I am here for it. Yeah, I'm going to be it's gotten me. I'm a little more attracted to the NL right now considering the AL is so freaking weird right now, but I am I mean it up man. I can't not look.  Speaking of another quote. Did you any any chance? You saw it? Ryan Zimmerman said so like this is the most Ryan Zimmerman quote that there could be they kind of asked him about the whole like Bryce drama and he said nobody did anything wrong. There are no bad guys in this it's okay. Everyone can be happy these days. It's hard not to make something out of everything but you don't have to Bryce is not the first MVP to switch teams. This happens. He came.  He played he exercised his right sounds like any business anywhere.  That's just is that that not just it's just the best what a guy he's just the best and they like he's from Virginia Beach and like the article was like in his most Virginian gentlemen way possible thousand percent fines and resemble said this what a guy you can't ya can't hate Ryan Zimmerman, you really can't but guys yeah Class Act, but then you got friggin on the other side. You got Mike Rizzo being like our organization sucks our staff.  Ducks do whatever the hell you want. Could you give up a tater that far let them launch the bat as far as he wants? Yeah speaking of haters. That was an actual home run not this quote-unquote Moon shot that went 10 rows deep and Citizens Bank. I'm sorry. What was the distance and he was like 480 wasn't it? Yeah. I was not 480. It was in the second deck a went for 58.  Might as well been 480. In fact, I think they said it was which I didn't I didn't think this was accurate and I might have to go back and double check myself. I think they said it was his furthest or know his second for this home run at Nationals Park. That's a little surprising. But I think if you add in the distance of the bat flip, you'll get to 480.  1,000% I actually had somebody like I put up that Instagram story about what are your thoughts on the bat flip? Whatever. I got some I got some good responses. One of the person are one of the responses was this is an MLB the Show bat flip. He probably had this one in his back pocket for that moment as probably what they were doing. That's probably what took him. So long to sign a deal with you is spending all of his time it freaking MLB the Show HQ trying to figure out bat flip said he was going to do and  That was it was dirty dude in there like glance over to the Nationals Dugout after he did it. Whoo-hoo cold man went to one of the other responses was KD 2.0 snake Emoji. I love it. I love it. We have a villain and it's fun. I'm just glad it's not a Yankee dude. I'm just ready to see this rivalry. Just take off. Oh my I need an ear hole. I need some Chin Music next.  Time they play. Yeah, but who's gonna who's gonna chin whole chin whole it's late dude. It's 2:40 in the morning. Who's gonna hear whole Harper? Like, I mean, it's one thing for fans to hate him, but I find it hard to imagine or like I find it hard to see anybody on that staff. So I'll just need a little buzz man. I don't need actual context here. I don't need an HP P, but I do need  Little bit of give move your feet up under your hands kind of stuff.  I need that. I need to bring back Papelbon.  Yeah, you would be a good one. Let him take the mound in the late Innings one day contract.  Hey guys.

Show let's transition into some best and worst. Shall we?  Let's do it Bud best. And worst for this week is backyard baseball players not named Pablo Sanchez or Pete wheeler because what fun would that be? Yeah, that's the rules. In fact, I won't even need a third point for my best. I would just say give me Pablo give me Pete.  Leave the rest of the roster blank leading us off here wrong. Worst best. Let's go worse.  All right, lead us off here.  Marquis du boy. Yeah our guy with the goofy overalls and no shirt underneath  What are you doing? It's a what are you to suggest that you too sophisticated for our guy Marquis? What does that look that is that's not the one he's not my guy. I'm gonna go Maria Luna. She was the definition of a waste of space. She was the example of me understanding why coaches and little league put like the worst kid out in right field that because that's exactly if for whatever reason she was on my team.  I would just stick her in right field because she was literally just a waste of space. Yeah, sorry tracking any balls down. Never. Sorry Maria. What are you guys doing? We're going to go with our guide Dmitry petrovich. Sure. He's on your list. Remember his voice if they're yes if there was any work if there was any backyard baseball player who knew the war calculations for every other player in the game.  He is the brine to mention a tree better image is the bride candy of backyard baseball my God quote grab that it what a connection. Oh my God, if you put that up, you'll be my best friend for life. I will put that up. I will I will make a note number two for me Aamir Khan the younger brother of achmad Khan. Yeah. What up?  Bum, yeah, he literally swung a toothpick. Like if you if you remember that game his Bat was so skinny. It was like a wiffle ball bat. I'm like dude get a new bat. Yeah suck. No. Hmm. Sorry. I'm not holding any punches with my worst. Hey, I mean, we're not really hurting anybody's feelings are a bunch of bums cartoon. So well, you never know their family might be listening. Who knows.  Lisa Crockett  Man, you're really going after the Nerds man and all this all this promotion. We do for the Geeks of SeatGeek. Super nerdy. We throwing them under the bus super nerdy super nerdy. Sorry her song sucked. She sucked. I don't want her anywhere near my roster.  Speaking of songs are guy Pablo. Did you know the like secret about that like his little intro, you know how I like spoke Spanish apparently, like if you held down like shift or the spacebar something he spoke English.  Really like one of the like Easter eggs of the game or something was kind of weird. I'm sure at this point everybody knows about it, but you love to hear it. Love to hear it. Lastly for me. I'm going Sydney Weber / Ashley Weber combo the twins. Oh the twins just a couple of ditches did sigh whatever the plural of ditches.  They were just the were like they probably accounted if they were ever on my team. They probably counted for like 95% of the errors that were made in the field. They had a total batting a combined batting average of like zero just the like why even put them in the game. Like I know you have to have like bad players to make the better players look good. But like they're just on a completely different level. There's the way  To be a waste of space times 2 times 2. Yeah, they created dumb blondes for this game. Like it's not what you want. Now what you want to see they remind me of White Chicks honestly exactly best for on best.  You already mentioned this last name. I'm going to older brother Achmed Khan preach.  That guy was impossible to strike out would never K up.  Definitely the man is younger brother sucked. He's on my list too. And I can I can see his swing in my head. He had the like he literally swung down at the ball and would get so much backspin on the ball that it would lose a realize it would literally go like 600 feet all rise. All right, let's not make that connection. Oh, actually I honestly didn't even try to do that. I'm sure you're trying to save I swear on is the Aaron judge of  Baseball whatever whatever actually thinking more of more of How I Met Your Mother truthfully. Whatever. I'm going Mikey Thomas dude was just like a big nugget rolling around like a big Butterball, but dude could swing the stick. He live you want to talk about strange bat sizes. Aamir Khan was swinging a toothpick Mikey Thomas literally swung a telephone pole.  I don't know how a kid that age had the strength to swing such a large piece of material, but he did it and he did it. Well, all right bow, I'm gonna I'm gonna help you out a little bit because I know we probably have the same best player. So I'm going to go it I'm going to go I'm going to replace my one and two so I'm going to say that my next one is Kenny kawaguchi.  my man in the wheelchair  absolute throwing gems no matter what know that guy, huh? I said no kidding. Oh man. I'm glad you agreed because I was like, that's I mean, I no one can forget that guy always on the bump no matter what always known to man. So you're really you're taking the pitching route for your best. I am I'm strictly offense for my best and I'm going Keisha Phillips, that's mine. There. It is. Literally I'm convinced.  If you were to do the math home run at least eight swings out of 10 and she had straight burners when you didn't hit one out. No kitty, like shout out to Backyard Baseball for being ahead of their time not stereotyping like, oh she's an extremely large human being she's probably slow. No psych. She's actually like one of the fastest in the game. So shout out to Backyard Baseball for really like I said really being ahead of their time breaking down barriers breaking down.  Barriers just eliminating stereotypes across the board. I love it.  I love it kid this great. You stole it. I'm glad I gave it to you to finish this out what Allis I think we nailed it. Okay, so to be hard to disagree with our list.  Yeah, although people might be upset with you that you went Kenny over Keisha. But like I said, if you're taking the pitching route you like you can't do much better than Kenny like no, that's what I'm saying. Now, it's Sling It Keisha was my number one, but you know, like I didn't want to I kind of wanted to go before you but I wanted you to take it from me. I wanted you to let us know I wanted you to be the one to speak it let everybody know that Keisha is  Serve it appreciate it. Well that wraps up best and worst.  Let's see we got anything else here  Nope, that about does it. Let's see if I can bear. Let's see if I can remember. Well that wraps up what we talked about. I'm going to flip it over to you for what they're not talking about. Yes. I got it good little twang on that. Well, well things not being talked about. Mr. Terry. Francona has received a contract extension through the year 2022 of the top records in baseball from The Years 2013 to 2019.  Cleveland ranked second with a 562 win percentage 59 year old manager looks to lead the Indians to their first World Series Championship since 1948. Next up Trevor. Rosenthal is roof currently sitting with an era of infinity.  literally not an actual number  Infinity he has yet to record an out this year and has let up 5 earned runs killing the game in 2019 Trevor attaboy. How do you how do you have three appearances and not have a single out that is so painful to read her mind Marquez has reportedly agreed to a five-year 43 million dollar deal with the Rockies that includes a mutual option if he has to top three finishes in the sigh Young voting.  That's in the NL in League with same league with Max Scherzer and Jacob degrom.  So good luck with the mutual option. I guess the absolute Legend Bobby Cox is apparently suffered a stroke 77 year-old for time manager the year led the Braves to five world series over 25 years managing and I think I think we all know this guy's tough as nails. So please get better soon. Skip as soon well, I mean I got a mix this again.  This in honestly because we trash Zack Greinke quite a bit. We're all about identified on this podcast I do so, I'm gonna give him a little bit give a little shout out. We're definitely haters. But if you guys didn't know Tuesday,  This dude struck out 10 Padres and hit to taters.  Whoa, and we'll shout out to my boy Joe Diaz. I'm sure he is just loving the fact that I'm reading this because he texts me every time a pitcher goes yard because he loves the NL and he hates the fact that we like th he's been messaging me like every time somebody somebody goes deep you too, and he's like trying to convince me. He's trying to like get me to switch sides. I'm like I can I'm sorry. Oh God Joe you suck man. Well last  One this one this one hurts my heart a little bit bud.  It appears Trey Turner as suffered a broken finger after being hit in the hand attempting a button Tuesday's game the 25 year old led the league last year with 43 stolen bases and played all 162 games at shortstop for the Nats. What Exodia aimer? Yeah. Hopefully young stud doesn't miss too much time because  we both like them and honestly, I don't think we can talk about any players that we like anymore because they either get hurt or no longer play. Well, so yeah. Yeah, but didn't we just  Then we talked and we just get done talking about how like oh, this is this is his year baby. This is his team. It sucks. Dude. He just said he was gonna become the face of the Nationals like we're talking about him getting the keys to the White House. Wow, being the leader of the Free World like and then he goes down with a broken finger. What?  What are we doing here? Super awesome, super rough, super rough. You know, what else is rough Nate? Hmm. We just got done talking about backyard. Base Point. What's rough is looking like a character from backyard baseball?  Do you know who looks like a character from Backyard Baseball that I just realized watching this Red Sox A's series who Chris Davis Nate Chris Davis looks like Stephanie Morgan.  from backyard  Oh wow.  Yeah, I see that a little bit.  I'm sending you this Trisha's thing.  I got a side by side here yet a side by side that you're texting me.  You already create this I did I put it up on the IG story.  The hair is perfect. That's funny. I'm sorry. I'm still taking Stephanie Morgan over Chris Davis and a draft. I got it Staters though. Well, Stephanie Morgan Can field a ground ball and blow bubbles at the same time. So that is there an ignite bubbles. What a stud. Anyway, how about does it for me? Oh, actually I got my own little what's not being talked about when  It's actually really just a list of things that I feel that I need to share. I know I mentioned you today in the process of whipping up some mannequin stickers. Yeah themed Padres colors throwback Padres colors. It's gonna be nice Brown yellow and orange. So hope to have those sometime in the near future. We will see time will tell need that.  Again, speaking of a member of the A's making the connection here with mannequin. I was thinking about another guy whose name I'd really love to get into the into the mix here. We talked about him with during the draft. He's currently on my squad Stephen piscotty. I'm thinking he's officially now Steven spaghetti. So we're going to we're going to get that into the mix as often as we can. Hopefully he makes some some headlines from time to time so we can really  Work that in we can't even say his last name. So it's definitely spaghetti Stephen speak. I don't even know what his last name is. His last name is spaghetti and lastly here. No, I had two more things. I had a prediction when I was pulling my notes together for the Braves. I know we'd kind of alluded to it a little earlier. I'm going to say that Kimbrel is signed by end of day Saturday.  Really with the Braves? No, not necessarily the Braves just in general just signed because I think mistakenly I think a number of these teams that are like in the pooper right now are going to hit the panic button being like, all right. We're one in 10. Maybe we should figure it out.  And I think they sign them.  I like it bold just my thought and lastly here forgot to give a shout-out last episode but had to had to throw out the old alma mater seeing you baseball. They're currently number one in the nation heard about that. Dude III World. Shout out to those guys.  The squad just dicing it up on the diamond best in the nation just had to show him some love. But anyway that does it for me. You got anything else? That's it, man. I can't top that. That's it's good way to end it well in that case. That'll do it for us.

spotify:episode:5MjWIXQui5jEwupVysBN4E	The fact that Hillary Clinton ran a piss-poor campaign in 2016 is not enough to just say well she ran a poor campaign and look what we got. Yeah, you know she ran a poor campaign took Black Folk for granted thought, you know appearing with LeBron and a couple of selfies would Beyoncé and Jay was enough that wasn't enough and you didn't turn folk out but what I also tell people is when you decided not to go it wasn't just getting Trump for years. It was getting close now to 200 Federal.  Judge appointments that will affect not only you have was the lot of not just your children, but potentially your grandchildren now and Trump said the other day and we got a lot of them in the pipeline so that in and of itself should be enough to get your ass up get registered and then go vote that day. I'm amazed at the people who register but then on Election Day, you know, they get tired. They show his own they gotta get their hair did all them things come.  man  So I'm an old-school bet Watcher. I just start watching BT at the very beginning but I got in on it early enough. Thanks to Grandma's cable package to be exposed to video. So with Donnie Simpson Teen Summit with Ananda Caribbean rhythms, and also be tnews some folks grew up with Peter Jennings even older folks had Walter Cronkite. There was also Tom Brokaw me I grew up watching are Gordon. He not only became the face of  T news but he also had an hour-long show called conversations with egg Gordon it Gordon was conducting critical thoughtful interviews with super famous black newsmakers and celebrities long before it became fashionable to do. So on a national platform. He sat down with Tupac, which if you have never seen this interview YouTube it because Aunt Gordon as he often did put on an interviewing clinic now many times a according to beat out his competitors to score some of the biggest gifts.  In our business, he got the very first interview with OJ Simpson after he was acquitted a double murder long before Gayle King, and yes, we'll be talking about her in a moment. He grilled are Kelly in an interview that still to this day resonates and it was right after the tape surfaced of our Kelly urinating on the young woman after that became public Ed. Gordon is one of the finest journalist ever produced and he's got a new book out right now called conversations.  Black where he talks to some of the most important and influential thought leaders Stacey Abrams Angela ride Charlamagne Tha God Killer Mike TI and even yours truly. I don't know. Maybe it's Detroit. We just produce some incredible journalists because it also is from yes, the three one three anyway enough rambling for me coming up next your favorite journalist. Favorite journalist it Gordon on Jamel Hill is unbothered.  So I have to say it you're the first guest I've ever had on this show that this particular thing on your resume. I'm sure nobody else that I interview will have this on a resume and shout out to one of my producers for finding this beautiful nugget tidbit this tidbit and circle the word beautiful because in 1996 you were on people's most beautiful or named one of the 50 Most Beautiful People by people. Yeah, man.  That's a hell of a no. I really didn't it really they were at 49 and they were tired and they were just like who can't just happened to be there. There's like do you mind if we put you on this you're a serious journalist. You have been your significant thought leader critical thinker you gotta Flex on them by being out of 50 moles 50 Most Beautiful People. I mean look you can be on worse, right? I get a lot of journalists. They can say that Beyond worse. So I'm just curious when you were told you were going to be named.  This list. What did you think? You know what I don't honestly think much about that. I mean, I know people always talk about their looks and they try to downplay it. But for me, I just didn't think much of it. Now my friends dog. Oh, I was a I know you right rotate. Yeah, in fact the woman from people called a friend of mine and wanted to get some information on me, you know, his wife answered and it was a woman and so she said calling for this person.  And he said my wife jumped on me and said don't be having your girlfriend's call put the Eddie in this stuff it up. I mean, it was crazy. It was crazy. But I appreciate it and needless to say. Well I had to laugh a little bit because I didn't know it was just the description of it like it was just so cool. Just going somewhere else the Dapper 35 year old Detroit.  There was like he's the eyes come from his mother Jimmy a Lena Horne, look-alike his six to a hundred eighty pound frame from his late father Ed a long jump gold medalist it like they just they really want to give people a picture. So I'm not 3508 180 whatever anymore. You know, my eyes are still green. Oh, that's about all I got left and you don't have as they called it. They described it the Clark Gable mustache. No have that all my see more. Yes. I was like isn't this funny? But no. Thank you.  For joining me and we'll like pivot to a more serious conversation, even though I have some more fun stuff to ask you but speaking of conversations your book that you have out right now, which I'm very honored to be in I was one of a bunch of different people that you spoke to for this about critical conversations taking place in the black community. The name of the book is called conversations in black and you have some and again amazing people are here from Al Sharpton back.  Seen Waters Charlemagne Stacey Abrams DL Hughley again myself to run a bird. I mean just a really cross section wide range of people. So what inspired you to do this to do this, you know conversations for me has been the thing that I kind of made my career on everybody knew me for doing interviews and I had a show called conversations with that Gordon where I did a lot of the quote-unquote famous interviews, I've done over the years and so I wanted to and as you know, you know some of  Most interesting conversations you have is when the red light on the camera goes off for the microphones are turned off and then people kind of ease up and tell you what they really feel. And I said man, I really want to have those conversations and share them with people if I could and I said wouldn't it be great if I could get the people I have connection with in one room and one time and I knew that would be impossible with the caliber of folk we were going after so I said, we'll look I'll be the linchpin and I'll write it as if we were all in.  One room. I got the idea in 2012. Trayvon had just been killed Obama was going into second term. I had started to do some of the interviews for that book and and look how eight years makes a difference Bill Cosby was one of the people I interviewed Maya Angelou was still with us. I interviewed her for the book and I had begun and then I got a TV project had to lay this down and then I looked at the world and I said, let me let me pick that idea up again. I still love the idea.  So I went to 40 plus people that I thought would have something to say and that I thought were influencing the way Black America is shaping itself. And so each chapter is a different topic and I was and thank you. I was very blessed to have you know, again Harry Belafonte TI Killer Mike Michael Eric Dyson, April Rain who started Oscar so white, I mean the list goes on and on and on but you  You know, everybody was very candid and I appreciate it. So what as you were thinking about people that you wanted to include in the type of conversations that you wanted to have? You know, what were some of the things maybe you wound up learning from people or learning just through the process of writing this book that you will you know, that will be permanent takeaways for you know for me. It's just a thing of Black America has always been in this kind of, you know, we're making progress we're making progress, but we ain't quite there yet. We  And I'm tired of that conversation when we going to be there, right? I mean, I'm 59 now and I've heard that my entire life and we have made progress. There's no question about that. But I want us to start having conversations that move us to action below items and really start moving us to some of the things we talk about all the time. How long we going to talk about the wealth Gap how long we going to complain about Oscars being so white and knowing that it's a white institution of votes on them. So, I mean we can continue to get caught up in that and look if  I'm a black actor. I understand why I want an Oscar. I'll go ask for more money. But as a fan, I don't give a damn if you get the little statue or not. I was talking to Omari Hardwick one day and he was talking about you know ghosts and what that's meant to him and all of that and and I knew that he was I don't know that he would admit this. I hope I'm not telling Tales out of school, but I know he's been a little disappointed not to get an odd for an Emmy, right and Black America loves that character not told him. I said dude, don't let that bother you right the people that you  An out there to make this for love your character in the fact that the Emmys don't see that shouldn't really get you down. You should move on and know that you've made an impact with that character and we've got to start to understand that, you know, you don't have to be blessed by white folk to be good and we're still kind of hung up on that right? And so I wanted us to have those kinds of conversations. I wanted it to read. Where was it to political you didn't have to be wonky to get it. I wanted to talk about things like, you know,  Oh the images of Black America. I called that chapter the Madea dilemma. I wanted to talk about black girl magic and and to be honest about that. Not every black woman is Olivia Pope and some black women are still having issues and we need to make sure that we you know deal with that we talk about black men and the impact Nipsey Hussle had and I would have never guessed prior to his death the impact that Kobe Bryant had on black men is extraordinary. I mean just extraordinary, so these  Conversation we talked about black leadership and we're real about black leadership. We didn't just go. Oh everybody's doing a great job, you know because when when you're in the kitchen at the barbecue around the Thanksgiving dinner table, we don't think that every black leaders doing their thing. So I wanted this book to be that it's funny because I think from a media standpoint and even sometimes the way we talk about each other is that we keep saying we're not a monolith, but we talk about ourselves as if we are.  And so I think one of the my major takeaways from this book was the very nuanced conversations that were happening because a lot of times our conversations aren't appreciated for being that like, we're all very different and we have different perspectives opinions viewpoints that shaped how we think and feel about the world so that to me comes across real strongly in this book. It's a diversity of black opinion critical opinion. I talked about the idea that we say, we're not a monolith, but we have majority thought in our community.  Right, if you like pumpkin pie, you got hard way to go at a Thanksgiving table. I mean, let's be real you should be talked about it, you know, if you new friends, you know more than you knew black programming they living think you know living single is a great example because they were up against one another right? So if you went to work and you knew what Ross and I didn't watch it Ross and whatever.  The rest of them were you know, but you didn't know what Khadija was doing. Then that's a problem. Right? So we get into that and I think we've got to be honest. There's a chapter called am I black enough for you? Right? So this this whole Black Card thing, right who says what authentically black is and being light with light eyes. I've had to deal with that my entire life and anybody who knows me. I will put a dollar to a doughnut that you'll  Did hard to find a bigger n-word to me but most people would never never never believe that never believe that but I say if it's color. I also know that you're from Detroit. I am thinking all night. And as I sell people look at a from the way from the rap, you ain't from the rap Hood you from the fucking real here and you don't grow up in that City and not understand some people don't people who've never been Detroit hear about it, but you really write real but I say if it's color then are you telling me that?  That Clarence Thomas is black and Louis Farrakhan. I don't think so. So these are the conversations I wanted to get into. Well you get into them and I think it's in a way where it is an entry point for everybody that you don't that look there's as you point out there are some of us that are critical of certain black leaders you have in this book, but if you say are not on the same page with them, it's so many other people that are adding to this conversation. That's what I think makes it special you brought you brought him up a second ago, obviously right now we're taping this.  Cast in Los Angeles where this community is still very much reeling the whole world is but still very much reeling from the death of Kobe Bryant obviously now the conversation has shifted and everybody's looking at gil King all kind of sideways Gayle King recently had an interview with Lisa Leslie who had not spoken about her relationship with with Kobe in the wake of his passing. They were good friends somebody that she looked up to in terms of as a basketball player, but just  You know also just as a person like they had a really close relationship. So the gist of this of the interview was supposed to be about their relationship. And of course one of the questions Gayle King asked was how Lisa Leslie could reconcile the fact that somebody that she had a relationship with also have been accused of rape matter of fact, let's hear a little bit of that interview and then I'll ask you and for your reaction to this controversy after we hear it. It's been said that  His legacy is complicated because of sexual assault charge which was dismissed in 2003-2004. Is it complicated for you as a woman as a WNBA player? It's not complicated for me at all. Even if there's a few times that we've been at a club at the same time. Kobe's not the kind of guy never been like, you know least go get that girl or tell her or send her this I have other NBA friends that are like that Kobe's he he was never like that. I just never see  I have ever seen him being the kind of person that would be do something to violate a woman or be aggressive in that way. I that's just not the person that I know but Lisa you wouldn't see it though as his friend. You wouldn't see it. And that's possible. I just it's just I just don't I just don't believe that and I'm not saying things didn't happen. I just don't believe that things didn't happen with force. Is it even a fair question to talk about it? Considering he's no longer with us.  That it was resolved or is it really part of his history? I think that the media should be more respectful at this time. It's like if you had questions about it, you've had many years to ask him that I don't think it's something that we should keep hanging over his legacy. I mean it went to trial yet was a case is it was dismissed because the victim in the case refused to testify so it was dismissed and I think that  At that's how we should leave it. So what happened after this was that Snoop Dogg had a very strong response. He call Gayle King everything but a child of God and now everybody's trying to cancel Gayle King as you mention it. I remember I grew up watching you you have sat down with some of the biggest names some of the most controversial people because we don't talk about your interview with our Kelly as well. So you've been in jail Kings position. What did you think about her asking the question? And what did you think about the  So let me be transparent and say that I reached out to Gail the day it happened because I thought man you taking a lot of fire here. I mean a whole lot of fire. I would not have asked that question in that segment because I didn't think it was the appropriate segment to do. So, I think it's a fair question if you were doing an hour on Kobe Bryant's life, right because that's a chapter in his life whether you think him innocent or guilty. He still went to trial it was  Smith she didn't come excetera Etc. So you can't erase that portion of it if you're talking about his life. I just thought  Wrong segment to do it in if I'm just sitting across from you. It's not like Lisa was there that night it's not like she had any direct connection to Colorado and the things that went on there and I'll be honest. I think the wounds are still very raw. And so if you were going to do that, I think there's some questions you have to ask yourself and independent of that. I just as a producer would not have put that in that particular segment.  I think that's where she went wrong. I don't think she had any malice. I don't believe that I don't believe she was trying to you know, dog a black man. Now you can argue whether or not the media in general not gay but the media in general has been fair to black men and how they paint it Cosby and R.Kelly versus Matt Lauer and and anybody else that you know, Harvey Weinstein anybody else who comes to the table? I think it has not been even-handed right, but I think  That you can deal with Gail from a family perspective family and quotes. I don't think the way that a lot of people did it was the appropriate way and I tell you what, you know, we can't talk about black women being our queens and all this and then be okay with the language that was used whether you thought she was wrong or not. I mean, you know, I was like and I'm not approved. I'm you know, but that was rough. Yeah.  And that's you know, I don't I think you and I have very similar thoughts about that. I would it was funny because I was asked this question and I didn't have the not at all the relationship that Lisa had with Kobe he and I were friendly we had a rapport when I was at ESPN. I interviewed him several times. We did a one-on-one for BET Awards weekend, so I have gotten to know him, you know a little bit and so I was asked that question repeatedly.  And somebody brought this up and I think it's a fair question. Why are only black women being asked this question like generally speaking and this is where I think I would I agree with you is like the response to that and I love Snoop. He's one of my favorite people he has been on this podcast, but the way he responded to that and I get he's emotional and he's a big Laker fan and Kobe was a friend of his but he literally sic the dogs on their own Gayle King and it's like any study that you  Little shows that of all the ethnicities between both genders black women get it the worst when it comes to social media harassment threat, we get it the worst and so you basically even though you may have been using kind of Common Language by saying pull up. It's some people out there that take that shit literally. Yeah and like will roll up on getting that was the fear and that was it that was the fear and she was frightened and and justifiably so because you know, we use language so  So loosely and we assume that everybody who's listening has, you know, all of the chairs on the front porch, but that is not the case sometimes and so I think we've got to be careful and and then there is just this sense of you know again, and we talked about it quickly in the book this whole sense of respect for women in general black women specifically and though we like to talk about it up front as if everybody, you know respects and loves black women. That isn't always the case.  In our language and in the media certainly and so I think we've got to be very careful again. If you had issue that's not to say that you can't address that issue and certainly somebody like Snoop could get to Gayle King, you know, so there was a way to say Hey, you know, even a way publicly to say that's not the best way to go. I don't think that you know, CBS AR Gael may be handled it the best way they  could have but again, that's what I think personally but you know, I think that what we need to take away from this which a lot of people aren't talking enough about is the growth I saw in Kobe Bryant I of all the people I've interviewed. I've never interviewed Kobe only met him once which struck me as I thought about it and the time I met him we did not have a great conversation because it was around the time the Colorado trial was going on. So we were talking about  Possibly talking and I mentioned the people that I had talked with in these kinds of situation and he took offense to one of the people that I mentioned not talk to which was OJ Simpson. He's like, I know oh Jason I was like dude, I'm not comparing you. I'm just telling you like I who I do this, huh? Yeah, right. Yeah, and that's the only conversation that I have face-to-face with him. I'm a Pistons fan, so I didn't like him as a player in that sense, but  Here's what I loved about him. I saw a tremendous growth in a man. Not just a basketball player. I watched him go from kind of irascible cat that a lot of teammates didn't like to somebody who Not only was one of the greatest to ever play the game but became one who shared knowledge and, you know became a better teammate and then specifically for me because I'm so close to my daughter.  I watched him become a great father and and not hide it or not. Keep it private that he publicly said hey, you know, I am a father two daughters and I loved every minute of it. And so I let the Laker thing go, you know, I let our running go I let go and I appreciate it. And this was before the tragedy. I just appreciate it that you know, here's a man that I could say, you know, we all should aspire to grow.  Row, right and they people talk about his second act but I don't think about the business side of his second act. I think about the personal side of his second act. You know, I've talked to a number of Lakers who said to me he grew because they watched him kind of build a wall around himself in the beginning and people couldn't penetrate that wall and he later became this dude that as we see not only touched lives, but I mean moved people to a point. A nation grieved and so you got to appreciate that. Yeah. I was also somebody who what I appreciated about him is that he because he wanted to open up more he wanted to learn more to like he was he would be the type of person that would be in a room with you or with several people and he'd ask everybody how they do their job and everything about their job because it felt like he was a computer always downloading and I told the story before on the podcast and I wrote about it when I wrote a piece about him.  For the Atlantic is that it was amazing to me that our relationship started from disagreement because of those comments. He made about Trayvon Martin, which I thought were tone deaf. And so because of that, you know, usually no situations an athlete or a public figure they'll be mad at you as a journalist and never say anything ever. He was like he hit he slid in them DM's. I was like, I'm gonna need you to call me after the show he and I had never had a conversation ever. And so I called him we talked.  An hour underhooks to his perspective. He understood mine of which I did not change just because I was talking to him. I was like, hey, man, you missed it on that one. You know, these you talking about some parents whose son was killed. He was going to the store to get snacks George Zimmerman was looking for something else and there is no to me there is nothing that could have happened in that confrontation that ever would make that right and so to see him go from that and those comments that he made  Need to then going to Trayvon Martin's rallies, you know at the request of his parents and him and Vanessa hanging out with them and you know him becoming really more immersed. I think in Black issues. I think it's fair to say but that's what the book to do. What you just did there was a conversation that you had with him that opened his mind and so for me and said we should note that sybrina Fulton trayvon's mom is in this book and that's part and parcel of why I wanted the book to be a conversation.  Because I think sometimes people go here a speech or they just read something to see a sound bite on TV. They listen to it, but it doesn't resonate in the same way that if we have exchanged you were able to say to Kobe. Hey, man, you know kind of take a look at this broader aperture, you know, really look at what this is and I would suspect that it touched something in him and he was able to see that and so, you know, I think we need more of that, you know, you can't just be that this is the only way  Way and if it ain't that way, you ain't black. Well, okay, cool. Well, that's the thing. That's kind of disappointing to wear. This Gayle King conversation has gone is that now her and by extension Oprah got drugged up in Texas Summers up and like damn I wasn't doing shit at a sudden, you know, it's it's it's all this conversation about her suddenly. It becomes Oprah and Gayle hate black men and it's like man, we got to stop immediately when we disagree that we have to immediately stop.  Doing this black litmus test Michael Eric Dyson. I talked about it. I know he is in the book to it's like we talked about that like we can't be every time we disagree. Everybody can't be a sellout but but let's be real that's sense of who Oprah is to a fair number of black people. I won't say many or most but a fair number is real to Black Folk, you know for his beloved is she is by especially black women in so many corners. There are some people who still and have felt like this from the day she  she came on they say she touched that white woman. She don't touch no black woman when she doesn't get me stuff like that. I don't like really dude. That's what we're looking at here. I like they just forget about the millions. She gave them or house. I'm like, holy Christian. We don't look at those kinds of things enough and we don't explore them enough, right? So we have them again behind closed doors as opposed to saying. Okay, let's look at this this whole sense of canceled culture. That's stupid. You can't cancel somebody you can disagree with them. You should have some conversation. She can't cancel.  Little but you know we bought into this like it's real. Yeah, you know now we know to me if y'all can't even cancel Donald Trump. I don't hear about nobody a chance so that like whatever along those same lines though you I mean and I think we saw this with Gail is that but you as a journalist for years were able to balance and navigate this navigating as crazy as it may sound your Blackness with being a journalist, right? And again, you have sat down with some  Re you know controversial figures you sat down with a lot of great people, but I'm wondering for you how you were able to seemingly navigate that so well because they're like, we're still black at the end of the day even though we're journalists. So how are you able to do that? So successful couple of people have said that to me and I never really really thought about it. But as I've you know been doing the interviews with the book A couple of people have said to me. Hey, you know why we appreciated you so much is that you are authoritative like a news person who  You were black enough for us. You know, you never let that black thing going. So for me. I've always felt like well, I was black before I became a journalist, right? I was born black. I wasn't born a journalist. And again, you know, we laugh and tease about Detroit but there there's something about being born in Detroit. There's a pride in being black. You know Detroit was one of those cities that really was on the for of electing black Mayors and there was a sense of you know, what Motown was and there was a sense of empowerment of black people and so  for me, I can remember being at NBC and watching some of the black reporters who didn't want to do black stories because they didn't want to get pigeonholed and I thought you already that, you know, when they when they walk in they see that you are black. They don't think oh, no, there's a reporter they see you as a black reporter. And so I was the opposite. I always wanted to do black stories and I wanted to do black stories because I knew I could do them correctly, right? Because when I would watch them do them, I think that ain't us that's not what we do. I  In Chicago and they asked Ann Curry and I to do some quote unquote minority stories, right and they said we want you to do a story about the black vote in Chicago. And so I said, okay cool. I'll do that and the woman young white girl said and so go to Cabrini-Green. So for people who don't know Cabrini-Green was one of the big projects and Chicago and I said, what do you want to know what Cabrini-Green voters are she goes? No, just black people. Well right there. I'm like  No, I'm going to Cabrini-Green. I'll get you some black people in Chicago because you do know we all don't live in country, right they not know we don't know if in The Prado I don't know good times they did but that's the point. They don't really know right they see us in one light. The only light they know I'm sure that they had been doing stories and they always told them go to Cabrini-Green because it's a bunch of black people there. They had no idea that the city is full of black people Rich poor, you know big little I mean they're there and  It was important for me. So for me, you know, I wanted to keep my little Detroit swag. I wanted I didn't want the blue blazer and a red tie and a white shirt, you know, so my clothes and just the way I carry myself it stay black enough, right? I wasn't my true self because none of us are what we can try usually be that on that third step ahead. I was black enough and that was important to me that was important to me. So some of the names you interview Nelson Mandela  Katya OJ Simpson as you brought up and what people may be forget is that you were one of the first journalists. I don't know who might have been before you but I'll just say you were among the first journalist to have a sit-down with our Kelly and this is when he initially there were charged it was it was after the tape, correct? It was his first television interview after the tape has surfaced right know people had heard about it hadn't seen it. Then people saw it and  Got him to sit down and there is another one of those things where you've got a beloved black figure who you know, if you ask certain questions may not come out in the best light and I always say, you know, and then you've got their handlers who want to tell you what you can and cannot ask and my whole career has been shaped around as most good journalists will do. No. I'm not going to agree not to  Ask your client cannot answer the question, but I'm going to ask it but yeah, that was one of those that you know gained us a lot of attention and it was maybe that first real crack and you know, the R Kelly model what was funny to me was when that came out in people's like we going to boycott and he ain't right and then Chocolate Factory dropped well.  About not you know not being afraid to ask these tough questions, especially on a sensitive subject matter as this one. Here's a clip from you asking our Kelly about illya in particular. Illya  that was an issue that a lot of people came to both of you at the time 94 and wonder the rumor was that you had married her.  We know she's gone. Now. We know that she can't defend herself but records have been brought up a marriage license and an annulment paper. No disrespect here Gordon, but  Ali has gone and I have a lot of respect for Leah and I and our parents I would definitely not be even discussing and Leah, I will not do it because I would not ask has nothing to do with this and I just but Robert out of respect for her mom and her father understanding and again if you choose not to I understand.  I don't want you to talk about Alia as much as I want to clear up the situation well, but by her not having anything to do with the situation, I would hope that people and my fans and everybody will understand why it is I definitely so is it fair to say though that the legal documents that have been shown are real. I really don't think it's fair to say anything dealing with aleeya because I just don't think that Alia, you know deserves that I don't I wouldn't want to bring up right now.  Now it is you were doing that interview. Well one, how did you get it? Like what what made our Kelly because I will say this I getting back real quickly to weird timeout Gayle King and people are bringing up when she went after our Kelly, but she didn't go after Harvey Weinstein. I'm like first of all nobody told our Kelly's dumbass to do that interview. Nobody did alright you have to agree to do it. She has interviewed Harvey Weinstein's lawyer and one of his accusers that was already done, but our Kelly has made himself available. So it is you better believe if  She could have sat down with Harvey Weinstein. She would have everybody they mama trying to get that interview. Like that is his lawyers just smart enough that he's not sitting down with anybody. So anyway, I again as I ask you how did you wind up getting this? So, you know, it was a time where everybody was going after our Kelly and I think that there are a couple of people in the industry that kind of make a name for themselves that if you want to talk to somebody here the 10 people you want to go to and at that time being  He had a greater position than they have now because white folks didn't care about black people in the news back then see now. You know TMZ would have it or extra would have it or he'd go on, you know a white show back then they didn't care about our Kelly so it wasn't important. And so when the tape broke his people realize we got to talk to somebody and I'm sure he probably had talked to some disc jockeys and some other  Things but I think they wanted somebody who they felt would give some credibility to the interview and some weight to it and to her credit my who still with me today my Booker Carol Johnson green never gave up on trying to get our Kelly I kept saying he ain't talking he forget him. He ain't talking and she just kept going and kept going and kept going and one day. She literally burst into my office. I thought somebody had died. Literally I was like, she was screaming and yelling. We got it. We got it. We got it and we got it.  And so we flew out and set out with him and it was amazing to me because you know, the denial was there. He kept telling me he never he didn't look at the tape and I said well, why wouldn't you look at the tape and he said well if I know I didn't do it. Why would I look at the tape? I said dude, there's somebody look that much like me.  I would absolutely want to see what they look like. And you know, when we were done again when that red light goes off. He kept saying to me you believe me and don't you believe me. Believe me, and I said dude, it's not for me to believe you or not believe you I said I will tell you this I might have said this on the air I said if that were my daughter I'd be looking for you. That's how much it looks like you because it is original original claim was that was his brother. He tried to get his brother to take the rap for him and you know, but we are culpable in.  To all right now because black people had heard the whispers about our Kelly. The Alia thing was like we acted like that and so has just assume let's just assume that he really loved Dahlia, you know back in the day people were marrying 16 year olds, and I don't mean that day but back in the day right further back than that, but I will say this let's let's give him that anomaly. Let's just say that was the one and whatever special connection they had is weird as it might seem let's give him  That one it's the rest of them that caused real problems that we knew. Okay. We can't just give him a Leah if we're hearing about this one this one this one in this one and so at some level though because of his genius. We were able to look away. It's the same thing. God Rest his soul with Michael Jackson, right another person that I did a story on we were never able to sit down with him per se but Johnny,  Karin was a mentor of mine and he wanted me to do a story when he was representing Michael from their perspective of what a day at Neverland was right. So I flew out to the ranch and walked around with Michael and the kids and but again let that Michael Jackson be the postman Michael Jackson. Not the Superstar we to run that dude out on a rail you having sleepovers with  Seven and twelve and thirteen-year-olds now that ain't happening in my neighborhood. But Michael Jackson, it's a whole nother thing. So Society has some culpability in all of this too. Well, I mean considering like as much as people have tried to make our Kelly into the victim to your point. Do you realize that day in a black man out there that could be victimizing women for 30 years 30 years and nobody say a word and get away with it or everybody's  Just something to happen like that. He got away with that long time. Same thing with Bill Cosby. This is a long time. So that's what happened when you not just not just have talent but you have the money to defend what you do and you provide something. It's a lot of people out there still they not giving up Step In The Name of Love. It just happened. That's all you you know, and I still listen I will play his music in my house. I won't buy it anymore, right? I will not go.  Go to another concert, right but I'm not if you said to me because I had this argument friend of mine. You can't listen to our Kelly Nomo. So I said, okay. Well, let's go turn off every freak out there that you can tell you my record. Watch a TV show watch a movie. See how many people you come up. Well, we wouldn't be watching or listening a lot because now it's like so ingrained that he is a monster like I can't even do it bad and especially his earlier stuff which feel like a blueprint  Him wrapping up with him singing rather smell here sometimes like oh there's some truth to you know, I really can't so it's all right. I know it in the crib take you give him no money no more no more, right? That's the more important part. Look at I got a lot more. I want to discuss with you particularly. Again this you the your career Ledger of the people that you've interviewed is really spectacular. So I definitely wanted to get into you.  Talking about your interview with Tupac which also became something that was very held your thoughts also on this upcoming election because I know you have some thoughts on that and I have some fun questions for you. We gonna test your Detroit - so more with air Gordon when we return   It when you look over the scope of your career, why do you think so many of so many important newsmakers celebrities? Why do you think they trusted you? I think trust is the key word there, right? I tried to be fair and I continue to try to do that. Even if I don't like you don't like your stance, so I try to present it in a way that you  It to me if it's a taped interview, you know, I don't try to slant it once you get back to editing and I try to be fair but the journalism I grew up with and was taught is different than the journalism of today. Somebody asked me today at another interview, you know, do you ever think we'll get back to trustee journalism? I don't know. It's it's different if you were a host of a show or your talking head and a lot of host now are Talking Heads. They're not necessarily.  They haven't been trained that way this whole sense of showing both sides and double sourcing and all the things that we grew up with. It really has gone by the wayside. So I don't know but I would like to believe that people trusted that I was going to be fair. Even if I disagree with them and it has not been until the Trump Administration that I ever came out. Even when I did not like a president in office and publicly said anything, you know again that old-school.  Me I deliver the story I but I never say you know, this is horrible. And this I have absolutely said that now we have an inept incompetent man in the White House and again America has culpability in that. I don't blame him for being there. That's our fault, but  The kind of lockstep March that I've seen some people fall into his frightening and you really start to think about you know, this is how things like slavery and the Holocaust can happen, you know, people say that could never happen again. Oh, yeah, look at the lockstep that Republicans the great majority of them have gotten into and the fact that because Mitt Romney said the other week,  I've got to follow my faith and my God, and that's great, but it shouldn't have been the shock that it became because the rest of these fools have simply said, oh my God, I'm too afraid to go against Trump. Are they afraid or is it because his he keeps them in power? You know, I think they've just made the train both because both sphere right in the sense of even if it's just keeping them in power and listen, it's not  Political power this is and we again conversations we've had behind closed doors Black Folk understood that eventually there will come a time where white people would become very threatened by means of the way. They've lived their entire lives the opportunities. They've been given and this is you know, I try to tell white folks when we have these conversations. This isn't beat me all up. It's just the truth, right? And so when you see your way of life being threatened and it's starting to slip  Go away, you know you get your back up and you start in that Foxhole with the people that look like you and you start fighting to keep that Foxhole safe. One of the things that I think about is, you know, the wealth Gap we talked about this in the book take a look at how many people found Robert Smith when he wiped away the debt last year for more house.  five billion dollars  richest black man in America  But Jeff Bezos is worth a hundred and twenty three billion after a divorce. So you compare 5 billion to a hundred twenty-three billion and now you start to understand even at that level the wealth Gap is so wide it is almost impossible to catch up which is why we always have this sense of you know, how white people say Let It Go slavery was not now dude. I ain't Lettin it go cause y'all haven't let it go. It ain't Fair yet.  Yeah, I mean and they keep benefiting from it. So to your point. So the Federal Reserve survey of Consumer Finance says that a typical black family has only 10 cents for every dollar held by a typical white family, which is when you think about how insane that stat is the wealth Gap now looks worse today than it did, you know when our parents and Grandparents were alive and it's like how is that possible when we've had basic progress, you know civil rights like we've had  Basic progress that's been established and yet this wealth Gap. So that's when we have to start to be critical of politicians. I watched the other night when they were on stage the Democratic nominees talking about what has to happen for black people. When's it gonna happen? Y'all been saying the same stuff for the for as long as I can remember right and black leadership?  What are we doing the closes wealth Gap? What are we doing to close the education Gap? What are we doing to have a better floor for Black Folk to stand on economically sure. There's some people who have made great strides and have great positions and great. But the lot of us still struggle are still in poverty. There's still a position of being unable to really get sure footing and take advantage of opportunities. And so I just think  At some point we need new narratives and that's Again part of why I wanted to do the book. I think that the narratives that took us to this point. We're great and there was an entire generation that were you know, I mean the greatest of the great that 60s generation Freedom Fighters and all those folk those were fantastic people who literally put their lives on the line, but where do we go from here? And that's the big question that I keep saying to  To all of us. Do you know because you got a couple of Sony's and Alexis in the driveway does not mean you made it. No, but I do think one thing maybe we need to get over and what had me thinking about. This is not only the conversation you and I had when you were doing the research and writing for this book, but also I was reading Coretta Scott King James biography, which is Amazing by the way, and I felt ashamed I did not know she even wrote one she wrote doing with and with another person.  And when she would talk about some of the infighting that was going on. It was actually a relief because I think we had because we do think so highly of that generation with her and dr. Martin Luther King Malcolm X even before then we think so highly of him that we have thought that they never had any problems with each other that there was never any infighting that there was never which is the perennial sort of black tension of what should we do this outside looking in or should we do this from the  the inside out like we're constantly arguing about this, right and it was actually a relief to figure out that you know, what even then even though they all agreed what needed to be achieved. They weren't all on the same page and that was okay not at all and it was human nature. I mean that that will always happen but what they did and there was generational in fighting there was just ego in fighting there. But what that generation did not allow is for any of that to become bigger than the prize, correct? And so they found ways  Around it, you know, they're historians will continue to argue whether a Phillip Randolph was really the true father of the civil rights movement and a greater force than King, you know some historians believe King was just a better media magnate and that he presented himself better and was a better order and then you can have those arguments but over and above that.  The divisions between Roy Wilkins thought Stokely Carmichael's thought Martin Luther King. Junior's thought were wide, but they all had a sense that we cannot allow this to get us so far off track that we lose sight of it and I think today because there is no One Singular segregation other than I would I would argue the issue with policing a black people now, that's kind of the One Singular issue that touches  Is all of us back then segregation touched everybody. I don't care if you were rich or poor as a black person it touched everybody and as we began to break those barriers there were divisions that didn't touch everybody but policing touches everyone and so I am still hoping that black leadership and black folk will find a singular issue. Let's make it that and say Here's the one thing that we're all going to jump on board on and find ways to make real change and that's where I think leadership has.  Fallen, you know we keep doing these same town hall meetings. How many Galas are we going to have? How many Town Halls are we going to have how many times are we going to salute this corporate person of that course, that's all great. It gets you a chance middle-class Black Folk to wear your Tuxedos and all of that but we ain't changing nothing. And so I think we gotta be about moving forward and a better way. What do you what are your thoughts on? I feel like I hear this more frequently and it's kind of disappointing because of what's at stake.  Why are so many of us still not engaged in the political process? Because I think we believe and and you can make this argument that it hasn't done Us justice enough, but I remind people it was legislatively that made the real difference at the end of the day. It wasn't the marching by itself. And so if you believe IE Stacey Abrams that there's voter suppression and  That there are Shenanigans going on to keep you out of office. Some people will walk away and say well what good is it to do what they tell me to do because they change the rules in the middle of the game that's always been the case here. And so the only way you can win a game is to play it. I don't know of any team or athlete that want a game sitting on the sidelines. And so whether the rules are fair,  Not that's one issue. But what I do know is you got to be on the field to win and so we have to continue 2020 is going to show our metal, you know, black people talking about all this stuff is lot of yapping around we about to see what we're made of because someone came to me the other day. So what are we gonna do is if Trump gets back in how we going to get up there? And I said well then dude, it's too late. You got your chance right now.  There's nothing to say he has to get back in now have Democrats giving given you enough to give your vote? No, they have not. Is it giving your vote away to some degree? But what we do is we think election day is the end of the race. It's not that's the beginning of the race and so once you put somebody in office, that's when your demand start and black folk have never really demanded ink  Shooting of President Obama elected officials pay us back for what we've given to them and that's what we have to start doing. The kind of power Democrats have already conceded can't win it without the black vote. Okay now is the time how do you leverage that? Yep, how do you leverage that? And that's why sometimes I go to Black leadership and say it's not enough for you just to have meetings at the White House. Will you doing what else are you doing State dinner? That's cool for you, but come on man my fear though.  Is that because there is a sense of you know, almost depression and I think there's a there was a different level of trust that was broken with Donald Trump being in office and looking at how the polls are turning now. It just it seems to me that there's a lot of black people who feel those who are engaged who feel like we can't take any chances. We have to vote for somebody that white people are going to vote for because when we all went into the poles and 16  We didn't know these white people are gonna vote for Donald Trump and they let us down right and so I get that hysteria, but that's also how you know as the old adage goes keep doing what you're doing on keep getting what you getting right? And so they're looking at how this thing is shaping up. I'm just like man now is the time to make a bold decision not to do the opposite because that's right. That's the only way you can break this up. There's no question about it. And and the fact that Hillary Clinton ran a piss poor campaign in 2016.  It is not enough to just say well she ran a poor campaign and look what we got. Yeah, you know she ran a poor campaign took Black Folk for granted thought, you know appearing with LeBron and a couple of selfies would Beyoncé and Jay was enough that wasn't enough and you didn't turn folk out but what I also tell people is when you decided not to go it wasn't just getting Trump for years. It was getting close now to 200 federal judge appointments that will affect not only you how was the long not just your children?  But potentially your grandchildren now and Trump said the other day and we got a lot of them in the pipeline so that in and of itself should be enough to get your ass up get registered and then go vote that day. I'm amazed at the people who register but then on Election Day it over they get tired. They show his own they gotta get their hair did all them things. Come on, man. Well, I'm amazed that we still in despite all this wonderful technology.  You have not figured out a way to make voting more excited don't want to do that. Oh, I know because they don't want all of us voting they don't and as I've said to many young people if your vote wasn't worth anything. Why are they keep trying to take it from this? Right? So looking at you know, your the your long career and everything you've done? Why did you decide to become a journalist? Like why and when I should say, you know, I used to when I grew up I thought oh I wanted to be a lawyer right because you know you watch Parenthood.  Cousin tied above. Yeah, you watch Perry Mason and you know, you see the dramatic thing in the courtroom and I always thought that was cool. Right and and I love clothes he wore a suit and all of that but I also in junior high school used to pretend like I was doing the news right just to Anchor and so one of my professors in college said, I think you'd be good at this. You should give it a try and really thought about it and I graduated and my  Buddy and who later became police chief at Highland Park he and I used to our job was because when I graduated I didn't have a job was to go out in front of his mama's house and throw the softball for about six hours. It's so one day I said dude, if we don't stop this is going to be it for us and so my brother's old girlfriend worked at the PBS affiliate in Detroit, and she wasn't talking to him any longer, but we were still cool and she got me in as an intern.  And I worked as an unpaid intern there for close to a year and I was serious about it and I got higher and you know, that was the start of it and I just it was just something that people said they thought I would be good at it wasn't a burning desire from the time. I was little and even when I was pretending I never thought that was going to be my career, you know, I went from being Bruce Lee to Julius Erving to you know, I mean I traditional kind of male thoughts.  Who I was going to be right but yeah, the dope is good karate expert in the world or you know, but it all fell into place and I started as an intern I started hosting a show when the host didn't show up one night and I had to do it and then a friend of mine because I would have never done this a friend of mine who was a hustler in Detroit and by that. I mean she was  Is a hustler in that she was a female camera person out in the field which never happened back then and she contacted bet and said hey we want to do your stories for bet news. So we became the freelance Bureau for BT news and I was a reporter and I'm telling you it all just kind of rolled together and a lot of it had very very little to do with me. I was just in the middle of the street getting hit boom boom boom, and I just kept getting up so  So will you represent at least for a lot of us that I didn't watch BT from the beginning beginning but close to the beginning and you represent a part of that kind of old school BT Legacy, you know what those videos soul and Caribbean rhythms and Summit Teen Summit and of course then BT news and there has been I've heard BT get criticized a lot because they eliminate their news Department. I know it's obviously under different ownership now with Viacom  But when you when you see in present-day how they've sort of decided to make their approach to news and serious issues. What are your thoughts about how different things? Yeah. I think that Beatty had a rough go and I'm not a BT apologist by any means, I think it had a rough go in the early days because it had to be everything to everybody. Right and Bob Johnson used to tell people look you want more news watch it more right and and Bob was strictly now.  Amber's right. We show rump shaking videos because y'all watch him we show this and to a great degree. He kept the news Department afloat for many years and then we started to make money. And so today I think it is part and parcel whether it's bttv one or any of the the new kind of Slants to Black programming a lot of it is what what we  Each in sheer numbers, but I also tell people why folk don't watch news in huge numbers. They know the importance of it networks know the importance of it and there's a reason that those news division. Yeah, they make money, but they could make more money with an entertainment entertainment program in that our slot but there's a reason because there's gravity to news there is power to news and that's why they keep them. And so whether it's black newspapers,  Black radio black TV shows, you know you talk about in the book The the one in need to make sure that we keep these things afloat what you're doing independently what Roland Martin is trying to do independently, all of these things are important. I've got some things that we are hoping to announce very soon, but it's a struggle. I mean, let's be real about it. It's a struggle black people will tell you. Yeah. Yeah. We miss you. We want to okay, dude, but they did you watch did you watch it? All right, right.  And you know, but I also know there were times where I did shows and people gave me a number which I thought was unrealistic ratings wise. We surpassed that number they still cancel the show. So at some level those networks didn't want it and was it just be T. So, I mean, we've got to we've got to get to what we say we want and what we really want and be about understanding though that the dissemination of information.  It's still important very much. So a lot of people I always tend to think that BT gets a truly unfair amount of criticism. I think people are still in the mode of saying that they got to be all this to everybody even though there's Now options you have Revolt you have TV one you have other other places that people can go because I was having a conversation with somebody who work there and they were telling me that BT passed up on on Love and Hip Hop, right which is  Huge franchise and like it or not not gonna lie. I watch it. There it is. I love the I love the Atlanta New York with those are my favorite I watch it. But I do also watch the news and you gotta balance it out, right? So that was how my ratchet with my reading. I will read it Gore's book and also watch loving us fair, but there but there are a whole generation of people that don't believe that do not do that believe this stuff to be real and and emulated. Yeah, right. And so if I'm getting paid to put  pull somebody's we've that's one thing if I'm out at Chipotle because you said something wrong to me and I'm pulling your weed. That's a whole nother thing. And so I don't I don't legislate anybody's entertainment right? Because I watch I watch reality show but I've watched crazy stuff over the years, but I also understand that what you were talking about that balance is important and if we don't start to kind of show people that the need of a balances there, we're kind of out of  Q which is what we continue to be because people are too afraid to say sometimes that's a little too much or you know, we want to cancel culture but we don't want to regulate it. Like we used to back in the day, right and especially this year with having accurate correct information in context in a election year is really important. And so I'm wondering, you know, there's a there's a dearth of black journalists out there. You know. I looked at some statistics.  Six recently about the number of us that have left the field altogether and it's a staggering number and I'm not sure people in our own Community. I realize it's fashionable to hate the media I get it right but at the same time, it feels like a lot of us do not understand how that has drastically changed how we recovered how the issues that are important in our community and people think everything's all right, because I see Don Lemon every night. Well, they see Joy read on the weekend or the and and that's great that those faces are there, but the real power  Is not in those seats and that's only an hour a night or an hour on a weekend or two hours enjoys case Saturday and Sunday. And so we have to understand that. The reason that black newspaper died is because we didn't support them. The reason that black radio coughed its way into non-existence for the most part. It's because we allow those stations to be bought up by white conglomerates, and we just  Continue to listen not worrying about it because we heard enough of our music and then the music became formulaic. You can only hear five songs and artists like Prince had had he been conceived today would have never become prints because they wouldn't play it that music would have not not gotten play in Detroit. There was an independent DJ who really launched princes career the electrifying Mojo. I remember him and and he's the reason Prince became so big because  But he wanted they were like, who is this dude? You know this freak is what they were looking at principles crazy to most people back then the music. What was it Rock was it on be was it but you had an independent DJ who could do that and we would have lost a genius had it been today's format where you only get to play 10 songs before I get to this fun little game I have for you. I want to ask you, you know, did you ever feel as if you were getting the  the credit that you deserve because as I said when people if you go down your career resume, everybody would take that right now number one, but yet whenever there were conversations about who the best journalists your name will come up here and there but you know, of course before all the shit went down with him, but they say Matt Lauer or this person or that person and to me your name did not come up enough. So did you feel as if to some degree you were not giving your flowers? Yeah, but you know what I also  It's the time you come up. So if you say to me have I ever had a thought of watching somebody on the network and going I'm better than that person. Hell, yeah, right but like I didn't control that and if I had gotten lost it it's like an athlete who gets lost in that sense of why and I'm making the All-Star Game better than some well maybe but the fans like this person better or you know, the ownership likes that person better and at that point when I was in the game and  That way I don't think that networks were ready to really Place Black Folk in the way, you know, they had one so Gumbel was at NBC what we don't need another listen. I got wind of a closed-door meeting that NBC had once and they were looking at the new talent and they brought my name up and they said he's good, but I think he'll be another Gumbel and by that they meant that Bryant even though some people use think Bryant was a sellout and he's Uncle Tom Bryant was very  Listen, I've got to say that they don't was nothing he was he is heavier that it was on point. He just never you know Ward on his sleeve and by that they meant we'd have another black dude who was going to say what he believed because nothing about you to is a like anybody that watches both of you. There's nothing about YouTube that are alike but they knew that he's going to be one who's going to tell us no, I'm not doing that or no we need to do that. And so I think that was a time I came up so I've had those thoughts in  In my lifetime. I've also had a great career, right? So in one sense could have been bigger by Network standards and all. Yeah, should it have been maybe but if I look at my career and the people I've talked to in the places. I've gone I can't have any real regrets. Yeah. I mean look you your fave out. There ain't they don't have Mandela to Paco J&R Kelly or any other thing is I'm very thankful that I'm 30 years in and I'm  Still doing stuff. I mean they're very few people who started when I started who are still in this game or still somewhat relevant or still so I'm good. Alright, and now it's time to play a game. It's called this of that. All right, get two choices not for you. Just get to pick one or the other and not this and that know this or that or very important. Okay Thriller Off the Wall.   Thriller that was a reluctant it was it since they're both great. They're both great. The real answer is off the wall, but that's okay greens are mac and cheese greens. I just don't like cheese like I used to Greens. Is that a lactose type of the no no. No, that's not the issue. Okay. I mean on any given day by day nor the field.  The field have you ever I still don't totally believe it even though I've seen these poles but it cuz it looks like his the his campaign has completely imploded Josephus. Is that Uncle that means well, but just can't do it no more. You know how you have that fun uncle and then he got too old to be really fun, but he still wanted to that's Joe Biden. All right. I still there's a part of me that wonders are we is this going to really turn out the way that we think in terms of like, you know, he  As such the leader for a long time that it's just kind of hard for me to believe that the total bottom dropped out. But there we are. Call me younger Dennis Archer call me. Yeah, those are the both of the mayor's from Detroit for those who don't know. I figured you say call me. I almost wonder if that's a generational thing to some degree not if you look at it realistically now that was he was that love Dennis Archer. No one well and but Coleman Young was the man he brought us into a different day. That's for sure Four. Tops are The Temptations.  Wow, I would I would probably have to say the Temptations only because the Four Tops by time. I was old enough to really appreciate music. They were on the latter parts of their hits, but I'll go with the temps and finally and I think this might be the toughest. I did Marvin Gaye Stevie Wonder. Wow.  Always Save The Best For Last yeah. Yeah, I would probably go with Stevie gay. Yeah. Yeah, that is number. I got some hits don't eat that is not an answer. If you ask people tough questions under then Batman wonder and answer I'm going on acceptable Stevie Wonder Maybe today. Well you could  Always say longevity body of work and forcing Marvin Gaye's like cut short, right, but then my favorite album of all time is what's going on. So, you know, you like that better the songs in the key of Life. Uh, I do only only because I think that just the dynamic of what Marvin was talking about was just so song Zakia like interventions is just as cold as that's why I said Marvin Gaye Stevie Wonder and mixed to and yeah you came up.  But today I'm I know Stevie J Stevie Stevie Stevie Wonder one day. I'm not letting you get away with that and thank you so much for joining me. I appreciate it. Thank you for being a part of the book. I was going to say I really appreciate the fact that you included me. I cannot encourage people enough to please pick up conversations. And yeah, just just pick it up on shows. I'm not on. Yeah, baby. I'll encourage it every every time I'm out. I'll be unofficial mouthpiece for you because  Not only do you get the diversity of opinion of the people in there, but I think it's it's just a very easy good digestible read. So certainly if you're concerned about these issues as we are perfect book to pick up and make a friend pick one up too. So we had told y'all I ain't out here supporting the news like y'all need to and I agree. So pick up his book. Anyway, it's getting out of here our final segments coming up. I say I heard man one day. I'm gonna stop talking about myself like I'm two people  The final segment is coming up. Fuck it. I'm bothered.   So as of the taping of this podcast its primary season, which is why now more than ever. I think we need to get a few things straight now the winners and losers don't really matter to me. That's a separate discussion. What's bothering me right now is that the Democrats just can't get out of their own way, and I'm not talking about the candidates because  And those decisions will be made but the Democratic supporters who are spending so much time focused on the wrong shit. I have seen so many people tweeting about how they don't feel inspired or how if their particular candidate doesn't win. They're just gonna say fuck it and not vote or this silly ass hand-wringing about decorum and blah blah blah blah blah. Do you need a candidate to inspire you? What are you five inspiration is certainly ideal.  Deal but inspiration isn't a necessary quality for a candidate. Are they competent? Can they get shit done? Do they know that the Kansas City Chiefs playing Missouri and not in Kansas. Well, your political candidate isn't your eHarmony or Christian Mingle match? Can they do the job or not? Also, all of you people who are threatening not to vote if your candidate isn't picked y'all don't even deserve to vote with an opinion like that. Stay home and you'll get exactly what you deserve and trust me you won't like it because you don't like it now.  And finally, I don't care about Nancy Pelosi's paper tearing. I don't care that Elizabeth Warren probably has a Bernie Sanders voodoo doll at home that she sticks needles in at night. I don't care about who gets along and who doesn't if winning the election is the utmost importance all of this in the grand scheme doesn't even fucking matter. What matters is are you going to the polls in November or not? Stay unbothered?   Jamel Hill isn't bothered.

spotify:episode:4MmTj8OGgFuNQxGP6DR9FC	Hello, welcome to the fabulous BCR 101.9 FM with me. Guess who this is.  Take a minute to recognize it. This is Tara after the navigation coach and welcome to living in Stereo y'all they gave me a radio show ha ha. This is possibly the best day of my life. I'm sitting here. There's so many buttons in front of me. I might have just a breakdown, but we're just going to go with the flow for a minute. It is Sunday the 10th of August and it is 4 p.m. This is a pre-recorded. So let's hope that may of done what they needed to do.  I hope life is good out there and that everyone is smiling and happy and healthy and all them kind of things. And so what are we going to be doing on this show? We're going to just have the crack. So I'll have the chat and we'll play some tunes. And for anyone who doesn't know what I do. I am a life coach. So we'll drop a bit of that good stuff in there. So I'll kind of give you a bit of insight into what's happening in my life how I got to where I am and all your books that I'm listening to or train and that I'm going through or  or basically what's happening in the world Cochin and it's an exciting platform to be on at the moment. It seems to have just exploded in Ireland probably in the last one year. I would say huge in America huge in Europe, but it definitely has hit Irish Waters in a big way in probably the last year and some of the people listening because this is like ballon a local radio and we're all about hashtag vocal about local would know me from Supervalu. So in my  Obvious life that was where I used to work had a ball of their would an absolutely amazing bunch of people so big shout out to Maloney Supervalu and bond re top spot for sharpening Balon Heir and that's where I was for about 10 years and I was working on an amazing amazing bunch of people and learned a hell of a lot. I was kind of where I started on my journey and I wasn't done before that. She had gray crack there too. And so after kind of the retail life and all that fun, I  went on and trained with the Irish life coach Institute in Dublin and qualified as a life coach and the rest as they say is history, but I'm looking forward to having the crack and the chats and telling you all my news and playing some tunes and just living life and a little bit of stereo for an hour every Sunday. Sure. Where would you be gone? We're going to kick it off with a little bit of key Alice settle and a winner tune from an amazing movie that was out this  I'm called the greatest showman. So this is a little bit of this is me.  I am not a stranger to the dark hide away. They say because we don't want your broken parts. I've learned to be ashamed of.  Run away you say no one. I love you as you are, but I won't let them break down.          Just want to cut me down. I'm gonna send it back gonna drown my they say spray. This is bruised. This is who I meant to be. This is me.    What a tune what at Yoon off. You haven't seen that movie. Make sure that you make like make time to see it. It's just such a feel-good movie small people in here again to talk as well good times. And yeah, this is so mad. I know I'm only a few buttons to press but you my heart is in my mouth, but it's all good. Push yourself outside of your comfort zone. I'm so again, you are listening to BBC or 101.9 FM and you can listen online at www.ppsd.com  FM dad IE if you want to give me a shout and say hello, make sure you do you can drop us a text or a water after all it's seven seven one seven five one seven five you are listening to live in and stereo with Tara rafter the navigation coach. They gave me a radio show y'all gave me is she oh, this is like dream come true stuff. I had this on my vision board. You haven't got a vision board the Lord save us money out. Your life vision boards are amazing. Anyone has read kind of like the sea crush or isn't it?  Like that whole Law of Attraction and manifestation stuff and vision boards are game changers. So there's actually an app course is an act as an app for everything what it's called Hey house and you can download it on your phone and you can create your own vision board saw a vision board should be visual representations of what you would like your future to look like and it's gas. So I remember last year when I made the one for 2018  I can put stuff on it that seems like you know reach for the moon and if you have hit the Stars happy days, so make sure that you'd go big or go home. And so I started my business in October of 2017. So I was a new coach and you're playing in the big leagues. So there's about a hundred and seventy registered life coaches in Ireland and one of the pictures I put on my vision board was an award from ICF, which is the international coach Federation.  And it was mad I put a picture of the award not knowing how in the name of God or whatever even potentially happen because I was so new to the world of coaching and all that stuff and I worked really hard for the first year in business and you know created a reputable body of work. I suppose you would say and yeah when forward for the the court in Awards with the ICF in November of 2018 and it goes  External panel of judges and they kind of they would look at your body work and what you've done in the past year and the impact that you've made to coaching as an industry and your way and your Spin and your authenticity as a coach and external panel of Judges. Look at all of those things and I warned Irish life coach of the year yet in couldn't believe it like that is just  So exciting I couldn't believe it. I was totally Blown Away to be honest, which I nearly didn't go on the night and in the guide open. Hello - boss and amazing. And that was one of the things that was on my vision board. So if you're going to make one you can do it like buy a cheap cork board and or a whiteboard or whatever and put it somewhere that you can see it in the morning and the evening a great idea with the one on your phone is you can let your app be your screensaver like the  Behind all your apps on your phone. So your subconscious mind is looking at it all the time and it can be visual pictures of things that you want to achieve in your life. It can be words. So it could be happy healthy lot of stuff like that. It could be feelings and content peaceful, you know motivated like all of those you can put in words pictures listen you can do for you and you can draw I've seen some of the most incredible ones down through the years what it's amazing to give your mind something to aim at  and it's brilliant for the subconscious mind because that's what's running the shore in the background. So remember 95% of what's happening in the world is the subconscious mind and 5% of what shows up as your conscious mind. So if you come start a program and work on your subconscious mind amazing things have been y'all. Okay, let's take another tune because I'm rambling. I love this one by Ron One Republic and this is a song called I  So sit back and enjoy turn it off because this one is deadly.  Over you take that jump. Don't feel the fall.  screaming your  Hopefully if everybody runs you to stay hope that you fall in love and it hurts so bad.  comes you say  I hope that you spend your days, but they all add up.  I'll say.   I swear.   Isn't that one deadly anytime? I put that I'll I seem to put it on repeat straight after again, like put it straight on again OneRepublic deadly band.

God bless Tara focus focus you're listening to Tower after the navigation coach and this is living in Stereo. So we're just going to have the crack play some tunes have the chats and it's funny. I was kind of I was out for a walk yesterday evening and the evenings of starting to pull in a little bit and you kind of get that feeling of you know the back to school feeling for when you're a small good times. I grew up in Green Hills estate and the me.  Memories that I have from that estate are amazing and that whole dynamic of like front doors open and kids run in and out of houses. And I know sometimes in different areas now it's not kind of it's not the way it used to be people have to be a lot more safe and things have changed but I'm so glad that I have those memories and that I got the chance to kind of be in their time and  you know, we were out gallivanting from morning until night and my dad used to be looking for a small time. We're looking for you to have your dinner and Sherlock her she'd be only in trying to use this equation called so you could get out again them evens always just seemed so long and there was so much fun in your day and no worries. You know, that's the one thing my son as I said is 3 now when I look at him and I think on man good times it's that time in your life when you haven't got any worries.  Ask yourself today listening to me talk and like what are the worries that are in your head now? So like worry is a waste State and you hear people saying all the time, you know.  If action is the solution to a problem, then you don't have a problem.  So ask yourself for the stuff that's going on in your head instead of just been worrying and worrying and worrying and letting it go around in circles in the little hamster on the wheel is flat out wrong and ask yourself. What could you do about it? So is there an action there could be a solution to that problem because then you'll just make it disappear and see what parts of it are within your control and watching dudes can't take power back a little bit and sometimes those things are easier said than done but it does kind of brings you back.  Groans. Yeah, and it helps you to think about where you do have control as opposed to focusing on stuff that you don't have control over and I know when I work with people all the time, my office is based on there just near the cathedral and Bella. It's beautiful beautiful space. I was awful lucky to get us and that's something that I would hear from clients all the time that you know, when we actually talk it out that they spent a lot of time and energy focusing on stuff that they actually they can't impact they don't have the capacity to impact us. So think about the worries and ask yourself. Okay, what part of this?  Is in my control and what parts of it are outside of my control and try and get some perspective on it. It's amazing. Isn't it the things that we worry about no luck.  And sometimes you look back and times in your life when you be worrying about something and in hindsight as this is a great thing. You look back you think what in the name of God was like worrying about totally different perspective on it a few years ago, you know or later or it can seem like the biggest problem in the world at the time and then something bigger comes along later in life anything to yourself. Oh my God, that's also important to do that - look back at stuff that you've overcome in your life and remind yourself of your strength. If you hadn't gone through the trials and tribulations and the struggles you would never have learned the type of strength that you have.  So it's important to kind of sometimes take stock while moving so fast through life. We don't stop long enough to just read and say okay. Hang on a second. Where am I? What am I doing? What have I come through? What am I made of what have I learned all the questions? That's what coaching is. So constantly when I work with people you're asking questions. It's a fascinating world to be in I was really privileged to train in the Irish life audience to shoot in Dublin when I did and trained with the best of  Best of the best like amazing coaches and globally around and you know, hugely successful in their feet and just really beautiful people at the essence of it all and it was massive. It was a massive change for me. I definitely think the person that starts their course and the person they finished it were two different people. So I transformed in the middle of all of us and gotten all myself really well, so even though I was training to be a coach it was one of the biggest personal development Journeys I have ever gone on in my life saw.  So I had to be stripped back to my core and just exposed and allow myself to be vulnerable and it's scary like be honest. Melodic Ryan remember a few times driving from Dublin to Bonnie Carlin and cry and malls the way I was like Rocky Balboa rocking him fucking it to the Village the eyes swollen Ami head. Sometimes a good ol laugh as good as a a good Alki got outcry is as good as a good ow, laughs and if you're sticking with me, thanks so much.  I really appreciate the company. Don't be afraid to drop me and I'll message and tell me all the things. I'm doing wrong or all the things I'm doing right always seven seven one seven five one seven five and remember that you're listening to BC or FM tune me in at 101.9 FM or you can listen to me online at www.piofl.com visit radio, hashtag vocal about local not just class. I feel like I've done this before us but mad be careful. He's is my first time anyway as the talk and more the tunes.  Is this is a little beaut by what will I play? Dr. Doug? This is by Callum Scott. Actually, I think he was on Britain Britain's Got Talent. Some crackers have come out of them shorts. Some brutal ons is over some crackers and he was one of the ones that I really really admired. So this is called what I miss most so sit back and enjoy the Jones.  Must have been a huge I was thrown across an ocean far from home life is making no sense riding in between eyes and nose.         Jealous of the way that bird fly freedom on the people. Those quarter million stories passed me by       At the table all those faces, where did they go? I imagine what it looks like when I'm not there.     Class two nuts classroom. He's deadly isn't he he did an amazing duet with Leona Lewis as well. Really nice song look it up. You are the reason I think it's called its kind of the back and track and kind of played behind lots of Shores and stuff that's on at the moment. There was an amazing music out of love Island this year. So I didn't really get to watch too much of it. To be honest with you. Maura was a taught Legend what I can.  There when you go to see little bits of rubber shoes off on a and yeah, some of the some of the music that was played as part of the show the show was amazing. So there's definitely a playlist there on Spotify. If you have no look if you liked some of the music that was on and got a chance last weekend. I was in Dublin. So one of the things that I'm lucky enough to get to do as part of my job is I know train coaches and so I work for the Irish life coach Institute where I  I trained and I'm now lucky enough to train gorgeous. So I was in Dublin last weekend and got a chance to see the new Lion King Jesus on real.  I can't beat that like I remember watching it when I was small and smaller. I'm still dying. If I for one cello Force Class movie and the special effects in that are just unbelievable Larry. So I love just if you haven't got a chance to go and see it definitely do and Cinema here in Berlin as gorgeous and they run some Savage dealers. Well, I think they have like specials on a Wednesday and Thursday or something. I must look them up and I'll be able to let you know what their next week.  If you're just joining in thanks so much for listening to Tower after the navigation coach in this is living in Stereo, and we are flooding your Airwaves on BC or 101.9 FM and you're listening online as well. Hopefully to www.pctrf.org.  Send me in Somali news or Tunes are requests just a little hello to all weighed seven. Seven one seven five one seven five and be nice to have a bit of company and I get a chance maybe to read out of your messages the next time that I'm in and some of the books that I am listening to or reading at the moment. I get a lot of questions about that kind of stuff on Instagram, so can't be done or school just book. I love just reading.  Like to take one in to cast their on PS3 ballerina and just have an old read every now and again, but I'm also a big lover of audiobooks. I'm in the car a lot with work and even if your commute and like or work or you're like that even if you went in to cast any of your headphones, which are audio books are just a win like mobile University like you can learn stuff in the car or you can learn stuff when you're out for a walk or just kind of, you know, expand the brain.  And so the way that you can do it is you can download an app on your phone called Audible and then you purchase your books through Amazon amazing and you can buy credits or you can buy one sophs credits make your box work out cheaper, which is deadly so what am I listening to the minute? I am listening at the moment to a guy called your hand Harry and his book is called last connections. So he does like a deep dive into the world of depression and anxiety and he has looked at 9:00.  Contributory factors or what he believes are contributory factors to depression and anxiety and he explores all of them in detail based on a journey that he had with depression and anxiety really really interesting book and lots of insights and information and to us it's quite scientifically-based. So he would have looked a lot of clinical trials and there's a lot of evidence to back up the stuff that he's talking about and I found it really interested in some people have said it's a little bit controversial because it does  look at you know different aspects under that umbrella of depression and anxiety, but I think it's good to have fresh perspectives on these things and he's fascinating really interesting guy. He wrote a book before us but I have to be honest with you. I haven't read it and I don't know whole pile of Boulders, but I do know that last connections is amazing. So if you're someone that likes to read and you're not getting a chance to actually physically read audible is a winner and audio books are amazing. I got a chance as well actually.  You with the whole up and down to Dublin recently to listen to Michelle Obama's book becoming massive insight into the world of like the presidential campaign and the race and then life inside the White House from her perspective, which I thought was really interesting. So I suppose the spotlight. A lot of the time is on Iraq and kind of you know his journey and how he showed up and it but it's very much from the first lady's perspective as a woman as a wife and as a mother  Very refresh and she's well able to write and if you get the audible version, it's actually Michelle Obama that reads us, which is awesome. It's deadly to hear her voice and tell her own story. She's fabulous woman and she's you know really well educated well able to speak but she's a beautiful soul and she's beautiful person behind it all and which just makes the book like really her really enjoyable. So I would highly recommend that if you're looking for something new to pick up and read  Okay, let's have another tune. How about a little bit of Miss Kelly Clarkson? So this is broken a beautiful from the movie ugly dolls. That's out at the moment. I think you might like this one.    I never held my hand and asked for something free. I got proud I could roll up for miles in front of me. I don't need your help and I don't need sympathy. I don't need you to lower the bar for me. I know I'm superwoman. I know I'm strong. I know I got this cuz I've had it all along.  I don't need you to tell me who to be cancer.   Walking on the oceans turning water into wine, very emotional pretending. We're just fine. The only way to live now to know you're gonna fly line lies and the lies  I know I'm super warm. I know I'm strong. I know I've got this cause I've had it all.  Tell me who to be useless.   Sad and scared and out of time be wise without feeling like I'm failing and I'm losing my mind here. So just hold me.  Don't fix me. Don't you how to change a thing just know it's beautiful.      Kelly Kelly Kelly, she's some singer isn't she my God so she Rose to Fame in 2002 after the winning after winning the inaugural season of the reality competition series American Idol. Yes. I just read that off my phone because there's no way I would have known that but I remember watching back on her like audition tapes, you know, when you can kind of kick into YouTube and have a watch them on believable like from the get-go from the first song that she sang you were just like holy mother of divine God this girl can sing.  She's on real I think all her albums are just phenomenal. She's someone again, I'd love to see live haven't seen her either a couple of gigs. I was at this year. So it's good to reflect on that stuff and I went to my cousin to see Spice Girls phenomenal now, I liked them but I wasn't like one of the Diehard people and my cousin is the complete. I heard Spice Girls fan and we had Golden Circle tickets and Mother of God such a show. They put on like the energy that they had their dancers were just  Out of this world. They were absolutely amazing and I was lucky enough to get Auntie pink in the OR Dias. Now. I have another level of obsession with pink. It's not you know, I love her anyone that knows me will know that I can you know, I mean, I think they can vouch for me on that. She's phenomenal. I just heard the energy that she brings to our Shores if you have never got to see her live and you get the chance just go don't even question it don't even think about it. Just  go she's just  Emmys and again, I love everything that she stands for like as a woman as a mother She's Not Afraid for her voice to be heard in the world and I hugely admire that I like that level of authenticity and someone I think it's really important. I think in the world that we live in today. There are so many copies of copies of copies that it's refreshing to see someone just be who they are and not be afraid. I have a lot of respect for that. She's a phenomenal human being if you just joined us. Hello.  What's happening? You are listening to PCR 101.9 FM online at www.piofl.com.

spotify:episode:0NpimShyrctUgdqhKL4M6d	Hey neighbors producer Nate to Ford here. Now. We only have a couple weeks left of replaying some of our all-time favorite episodes composer of the my neighbors are dead Phim Jesse case and I collaborated on a show in Partnership between the Second City comedy theater in Chicago and Lyric Opera and it was a show based upon the life of vogner. Jesse case played Vagner and we got to throw. Ourselves into Germany and German classical music and I think that was probably the birth of where today's character came from. If you haven't heard this episode yet you're in for a treat this week. Jesse case discusses the human centipede and now  onto the show  Welcome back to another episode of my neighbors are dead. I'm your host Adam peacock. And we're all familiar with the big names and horror Freddy Jason the stuff but who are not familiar with the other ones just outside the tear ones who didn't get to tell their Tales now, I may have mentioned this in the past, but I am originally from Michigan. I love it there and whenever I get the chance to meet somebody who has never been to the state. I try my best to tell them how wonderful it is, but when we got Tim the Tool Man Taylor to tell you about Pure Michigan, I would just relent and show them that  Thankfully the toolman never had to smooth over any science murders from the state like this week's guest.    Hey neighbors Adam here, and I just wanted to check in real quick and say I like following all your Instagram pages. I watch what you're doing and who you're talking to. So, please feel free to creepily return the favor and check us out on Instagram Twitter at my dead neighbors or Facebook. We have a Social Media Group on there for movies called The Neighbors Film Society. You can come talk about movies movies that you like movies that you're watching. I've said it before and I really want somebody to do it and I'm sitting here with me. I want somebody who listens.  - oh who's made something to put it up there so we can watch it. I think that would be awesome. Oh, we will watch anything literally anything. Yeah. We there's a huge community of horror film makers in the midwest here and people, you know Reach Out wanting to be on the show to push them and while we don't do that. We are happy some dust links and we will absolutely watch anything. And as far as the neighbors Film Society stuff, you know, Adam and I we always talked about  what we used to do after movies for me. It was late night. Go to a Denny's or a Silverman's and Michigan and kind of debrief with our friends and mine was a Ram's Horn. Yeah and would just go talk about those films and we you know, we're just getting off the ground with this thing now, but we would love to have those same conversations. So some of the movies that I've seen lately in the theater that I'd love to talk about or things on Netflix Annihilation. I just watched the ritual which we learned about from a show we listen to which I thought  Great. Yeah, the ritual was fantastic and then I'm watching so many new things on shutter. Just watched cold hell which if you haven't seen it it is there is so much going on in this amazing. German film can't recommend it enough. It's on shutter. If you're not already a subscriber to shutter you can use promo code neighbors to get a full month free while you're trying it out see if it's for you. I can't recommend it enough check.  About Tara fire to that movie is pretty rad. Yeah. I haven't done that yet. I have you know what? I watched recently that I hadn't seen in a long time with Session 9. I bought that on DVD a long time ago. I love that movie. Have you seen that? I have not it's great David Caruso's in a classic also, give it a shout-out to the true heroes of our story the old ladies who served coffee at Denny's and Rams horns. And was that placement McGillicuddy's was that place Silverman's Silverman's? Yeah McGillicutty, you know, we drink coffee for four hours.  Probably yeah Tippett dollar. Yeah. Yeah talking about movies. We would never make the ways we make movies better that we like. Yeah, and here we are with a podcast which asshole anyway, so check us out on social media. All right. So while we've been be essing you can hear our theme song underneath us right now. This is an extended full rendition of run for it. The my neighbors are Dead theme song by our composer Jesse case, which you'll be hearing a lot of  Of this episode if you've ever wondered about where the idea for our theme song came from I talked to Jesse and he gave us a lot of great Insight on what was going on in his head at the time stick around after the show to here where you can get your own copy, and now here's a little bit from my conversation with Jesse case.  I'll tell you man. The timing of the timing of you asking me to do this track was like perfect because I had just downloaded for free. I think a plug-in on the Native Instruments platform called kinetic treats, which is by a dude named Jeremiah Savage who does he does a bunch of stuff with them? I think and you know his whole MO is at least for the work he does for them is all about finding non-musical sounds and turning them into kind of easily use  A musical patches and kinetic treats in particular has all this stuff that's just like tailor-made for the horror genre, you know, there's just like this creepy affected electric train. And then the thing I ended up using was the toy piano, which I sort of combined with some other stuff to make the at least, you know, kind of the build the core sample normally when I make short form music like podcasts themes or transitional music and sound design or any type of introductory music for a thing. You know, I'll make the make the core track first, which is  You know anywhere from 10 seconds to maybe a minute at the longest and then sometimes often like well after the fact I'll go back and look at it and be like, okay, this could potentially turn into this could potentially be expanded into something that's like, you know, quote unquote single length, I guess normally when I do that, I have a pretty good idea of what that end 3 to 4 minute track is going to sound like, you know, because all the main elements seem to be there like the drop or the hook or whatever. I want to call it in the main.  The T run for it actually surprised me though because as I was making it I started to realize there's actually like two or three separate parts to this like the drop isn't where I thought it was and there's this part is way longer than I realized it was and it ended up surprising me and I liked it and I hope you do too. Well. We love it. And we hope you do too stick around after the episode and you can hear how to get your own copy of run for it. The my neighbors are Dead theme without further.

I think it's impressive though that a  Project could you know you could bear the fruits of success with a passion project sure, if I'll and again lots of my business came from tourists, right which you know, I have of late because of the incident but you know have all but disappeared quite rightly. So before the incident your you were kind of thriving right? Yeah. Yes out of the tourism in your narrative, but Southeastern buffer areas such a beautiful area. You've got the East signs in rivers. You've got to see  you've got sick all the Gothic architecture Spa Casanova. You know, I played once is that right? Yes. How was that? I was great eye open for Three Dog Night you open for three dogs are fantastic. I love three dog night. They're great. One of my favorite bands one of my favorite American groups. Yeah. We got a couple of them over here as well. I would love to keep talking to you about the success that you had before the incident, but I guess that's kind of kind of why we're here because of the incident. Yes. Well, yes it is.  All you hear Wells incident of course was the the centipede the human Center for Human Centipede. Yes, and of course our dear. Dr. Joseph cheerful who is yeah. Do you know did you know him before any of this? Cause he's a pretty pretty successful guy. I mean, yeah separating. Yeah siamese twins not easy. Dr. Cheerful was a very very you have to understand in in Germany.  Surgeons are like rock stars. Sure because we have an obsession with like with like cutting people open. Is that all that you know, what? Well yes likes, but okay, but now when that means that probably didn't translate like we have an obsession with like looking at the insides of people know, okay, we have a we have an obsession with  Medicine like the medicine. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah medicine is a great profession. It's a great thing to look into. Okay. I'm sorry. I'm a little nervous because my English is not very good. No, your English is great Alfonso. He like I mean, I understand that by American Standards is great Germans timing. No. No, this is not cut it but I would I be able would my English fly in Germany or is my English. Terrible Germany TBA, okay.  God okay. So dr. J. Dr. Joseph Schneider cheer for height has translates to this cheerful. Oh, okay. I don't know that I know fun thing. Dr. Cheerful cheerful. Dr. Heiter. Yeah, so he's kind of like a rock star where you're from Boswell, you know, he was he was reclusive sure, you know, but up until the human centipede incident where he sold three people together Master but Master, but yeah with 100% medically accurate suit  It was the incident he was sort of the was a different type of reclusive. It was like, I don't know. Who is there. Who is there a rock star who's known for being a recluse like like yours The Edge or your your your Cat Stevens? Yeah. Yeah. I'm curious to so when you find out that he's sold three people together as to mouth after Mouse out in his downstairs laboratory in his house. What are you most taken aback by the  the fact that he did it or the fact that it's 100% medically medically accurate.  A bit of Botox to be honest. Yeah, I have to say I mean like beings that we are so interested in the inner workings of the body. Yeah as a German culture right medicine. Yeah, you know, it is sort of like was not it's like one half of me is disgusted and the other half is like yeah, I could see that I feel the same way. I think actively it's interesting. Nope. That's not no. No, it's not object. No, it's um, no, I think you're right.  Objectively it is no no, no wheat no, and for all of those listening at home, we do not in Bavaria finds this interesting. We find it horrible and we find it at oh, it's a it's a it's an outlier. Okay, you know and see here's the thing about like, it's just the ways that rumors spread the you know, suddenly we are so varied it. There's so many other places in Germany that are only known for one thing, right? You know what I mean, of course like you got to do  During Berg, you've got Berlin. You've got Dresden. You got Munich - ha yeah.  To a certain extent Germany in general not. Oh, no you like White's great pastries in Nuremberg. Yeah, but if you if I say to you Nuremberg, what do you think of nothing? Great, right? Yeah. Exactly. Nothing great. Great food. Just sitting sounds of Windows going to faced. Yeah. It's a it's a real. It's a blemish on your On The Run directly and next thing they'll on shoot. Yeah, and the entirety of Bavaria are at risk right now of being known for one thing.  Which is one single doctor in his house sewing people Mouse to but Mouse to budmouth two buttons and injecting them with some vitamin so they didn't die. That's I the fact again I the fact that it's a hundred percent medically accurate is it's incredible to me, but I understand where you're coming from it and it's not great. So not a good situation, you know and just rumors spread and suddenly like, you know, like what is  What is the what is the children's it's a there's a word for it a children's game. It is a children's game where even children are at recess sitting quietly on the bench thinking about the lesson of the day. They sometimes play this game which is where one person passes something to somebody else a telephone. Thank you. Yes. Yes, and then that as a person passes it to somebody else but at that point it is completely different. Yeah and on and on, you know, thud like through three people maybe more  Maybe up to 10. I feel like this is something like when you do something dumb in high school and you're kind of known for that for the rest of high school or in college exactly. You're like no. I'm so many other things than just the one time. I did this stupid thing. It is so frustrating. We have a saying in German that translates roughly to it feels like screaming into a dark hole Yeah Yeah, I can see how that we talk to a guy not that long ago who was kind of helping a girl who crapped her pants at a party take revenge on people because that's all she was kind of known for it.  She was pretty pissed about that through the internet great. Anyway, so talk to me now about how does tourism how is that affected by this? So I have things are kind of things are great. Right prosperous. People are coming to your to your shops to your coffee shop there here and you play your music which you brought a guitar. I mean, yeah, so I did yes. Well, that's his part is I so I have sort of been I have joined a task force put together by some board of Tourism of the  Of lunch shoots the county seat of Southern Bavaria to try and sort of figure out what are we going to do? How do we get people to not associate Bavaria visit a doctor who sold a bunch of people together asked her mouth as the mouth you guys go into panic mode right away, or do you kind of think maybe if we just don't talk about it people won't talk about it or do you is this like damage control right away? We gotta tell people that it's not just about ask them out here. And yes exactly value. No sort first like first we were just sort of  Trying to stay quiet about it sure, you know and we sort of gave people the benefit of the doubt but you know, it's like I say rumors spread and next thing, you know, we see a significant drop in to particularly young Collegiate Americans who make up the majority of our demographic Lindsay and Jenny to of Yas, they were not they did there wasn't favorable for them. Right exactly. So here so picture this okay picture this  You are going this is sort of the typical tourist experience. Yeah, you going you're in Holland. You're having fun. You're partying. Yeah, you do you're having a mushroom. I like that. Yes, you dry. And you want to go to Italy sure. Yeah, but you don't want to go through Austria, right? We got that zeros. So you drive south you drive south you rent a car obvious thing. Don't fly Ryanair careful gross cheap, but  gross right know you rent a car you drive through the beautiful landscape down through the rivers and the dark dark trees and our beautiful complicated Autobahn which is the most complicated system of highways in the world by far and you drive through a next thing, you know, you decide to stay at a motel you find a beautiful little more tell you are you are going out to restaurants. You meet a lovely Vater next thing, you know, you're driving through the forest. Boom. You're at a nightclub. You're partying you're at  Bunker right bunker is our famous nightclub in the land should are it is actually closer to our Munich, but it's like right between okay. Yes. It's sort of lovely little area called muhsin touring which is a lovely little town with a beautiful night club scene go figure, but that is South East Germany always surprising you are most nightclubs in the woods neuro. Yeah. Well that's sort of like the thing, you know, they're like you have you know, it's sort of like it's annoys thing and it's also just like  You know when you're clubbing in Germany, you know, like I'm John and I'm saying is like yeah what happens in geese reporting stays in Keystone hoardings that going anywhere, right? Exactly. So and there are a lot of clubs most of which I was realizing is that compiled a list have like a real sort of like warlike, uh-huh names which is sort of weird. So there's like bunker which is the main fun. But then there's like a crater is great. There's like a deep concrete the good one. There's just one called Extreme.  Which is lots of fun. There's a let's see carpet bomb is great. Gravity's rainbow. That's like a more obscure one. Yeah reference fits do they do they drink specials these places? Oh, yeah absolutely likes are seeing my favorite drink says all steamy Colton. Oh, what's that translates as and then they came from me. Oh, okay gin-based. Very good. Huge in man. Yeah, but yeah, Germany man. Yes, I can't do the juniper berry baby. Play the piece OK. It's ok on the paleo diet to which will really  Wrong. Oh, yeah, you have a paleo diet. Oh everyone in Germany. Is this five-year? So sin and beautiful and smart. There are so many Alphonse. I can't keep track. I heard it one called the Kinko diet or the ginkgo diet or something like that. There's a lot of that's a fun for you eats. The lizard's I think that's right. Yeah, I think that's right. Okay. Yeah, so, okay. So now there's a great club scene is beautiful. Yes. It's such a wonderful Drive-Ins and all you have to do is like to get to Italy afterwards is Drive South so like 50 miles at most throughout Syria, which is  You know, that's about as much Austria's you can take its the ice tree has the shape we call it like the was it was a translation like the dirty foot? Yeah. Yeah. It's like the little part that sort of sticks under Germany and bothers everybody. Yeah. The dress is Argos was the mainland and send you on Italy your vacation is wonderful. You take away whatever you take away. So these are great. I mean this sounds awesome. The only thing that bothers me is the Joseph cheerful live in there. Yeah, exactly. But you know, I mean that guy Joseph cheerful is one of a kind  Kind and to those of you listening at home. Please knows that all of the rest of the many surgeons who work on siamese twins in the area are perfectly normal. Are there a lot of Siamese twins? Where you from?  Not anymore. Okay, great. Well, I'm excited because I'm I'm happy that you came here to talk to us about this to put the word out there that it's not just about ass to mouth where you're from you brought a guitar. Yeah. I'd like to you have some songs. I'd like to hear some some songs about how great it is where you're from. Yeah laughter the bucket people's hearing hundred percent web. So, you know a little bit like this is sort of like we have a say is house has many rooms. Yeah, most of which are hidden deep in the basement.  Right and it is totally like so this is this is just a sort of say like there is more to Bavaria than meets the Casual glance of those who have only heard about the human centipede. Which again is there somebody sewed three people together as two mouse asked him as 100% match exactly more to Bavaria than meets the eye Alphonse help. Oh, I'd love to hear some of these songs represent. Yes. Well, and again, these will eventually be used for like tourism videos or perhaps radio spots that sort of thing just to get the word out.  Yeah, yeah squash these rumors right here 100% Exactly. All right. I'm a it's must admit. I'm a little nervous. Oh, don't be nervous. This is great. I've only am I thought I sent these to my dog and said, oh, yeah, we have another saying in Germany, which is before you try something on people. Try it first on your dog. He did it in the dog's ready showed three dog's ass to mouth, right?  Oh, I'm sorry. No, no that I should have I should have seen the parallels now. That's my bad. I'm sorry. Okay. So this is sort of like a I'm sorry. There is another saying oh nice another words that I don't know. It is a musical. It's a musical term there like you have like one one you have like three parts of a song. Okay, and you like push them all together?  Like all front front to back even though they don't necessarily belong together, but then say what's it's like a musical term for it a medley. Yay. Yay. Yay.  Okay. So this first song is just about like, you know, it's just if this is about like lunch shoot, okay, I'd like a little more experimenting with maybe a motto. Okay? Okay by lunch you yes a long the finding Autobahn. So startling and complex. Who knows what his next your map is useless. So many unmarked roads What secrets will you find in the forest at night?  Come get lost in line should get lost. Totally lost. What will happen to you. No one knows fun surprises. Come get lost in line shoots completely and totally lost you may never get where you thought you were going to go.  And then moving on to the second part of this is okay. That's another seconds is the second part system the middle part. I'll catch you know, it's quite frankly as the first part just that's just sort of my experience with it. Okay, give French people different languages different diets. What fun when different people come together as far as Bavaria Better Together?  Right, there is no other love is an infection. You can't help but can't - then you and a total stranger are hopefully a match in Bavaria. You have no choice you'll soon become attached Sinai. So yeah, that's a lovely one and that's just sort of like the here's the third one. Let's see. This is the end part This is the End party exactly. Yeah for the way.  Which is like probably the ones that were like die first, will you be calm Vaudeville Germany turn you into Vans you disappear and to the trees beauty that will permanently bring you to your knees.  Traveling through Germany means permanent changes permanent changes becoming something totally new you and a friend and another friend traveling through Germany means permanent changes. He reversible when you come to Germany, then you come to Germany. You literally may never return I'll  Well that feels nothing at all. Right. Thank you. Those are great. So, yeah, it's just the goal behind all of those songs is to make people not to associate Bavaria this doctor cheerful who sewed three people asked her mouth. Yeah as to mouth. Yeah. Those are really those are good songs and you're aiming that primarily at an American audience. Ideally go out to like, you know an American audience, of course, particularly.  Really like Collegiate women aged 20 to 25 right looking for a good time. Right demographic. Yeah. Absolutely. You know, like that's a lot of The Travelers we see, you know, we used to see like a fair amount of ballet students, you know, but oh, is that right? Yeah, but then that stuff happened over in Freiburg. It's you know Stan's Dance Academy and it was like, you know, yeah next thing, you know, like, you know towns is the new Nuremberg and nobody's going to know he's going to have as a pastry. So you guys are a little behind the barn. That's how I feel. Like you're you're bad way below 300 on these those feels to me like every single time.  In Germany soon is going to be known for Von horrible thing. I'd like that's just the password on and does nothing you can do about it. Let's change that today, huh? Thank you, Adam. Let's try that talk to me. What's the Japanese Market looking like for these songs because there was a cop sir. Oh, I believe I'm saying his name, right? He was the the head of the yeah. Yeah. So he was the first part of the song. Well, yeah. What nothing. What's that? You're going to Market? This is and go all over. Absolutely. Yeah hundred percent.  Yeah everywhere particularly. Yeah, you know and totally coincidental eater Japan and yeah our particular American demographic. I'm just going to I don't want to tell you how to do your art.

spotify:episode:5ezIpq1OHmHWH5fN09vvDm	 Hi Gareth Williams from the boxing shop here. Thanks for listening to our podcast today today. I've got Jack Bowen who is one of Australia's leading amateur boxers big career ahead for Jackie's been doing it since he was 13 14 years old and you're welcome Jack, you know, go good mate, very good. So we've been putting questions out to on Instagram and social media and has been quite a few people. I suppose sending questions in that they'd like to ask about you a bit about and get to know get to know you I suppose so join. It gives a bit of a rundown on the background of yourself what you do fight, so I don't know how you got into it that sort of stuff. Well, first of all, I started when I was about 12 or 13 and I came down the box and Shop under yourself and I was playing AFL at the time. I wanted to get for putting in the preseason and the best way for me personally to do that was to come down the block. And I just fell in love with the sport. I still kept on playing I felt throughout my teens just as a little bit of a distraction from boxing as you know, it can get a bit full-on sometimes and just to have a balance with mates playing a team sport as well was good. That's funny because a lot of people do exactly the same thing. I got in a box exactly the same way playing footy got injured when the local boxing gym and never went back to Footy forget. I just fell in love with it and just the people you meet through  seeing as well. Mmm. Just genuine people and I fell in love with the atmosphere at the boxing shop. Yeah as well and I also gone back to my life at the moment. Yeah. I'm working part-time or working outside school hours Care at the moment. So that keeps me busy on the side and pretty much boxing full time as well. Yeah nice and you buy your a recently at University, but you're deferring at the moment. Is that right? Yeah. I had to defer just I think I'm going to  Try and put all my eggs in one basket to make the world championships coming up. And yeah, that's pretty much my sole focus at the moment and I couldn't uni even know I was with I was part-time study. It's a massive time consumption for me personally like it was it was just a bit too much especially with the training load. We have been doing trips away trying to manage. That was a bit. Yeah. Just got a bit too much and stressing me out instead of just focusing on my boxing, which is what I need to do. Cool.  So you we bought a victoriaboynton Queensland I was born in your book, but your parents are from Victoria every else Victoria foreigners cricket, and I have Alex obsessed. So that's probably what an awesome cricket and I felt that was my first love and then boxing kind of it later on and I seen you've got a you got a sisterly met who actually send us a question in who's your favorite sister? Yeah. It is a it is such as I live.  Yattawan, if there was another one she been sick and spot maybe some of the mood she has he probably would be but she's more obsessed with I felt and I think yeah, she's she's a lunatic that's all she seems to talk about is 40 and then we'll 40 season's over. She doesn't get around the cricket. So she's just stuck waiting for the funniest. She's just stuck right for pre-season has been training who's your footy team Western Bulldogs footscray?  Have I gone at the moment? Yeah, not too bad. I don't think it's just that feeling out process at the start of the year, but we're only on the right path. That's normally what team say when they're losing and they losing or winning. No lost a couple. Yeah, really? Yeah. I think we won the premiership two years ago. Oh, no three years ago. Yeah throw you have maybe three. Yeah. I miss that. I actually miss the Grand Final guy. I was in Ireland at the time. Yeah, we had two weeks in Ireland.  Celtic cop. Yeah, it was 2016 and I stayed in Dublin a few extra days and then on my flight back I landed in Sydney and I have my Bulldogs scarf and beanie on and everyone in Sydney because we played Sydney come up to me and said that we'd won so so you're promoted a little bit for me because I wanted to go home and watch it. But I guess I asked for it. Well, unfortunately the world now you like there's no secrets and I nothing I got it on DVD I can watch it back whenever I want if you miss a fight now.  On TV like you hit up your geeky social media everything. You can't check any special every time I want to notify. It was all don't even go to BoxRec anymore. Just go straight to yes Flora page. And yeah, that's right highlights pop up. All right, cool. So you love you boxing. We've got we've got a lot of questions here to get through a few different people have sent similar questions. So we'll just we can bounce a few of those off each other. I suppose one of the questions is how did how did you get into?  Acting and why do you do it? What what is it about boxing that you love and I suppose you've already answered how you got into boxing through your football you come down for a bit of training and what is it that keeps you going Keith? We don't buy actually, I'm just obsessed with the sport. Like I actually love like constantly watching boxing and I love the competitiveness that it brings out of me when I'm at training and when sparring and and just constantly improving and getting better. I think.  What if I ever get to the stage in boxing where I don't feel like I'm learning or I feel like I'm just staying in the same place. I think I'll just give it away doing because at the moment, I just feel like I'm obsessed with just constantly learning and improving and and I think as a I think it's a sorry. I think it's a sport where you can never stop learning. Yeah, but that I think yeah, that's the thing is if I feel like I'm not like yeah. Yeah, I don't know right? Yeah. That's right. I think it's more on myself. If I don't want to learn. Yeah. Yeah for sure.  I suppose on that giving up then on the other hand. This is not a question by somebody this is just what I'm throwing out there. So, you know, you get some people they just stay too long in the sport. You want to know when your time's up to and I right that's what even the best thing is. I trust you so much with my career and Chiara and yeah people here that if it ever came to that stage, I know you tell me yeah that looks that's tall enough. Yeah. Yeah, but I bet if he's on let's hope these are four ways. Like I just I just love the sport. I love competing. I love  that competitive nature and constantly also like proving people wrong as well. I like I like having a dig and I was insane when I'm when I was a young kid. Yeah, if I'm 40 or someone had picked me for a team that I'd show you the next week. Why? Hey that's good. Why I didn't want to why you should have picked me or yeah, and I think that's the that's the reason why the state amateur before the Olympics and World Championships at you as only prove people wrong, and I want to  I'm going to get the I want to show people. Yeah that I could do this. Yeah, that's excellent. And it's not a lot. So going off that off this little roll into another question that we've got. So somebody's asked how do you manage your mental preparation before a fight? So what are your thoughts and this person also wants to know what are your thoughts immediately is UN to ring in these stepping up the stairs what's running through your head? And it does that does that continue throughout the fight or you thinking different things during the fight?  I think the so the first part was the mental prep mental prep for before fought I think for me. I just need to like I like to be in control with my with my boxing. Yeah and like you get that through your training that when it comes to thinking about the fight. I've I've been in track sessions before and you get to the last couple of sets of for hundreds or something like why am I doing this? And I think for me the mental thing is  I just want to I want to be at the World Championships or I want to  I want to go to if you think about that goal that you want where you want to be or or why you're doing it is because I want to go to Worlds and that's where I struggled last year. Yes because obviously called games and come through for me. So I was doing track sessions like Midway through the year you get to the last 70 available. Why the fuck am I doing is it really worth it? And you don't have that big goal if this is this is why yeah, and I think just thinking  Thinking back to what your goal is and why you're doing this war when you're in those tough sessions that for my mental prep. And as far as got into the ring, I think I let me just jump on that one there because there was another question throwing that somebody said when training gets tough what motivates you I suppose you've just answered that as well in the same question when when you're running on the track and you're done you on your seventh 400 millimeters in you just absolutely fucked and you've got three to go. Well, what does get you through? I suppose you've answered.  Boy having that going funny. Would you say that you just just holding a cell and and knowing that?  People around the world on as fortunate as me and I have this opportunity to like we can run on pristine tracks. Yeah, we get recovery. Yeah, that's right everything. Give it like I'll give it to us, but it's there if you will have access to all these things and why should be taking advantage of that when my opponent maybe he's from 100 gram Russia Ukraine, maybe they don't have that opportunity anywhere. I need to find that hunger that they have just to do box here. And I know you would have seen that when you had to Cuba where boys have had  Got Runners on and hearten. I remember are complaining about you know, Helena three sets of boots. Yeah. Yeah. That's right. Yeah, exactly. It's just about putting things into perspective. I remember we went over there with Luke Jackson the Bella boys the Maloney boys. There was Jason whateley there's quite a few Hoops Cameron have it has a really good team is a good team boys. It's a pretty good team given guys. Like we were our guys were giving away Runners to these Cuban Guys and some of them work.  Cutting there were two smaller. They had them they were cutting holes in the end of the shoe. So they the toes would fit through it. It's unreal, and that's why you got to find out so hungry, but they're so hungry to win a fight because they need to get out of that situation. And I think I've gotta find that's what motivates me to be better because I've got everything like Australia was so great. We're so blessed and we should be grateful for what we have here. So you need to  Look at your own situation that I'm here. I need to push hard as hard as these boys are in the welder if I'm going to compete with you nice. Oh, yes, I suppose. What was the second part of that question? Yeah, when you are suppose you're going from your dressing room to the ring. What's on your mind then, you know what's in your mind. I just I'm like, I guess people take their differently, but for me, I just like to be relaxed and I'll actually go through my punches go through much stretching and  And I like to talk and have conversation and you know, I like to joke around a bit one before I get into the ring but constantly reminding myself that just giving myself the confidence. I've done the work. Yeah, I remind myself that I'm on this level. Yeah, I feel I'm better than these people and that's just all in my head whether the fight goes that way or not. I told herself before every fight. Yeah, you're the man, you know, it's yellow and it has to be that way sometimes.  Well, I think a lot of times remember when you were a bit younger and you're a Jew, you know, he looked up and watched a miracle all the time. You just love these starving. You did any sugar in the gym together. Remember? I used to just say to you before every fight Hooper attitude who braditude and it was all the time. It was like because he had this attitude at a young age that he could beat anybody in the world where a lot of people don't they have that fear and they let the few beat said, yeah. Well sorry to cut you off but that confidence for me didn't come until I was probably  Bleah 79 in but maybe even 1890, you know, you just you have those first few late fights at ya. And ya I call I am I going to be strong enough with these boys and then after it, I forgot fights and I'm spying on people like Damian who parole murder? Yeah. Well great. Carol home like jock Pros. What what's to say? I can't go in here and why shouldn't I be confident when these boys at the pro level yea unreal. Yeah, that's right. And when I come back to the amateurs it so I take that confidence from those.  Pause and I've done the work and yeah, that's that's that's that's perfect. So I so write your so let me take you back to again this one, right? So you've that's the way you think right. Normally. We have a bit of a we have a little hug at the bottom of the stairs from that time to actually  Stepping up actually walking up the stairs the next 15 seconds after the walking up the stairs stepping through the ropes standing in the corner move it around what's on are you thinking much then or you just it's time to do this is the love it. Yeah, let's just use living that moment that I've done everything. Yeah. I always get I always get a little bit nervous like before that moment. Yeah. Is your hug Yara you and then I walk in there. And the first thing I do is they'll big big lap of the range. Just you know, like this is It's nowhere  This is where yeah, I did my work and then get back to the ring. I usually do the sign of the cross. Yeah, and then from probably the first 10 seconds. I'm a little bit. I'm really cautious. Yeah, and then from then on I just know it. Hi you guys it's my game. That's what I've trained hard for so nice. So another part of that question. What are your thoughts during the fight? I if I was answering that this is not a throne of me obviously, but if I was answering this, I would say it's constantly changing.  And it's it's living in the mou Hazard. Yeah, you have as soon as you get it in that you have to adapt to every circumstance under way. So if like when I get in there, I might even try like a couple fights just to see what tactic might work. Yeah, because if I faint and he cut his backhand  And he reacts differently to what I expected then your whole game phone's going to change a little bit like you're talking to change the whole it'll change that little bigger and you don't know what they're gonna throw so you're trying you faint and then as soon as that confidence just builds and builds that by like people say that my Instagram highlights of May draw from my hands. And and I think we've got a question here somewhere and there was a bit about like Drop. Why do you drop your hands in your fights? And I've seen are you here boxing with your hands down? Is it a stir?  All you've taken to yes, I shorten that question. But because I got direct message on Instagram about that is I see in your training videos how your practice with great technique and like as we do here at the gym. And and when you punch the bag you don't drop your hands or when you're done your Shadow, you don't drop your hands, but in your fights, it seems like you do but in my highlights only show that that fans.  How many how many times in that first maybe two minutes of the round you see me with my hands up. Yeah, I never happens. It doesn't happen. America's got a as I can get caught up and one my reflexes and my tactics haven't come along that earlier than that because I can't do the things I need to do. Yeah, as far as the van that one thing we've always said I'm out of all I said that to you is live from other people's mistakes. Yeah. Well, I've been in this gym with some of the pedigree of people boxes with hardened Damien Cameron Hammer. Yeah.  I've got to learn are some of the best you you Olympians that Australia's producer Last probably 10 15 years. I've I've always been cautious of getting caught early. Yeah, and then as we said and the same that we've seen that energy and that can happen to anybody and it's a shame of it happens to someone but I've just got to take that is a learning experience. Yeah, that's right while I'm still a mature to you is I know once in turn pro and you put on those small gloves and yeah my mistake.  Laughs. Yeah, I just can't get caught up. Yeah, that's hot. Yeah, that's good. So what we're should we got next? Okay. Well, let's try this one. This is a bit. What's your favorite part of all time to watch like what fight excites you and you can just watch it all the time for me. I don't watch that that much of the old-school boxing. Yeah as much as maybe people think assured I am I'm just I love this. Yeah. Well, it's the generation.  Yeah, I've grown up in is but how many times do you watch a full fight now or you probably would but my generation is all right. Well, what's the quickest access? I'll watch five minutes or highlights your I can pretty much do everything. So like on-demand. Yeah, it's the world's different. Well was that the the best fight like I've seen recently for me that I actually got like a big feeling from was the Triple G Canelo the first one. Yeah, I didn't think Triple J.  Yeah, the decision I thought he did enough to win but that forcefully like I was standing at what else have you ever checked a box of yellow and even before that I am like the fights that actually got me up and excited by have to be like watching it live in the yeah. Yeah, you have to I think yeah, and another one for me was obviously when Jeff Horn one I was not aware. Why would I mean there was yeah. It was amazing because I was like you just wanted him to win so bad and even I don't know was it Jason the line? He's last.  Adding is under last night. Yeah. Yeah for that against all the cheese is it's can't remember the name, but I remember watching it and in that super seriously, / I watch that and I would have called you. I thought I was a cracker absolute cracker, but that's as far as my favorite fighter of all time. Yeah, I haven't watched too many the classics apart from highlights. Obviously, like obviously control watch like Micky Ward. Yeah, Tara Gaddy Trilogy and the Marquez Pacquiao fight.  Yeah, that was well what what let's flip that around. What's what's the favorite fight of yours that you've been involved in might be when you are ten years old. It might be last fight favorite right fight the view of had whether You've Won or lost because this the question come from somebody. So whether You've Won or lost what is your favorite fight you've had and why is it it's a you beat the odds you you got belted and it was the best Learning lesson because let's be honest. You had a few losses early on like everybody got lost.  Are you going to ask her about maybe 25 so I probably would have been even tent and you know and the like as a young kid, that's that's a frustrating thing. Yeah. Yeah, and that's probably why I didn't invite them to come watch me for a long time as because we're confidence wasn't there. Yeah as a boxer because because then you might think you got belted. Yeah, you know, I don't want to box here. And yeah, it sounds like that's never a just Russia House and what am I supposed to do? Like, I've only been taught the Box  Get put in with good boxes, and I was fine. Yeah, but answer made the biggest something that stands out something stands out. Well not too short to be honest. I think fighting over you not Germany for the first time. Yeah anything for me. I think that was probably the biggest learning experience as far as like, we did the New Caledonia trip. Yeah early on which was good, but just going there and it slowly. Yeah and then fighting in Germany against people like I'm on the set.  Second fight night we had there. I remember every on this is like like I thought the hometown kid and everyone was against me and that was something different for me because I've only for differs but yeah, well, I thought it'd be afforded like Sydney or something. Yeah, I like is a few people but no one really not really it's yeah, that's why this atmosphere was like every other again and I thrived on it. I loved it. Yeah, that was probably the biggest learning. I for me and he was a man. I thought I was 19 at the time. It was a 2015 was 19 at the time that that was a big change.  So I'll admit I took Confidence from that trip to come back here. And then I remember we went to China for that training camp Nationals and I had a really good National yet as well. Yeah, that's right. That's probably the biggest one I learned from and being in with a man. Do you credit do you enjoy that you enjoy the well, obviously 2017. We ran the elite boxing championships as well, which is on television on ESPN every week. It was on for 10 weeks and that was you know, that was a big thing.  NG where I personally said let's do this because everyone said you can't get amateur boxing on television. So I've just got two more fuck this. Let's have a crack and we got the sponsors. We sold tickets would use everything and it was amazing. But what we wanted to do with through that we wanted to give the boxes the special field the lights the camera the action that smokescreen the interviews the everything that Pros fight and you know, what amateur boxing over three rounds with no head guards on anymore.  Why wouldn't you watch it? Yeah, it's exhausting table is reponsible. Remember every week nearly every maybe twice a month. Yeah or once a month. We're fighting the best. Yeah, which is against the best amateur. That's not it's not old late. Yeah. I did not will payments on five hundred bucks a head driver from yeah the Philippines like this is their actual really good boxes. Yeah over-50s yet fight fighting each other and they're like, yeah, that's right. Yeah, there's a that was  ABC really helped me with that as well. Just don't get interviews and get a confidence in that I'm ready for this next look at guys. Yeah, and for me like as you know, the amateurs is  I'd love to go to the Olympics. Yeah, and that's the goal. The goal is world champion yet then Olympics, but for me, the Ultimate Golf is to toe professional become a world champion. Yeah, and I love the show you love people Everyone watching you and yeah and the lights and cameras the action. Yeah, and I just think everything's good with timing and doing everything the right way. We can have that when we go pro but to have it while I was still a  She was a beauty that's what we couldn't it was also like I'd have feel the boys come down watching. Yeah, and to see what it's about and to see what if I turned down a beer. This is probably why yeah, you're not sure I believe so he speak about turned down me up. You've had a few birthdays. We haven't even celebrated haven't even know school is because a boxing and that sort of stuff. Yeah hundred percent. I had no no schoolies. So I'll send the exact. No schoolies 1808  And then like the big ones 21st as well. No 25 I had to make it was for so that leads us into more questions that get thrown out us your big goals of it where you've discovered that one. That's another question immediately. It's World Championships championships Olympics given everything goes to plan and then after amateur boxing amateur boxing is finished. It's where we going.  Away, yeah luck for me. That's always been a big goal. And are you going to be world champion? Yeah, of course said that's what I want. Excellent.  That's it. And you just do the right thing. We you know stepping up at the right time and the right because everything's time and for me as we said about the entertainment side of Roxy. Yeah, when I turned Pro, I don't want to just be a lot like you got to do you reproduce you're going to Paris. But yeah, like I want to be able to run it the way I want to run it. I don't know. I just get stuck in in the norm of Australian boxing which is just  Farting in and no Showmanship no entertainment or no reason for people to come watch you and that's why I'm trying to build it while I'm still amateurs. That's why I put the highlight videos out and just trying to do different things. It's not my differently. It's happening just in my tummy feels like an extra people might come watch me. Yeah, but it's ten that weren't there if I wasn't I wasn't putting myself out there because that's how people should think. Yeah. That's what I told you young Fighters want to see them now so a couple of the boys last week at the fight.  Got the Gold Coast. I told them when when they're doing their social media stuff. I think it's it's such a good thing to see young boys problems out there to to promote themselves that and by the time they're my age now, they'll have one my 5,000 more people that want to come watch over you and what I do now. Yeah, because if I had my time again, I would have I would have been a Relentless with it. Yeah, because I think if you hesitate to put yourself out there, then you're never gonna get anywhere. Yeah.  And and to see those young boys doing that. It's I think they and they feed off that confidence that if I say that's a I don't know in might not know and then it is ok, as you looked up to others. It's now you're tellin ya because their social media is really more my age. Now then say yeah the boys before me so they couldn't really give me game on that. But now I want to kind of try and help them out as well because I think as  As a young kid you hesitating even I used to when I was about 15 16. If you post a photo after you win I'd get so hesitant about putting it up. Well now these boys are just like putting training videos up years misfiring videos. Here's just content for people to learn what's going on and it's taken me how many years to be able to do that. So and they've got to be smart with it though or making yourself look good doesn't mean you don't destroy the other people, you know what I mean? Some people it's all about like  You know, you can put yourself out there you put you know, you should be putting pumping out content all the time to improve yourself get what you're worth. But you know, you don't you just going to the people who have to do the right thing and these young kids using it. It's great to do it. They need to push it hard. They don't need to be bagging others as they do it themselves. It's about them and their supporters and building what they do and you know what life's about relationships. If you're good to people people will give it back to you and I think that comes back to you your own character as well.  If you're if you're willing to do that and like I'm just saying put your content out there. You can kind of see us. Yeah, if you put a little bit of a highlight of you give it to someone but don't be disrespectful with it. That's right. Yeah, and a lot of the times I can put up a video of Me Maybe putting someone in a town. Yeah, but it's the it's the message as well. Yeah, like I'm not putting captions up like yeah come get this or like yeah, who was that the shit out of that, but that's not me either if that's you go for it, but it's  The contact we expect the backlash from that you shine parts and you just got to be smart and educated and we what you do on social media because people can take things the wrong way. Oh, yeah. Everyone's offended these days as well. That's right. Here should be really careful. Yeah. No, I think you're doing excellent with it. Yeah, and I and I think that for me that's not really my character. Like I'm I'm confident in my ability, but I'm not going to go out of my way to your master question. I'll answer it but I'm not gonna go out of my way to put  Else down or you don't come back soon. So inspiring to all these professional and Australia was I said, like like I'm happy to talk and be confident. Yeah, but and he goes, yeah, but just never break your own character and I think and that's where he's I learned a lot from that conversation was you know him telling me that you don't need to break her at character to be successful. Yes. What and I think that's that's true people like in a low and yeah. Yeah anniversary.  Like if he gets asked the question, yeah, I'll answer it. I'll beat that person, but he doesn't go out of his way to be a dick about just yeah detrimental was disrespectful. So I suppose off that what's your best advice in you boxer to a new boxer obviously has lots of guys in our gym and in gyms all over the world that they you know, they might look up to people like your your early twenties now lucky you looked up to people and their you're still looking up to people in your state. You still do but to a young kid that wants to start wants to be a  Big tall boxer what would you say to them apart from that obviously give advice to Young Box about their social media what they should and shouldn't do what else what other advice would you give to young person? I just just be yourself with as far as what we're talking about. There was being yourself and just back yourself as well. You've got a but I don't think when I was really young I didn't back myself as much as I should have not as confident as I should have been and I've only  Gain, that confidence as like through being an adult and yeah. Yeah, I'm good boys as yeah to be confident and back your own ability, I think and that's the thing I are you know, a lot of people want to be Mike Tyson. I want to people like Bill want to be Muhammad Ali. You know, what there's one of them. There's one of you so you be that you be good at your you be good. You be a good you if your name's Jim you be a good gym. Yeah, you be a good Jack you're not I mean, don't me don't try to be Mike Tyson? Yes, we can always learn off almost  The moment from that even just when I first started I watch Boxing concert. Yeah, and I just adapted little things from every once every from stars that I liked and even stars and maybe I didn't find entertaining but they were good at what they did. Yeah, I would take from that and had its my own game. Yeah, which I'd probably give that advice as well as watching much content on your own but boxing. Yeah as you can and not just not just professionals like if that's what you like, but it is still a matured watching amateur boxing.  Constantly as well. Yeah, there's some good averages that you get good entertainment from the market. You look at the Cuban say that Stephens recently. They really got haven't even the Stars like yeah you adapt so you might some fights you might get away and fighting like a cube at all. Yeah, but then you might need it like a Ukrainian or European style and to help you. I'm be more active or get on the inside at mid-range more instead of just putting. Yeah, the shock humans do like you've got to be able to  Adapt in any situation you put that shot. Yeah, everyone's every different and and what exactly on you as well when you know, a lot of times people see I you you have your hands down. We know that you've broken the mold then when you start your fight, it's always perfect. Yeah, because and you try and get the momentum to swing that's what that's what the Gap is. That's what we're trying to do. But when you box in Fiji your hands didn't leave your face because yeah because he was a he was a warrior here.  Hard Punch and kid and you box into a give it a lot of people don't see those things. We didn't have any video over there or anything like that. That's what I end up putting down four times. And yeah, yes for one crayon or point three times. Okay. There's a question here. It's a tough one. I think do you have a favorite punch that you like to throw a punch that I like to throw?  Road to hurt people. Yeah, which is obviously the left rear. Yeah like a yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah and I love watching people throw that. Yeah, but doesn't me your performer pint? Yeah my favorite punch to punch like to throw and land. Yeah, probably is that long long right here along right here. If you ever watch them. You've also got Roy Jones with his lead. Yeah Ducks under. Yeah. I just think it just looks so good and I remember seeing Damien who fears the throttle unreal?  I think I think he in the Olympics he hit Marcus Brown with them found branded. The house is coming from stories. Yeah, I think for me that punch that lady right here to land and throw em what to throw and land it and then be able to like screwed off. I think that yeah, I get a little bit out of that. Yeah, but if every shot I love the left but let's not forget to the body. I love watching review happens through that, but I don't know me better than that guy.  It's not on me. I'm happy for you. Mr. Rawat, I think but I've only started really watching that since I've probably been about seven eight. Yeah. Yeah and ever since I watched it and thrown it. Yeah, I don't think there's a better punch lot to took. Yeah and hearing that  For example, that's a little bit of confidence a lot of time. You get it again, you get it again six rounds, but when you're when you're in an amateur fight, it's a lot faster. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, and I'm probably guilty of that as well. I'd rather just stay longer pick. Yeah punches winning the fight then get in there and get my head clear. That's what that's why that's why the amateur boxing.  Different game in the pro boxing it's a Sprint. You got to take your points out. You got to do your job where I think a lot of young amateurs watch a lot of Pros, but they need to watch amateurs as well class it like you just said before you need to watch top-class amateurs because the game is different. Yeah, and I like for me.  Why I struggle to watch amateur boxing as much as I was surprised because I love watching the lights camera action. That's exactly what is it and you can too. I love the little things like this the ring War you you're okay. Yeah. Yeah. That's right. That's all whether you like or not have any mundane build a career on people not liking him. Yeah, it's here.  You made it to the show the show that people get dragged into. Yeah, and that's the thing. I love watching that but I know myself that's not me. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah for sure. I do like so another good question. I thought from somebody sent through what life lessons are what is boxing taught you about who you are what you know your life lessons in boxing a thing.  Confidence hmm. Just having come from the confidence and relentlessness to do things. Yeah, and not be scared of what might happen after or and just backing my own ability to do things. Well, I think when I started boxing even through school like you just be sitting in class and you know, something like I'll go your way and I just I know in my own ability I can  Smart enough to do things, you know, I'd like my grades picked up as soon as I started boxing and I was at the gym more than I was and school. Yeah pretty much but my grades picked up because I wanted to do it so bad and I remember here I got really sick and I'm so glad he loves this boxing because he's got a piggy school grades up or he's not coming and then, you know, I'll sit there for half an hour watch Boxing when I got home from training and then after that I'm sitting down and doing homework, and I don't got better.  - confidence and resilience. Yeah as well like how many times up he made of times I've had, you know things don't go my way in there any more decisions don't go away and you just you just have to push on him. Yeah, and I think resilience with massive even like you might not get the job you want I suppose you've answered a few of these questions here like all E1. Like there's another question after losses. Why'd you stick to boxing? And why do you think  It's worth it world. It's because the big goal is so much bigger and you know what you're chasing a loss is a speed bump. It's fucking terrible at times or and as not stopping you from where you going is it, you know, it's not going to stop you and the losses like although they might see the weight of the world to me. There's people going through bigger battles and me and I think you've got to look at that. Sometimes like appreciate this is this has happened but I've got to use this and I really pushed myself forward and  And keep going. Yeah, for sure. I think in the long run like if there's this likewise boxing worth it is one of those questions there and I think it's worth it in the long run for me because I know like an amateur game. I know things might not go away but I just got to keep pushing on. Yeah, because I know in the pros I will be able to make the dough for myself and I will be able to do what I want to do and I just think for me that's just inevitable. That's just going to happen once being  This is what happens is we have just left doing your kind of shit. Yeah, if I fuck up along the way but you know, you're gonna get your apprenticeship and you're going to give a try to you know, it's gonna happen for you know, like obviously want to make money and do things with boxing outside of just getting belts. And yeah, that's right. I want to make money as to kill myself and not sure my family, but that's how you got to set those big goals. You know me a reason, you know reason is because you want to be the world champion, but you  I want to have everybody else's dream. You want your dream of I'm going to do something with it. I'm going to you know, whatever you can do with the name that you build yourself and scratch, you know, it's like recycling communities, you know, come out of box it like boxing sort you so many lessons. How many male is he and just to be relent like resilient with your own business. I don't doubt. This has been a smooth run running your own gelfling off and coming up with ideas. That might go against the grain at times. That's right. You just got to do it. You have to think outside the box.  And be prepared everyone's gonna have an opinion on something because he's gonna kill you on the event will get scared with that nowadays. Don't they like yeah hundred percent, especially with social media. Everyone's happy to say shit on social media, but you know what, you just gotta that's their opinion or wouldn't even hear it if there was no social media, so it doesn't really matter. Yeah, and then the date they're following you. Yeah, that's right. If you don't like it, it's pretty easy just to leave it. You know - yeah. Yeah.  Yeah, so, okay. So what's a week once a week for you? What's a general weekend as far as you try to do we look like so we're trying to three times a day for a 6/6 up six days a week. Yeah that'll include strength training. So strength and conditioning is done at the community actually to two sessions. They're in good hands down there. So  To strengthen Khan, and then I do about three three full like running sessions. Yeah, that'll either be a long distance may not too long at this stage because we're coming into States probably be about what you do. You think they got a case tops when it's pretty cruisy. Just keep the weight down on it. And then you have you just Pacific you're running specific sessions with on the track, which can be short or long.  Hundreds of 405 comes gets closer and I feel fit we shorten the distance has up. And so yesterday we when we do yesterday, I hate 685 had 600 years ago and then you obviously you give us the X and here it's going to head up and the rest period shortens a little bit each week. So yeah, it's always fun. That's probably the worst session for that. I think at the moment usual six boxing sessions. Yeah.  We do to add special to and then was a bit more extra sessions with the group sparring sessions in there. I'm fine pretty regularly. So I think expiring will be there but I don't think it's a massive concerned. I think more the partner working partner were killing it feels up. That's right.  The strength of otherwise found it's a hard thing for me to do. Yeah, but to get that motivation to go but you just have to do it as part of the pilot process and same with track tracks the same lie. I've never really enjoyed track but on yesterday. We saw some kids aren't there first time didn't we and you know, I remember when I first saw that you were exactly like those kids yesterday like but you actually hop on that you just couldn't find that cruise control as well. You got to know your own body and  How to make the font remember we did attract station there with think it was over and there's a few other boys there Heidi Murphy most not all over the bad haul was just bad holes an Olympian. It used to trying it out Jim Commonwealth Games representative as well. But we one of the people I looked up to when we're was boxing and when he was boxing and he said to me watch me hit I think we did eight hundred and we did six eight hundreds and we had to hit one.  30 laps and you had to hit three minutes and he goes Watch Me Hit the time every time as I had seen. Oh, he's gonna hit the time but he just done it that many times and he knew the pace and how did he wasn't fit at the time but he just knew and and yep shit, you're not every time it was three minutes three minutes. Even on the doctor. I'm probably the last year and a half two years. I've learned how to just know the pace and don't know when to push and when I went to rest and that's a go.  Cease firing as well. Yeah, it's okay. I might be able to I might be able to work in close here. Then when I come out I can maybe walk around the ring and just little things that those things are picked up from those experience boys like that horror and carry home was just there ring generalship and there yeah and their ability to train but not overdo it. Yeah, just do what's do what's necessary I suppose. Yeah. I suppose the last question that we will finish off with.  Your biggest inspiration who what's who's a role model to you within like boxing itself? Stylistically always loved Amy Hooper or watched him. Yeah, and he was in our gym as well. So I got to watch him train and Spa. He was always a massive influence in a gym, but then there's also boys like like I've mentioned Brad for Kerri ho yeah Cameron having this here for as well Patty Murphy.  Rowan your own bed off your other than some spine with round and round groans help me along the way but in life life, obviously Mom and Dad yeah. Yeah, they've helped their work ethic and the way they go about things is really helps me puts me in good stead to know that like some of the things that I do I couldn't do it. I couldn't even work a job. Jonno gets up and Dad. Yeah, right. We'll get up at four o'clock in the morning.  He won't finish the day till 5:00 at night and then he'll come drive the boxing come and watch me try and and then come home because and he gets home by 9 o'clock at night. And these rally girls chase dogs for three days. Yeah and mums the same mum will get up do everything like for me and my sister and she's just a great person as well. I think you're wise be grounded. I hope they wouldn't let that one eye you fake come off the ground thinking. It's so fucking lucky back down pretty quick.  I started I can imagine but your mom and dad massive Inspirations of just the way they go about things that are so selfless. Yeah, they put at everyone else before themselves. Nice month Mom, especially month an angel but and my sister obviously as well. Yeah. This is a massive inspiration like to see it the situation she's been in and the battle she sat down overcoming her own wife chance to explain.  A little bit about that or what you would like leave it a little bit but it's just battled her whole life and she struggled the way she goes about things is she's just like with just such a resilient character. Yeah, and if I could be half the person she is yeah, I'd be in good stead to be good like a good good role model for younger kids and she it's just the way she goes about everything like she might get faced with something like especially when she was younger. Yeah and like, you know her know her strong.  As well so it before come games. She had a situation pop-up and and without a blink of an eye. She's like, all right, we'll just deal with it. That's my mom instead. I'd rather people that are normally inside. Yeah, and she was just like, okay Steve what's know just like that's just her attitude about everything in life. And I think I've taken that and transfer that into my boxing. We're obviously Olympics didn't come for it world champion says one of championships hasn't happened for me before. Yeah Commonwealth Games mr. App and you  Just look at her situation. You're like like like if I can't get over there. Just can I put it on life - that's right. Yeah, my buddy works. Yeah. What what's to say? I can't just get over this and it should just be able to ride with it. Yeah, she's training itself. Now she's doing excellent. She's training down here reckons. She's the best boxer in the family shit. That's a g. And then again, your mom says that to the  Those three of my biggest Inspirations as as far as nice outside of boxing. Yeah, I can transfer that into my boxing as well and then obviously people are mentioned an office helped along the way yourself Shara. It's like a family down here. So it's just you guys inspire me every day to come and be a better person and and of as you said just kept me grounded, you're not hot so you don't let me go big head or not. That is anything we get a big head about but you know, like some people have a few fights that they think  Yeah, after five flights. I thought I was yeah, I didn't think I was that good actually because I was always about but like I wonder if he flies in your Bait A couple boys in your car. I'm not too bad and then you think it didn't get chucked in with Hooper and you like maybe look like yeah, we haven't even scratched the surface. Maybe I need to learn a bit more about you and share of changed my life being down here. So now I appreciate you guys having me riots its axon lat. Oh, right.  I think that's excellent. I think we've whether we've directly or indirectly answered all those questions of people through I think everyone should be pretty happy with that. And that was great. Jackass. So under the under the big year now, we've got you got it you can are fewer games. You got state championships who got a strange championships with oil championships. It's pretty big year the Year coming up.  I feel good for I feel confident you boxing really well at the moment. The people have seen your locally and quite a lot of people from you know, Interstate are actually saying you you know, you're going well at the moment so look like we said we just keep your feet on the ground as as they have to be. Anyway. Otherwise, there's the door. Okay, you know, so doors always open. That's right. So Mike thanks for that today often people get a lot of a lot of knowledge out of that especially a lot of young people or people that have been  unsure if they're boxing there in that middle ground at the moment might be struggling with a bit of mental preparation or whatever. It might be. I think overall I think one a message you've said is you know, what doesn't matter what happens decide you just keep going. So please don't just being resilient with it. That's not going to be able to there's going to be setbacks along the way but you just got to keep pushing forward and I just been confident Relentless with your own.  With put yourself out there and believe in yourself. Do I know you're not going to love every single training session I can I could name it at five this week. But but you know, what if you desperately want that big gig, it's like it's not I say the kids are attention all the time. Yeah fucking rocket science how to be successful. You've just got to work harder than everybody else to work on. Yeah. It's it's like you said on the track the other day have how many of those boys were struggling and a couple of the girls are struggling as well?  Well, I was I wasn't struggling because I've worked so long and I just I hate it when people say oh but yeah, he's a good runner. Why is he good runner because he fucking runs that's it.

We know what the dream was fuck the audio. Okay is not doing  This for them last Tuesday in the morning Mac got a message at fucking 10:30 from the people that I do the pantomime with that said. Hey, have you heard from Aid? Oh, yeah. Yeah, they message which I guess is not important. Exactly. Yeah. Hey, it's from Aidan. Oh, no, I thought they were offering me a job. That's that's how I remember thinking when I got the message because it wasn't have you seen Aiden because it made me think. Oh, I might be getting a job. It was the show starts at 10:30 and Matt got the message out about  It would have been quarter to ten. Oh, no, I didn't even get a message. I got two missed calls and they were in within 20 minutes of each other and I was like, what time were they? I thought I was thinking all that need me to come jump in like last minute. They brought by could Joe money turns out that's not the fact know the fact was Aidan had slept through his alarm buzzer and woke up at 10:44 and the show starts. Fuck. I love this story the show started at 10:30, right? So I woke up first of all, how do I know the story? I've told you what did you tell me? Well I came to this training.  How is this really important? Not at all? No, I'm sorry. Oh you noticed could you fucking just fuck off, please? Sorry. Sorry for trying to make podcast better run into both of you. Shut the fuck up. Yeah, and let me just carry this podcast. No, I just quickly want to borrow for 45 minutes into whether this is important. So I woke up at 8:30 and I looked at my life and I went oh you beauty I have to be out. I have to be up until quarter past 9:00. So I'm gonna go back to sleep but didn't set a quarter-past nine alarm. Just thought I'll wake up at quarter past nine wrong.  Wrong look up 1044 216 missed calls a bunch of messages from friends that aren't even involved in the podcast in the podcast in the pant. Oh, they're just people had reached out because they thought I'd died I call to they thought they'd call you. By the way. Once you get the 10 missed calls, he's not answering don't keep cool. Right? So I called Blake back and I'm like, oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God, and he's like are you okay? I thought you were in a car accident what's going on? And I was like I slept in I'm so sorry. I'll be there in 10 minutes wrong. I'm at  15 minutes away from the from the show if I just drove there straight away, but I had to brush my teeth Etc.  Yeah, so I get there right as they closed interval. So I missed the entirety of act one. Right? All of act one is pretty much just how I meet the Beast because I'm the dad and Bell has to go after because being the best they missed it. So they did me as a puppet and it was fucking terrible. Oh, yeah, and it is a bit where it's like me and the Beast but instead of doing that because they couldn't really do it. They closed the curtain and Blake the guy that's in charge said well, you know and bikes and Belle's father went off to find the Beast this  It is so terrifying that week work can't show you also one of our actors did not rock up this morning. So we can't show you that either. Oh, well I get there. Oh my God. I'm so sorry. Oh my fucking God. I'm so sorry. He has now, it's alright, it's alright. We're just glad you're okay. No big deal. No big deal, you know roast me a bit but fair enough. I was like then he goes. Oh, by the way, just before the ACT. You're going to come out and speak to the audience. So CNN a come out with me when I speak to doughnuts. So we go out and there's fucking hundred people sitting there.  And like I said, hello everyone, this is Aidan. This is Aidan. Yeah, if all named me, yeah and shamed name to change the goes there. Yeah. He was late Aiden spent $700 on an Apple Watch that fail to wake him up this morning. So don't that's why you should never you know and trust the machines don't don't trust don't ever buy into consumerism or of the fuck. He said hey guys. Also, we're doing a pantomime of Robin Hood on the weekend, but everyone.  Yeah, we'll get half-price tickets with the promo code. Aiden was late. Hey guys. All right, go to the show.

But anyway,  It was like, you know, what fuck you fuck you fuck this only like tomorrow as well. I'm gonna sit in the car park tomorrow. So that's my story of how I was fucking light to a show this paying me too much money to be there. Imagine if you went to see it a professional show in Melbourne, and then the actor wasn't there and then you went into the void of meet them and they were like, fuck you Geoffrey Rush. She didn't dick. Well. Yeah, but also know that fucking little fucking kids show start at stupid o'clock if this gives you any any Joy  I can guarantee you the majority of people are use that promo code a spelling your name wrong and not getting smooth transition speaking of gripping content.

Thank you. David Barton with kick bam. Aah when you send that message, did you think we would read aloud on the podcast and then we would use it as a segue into that had rain the wall. That was a point. You're a fucking genius. That is unreal.  For those on the different because I sent all the other creatures probably in the right last thing is like, oh, I'll put that in that's how we can get out of there. That's a very funny. That's some good thinking that's thinking ahead. Let's take it ahead. I was it as you know, I work at JB Hi-Fi JB Hi-Fi you've done it again and I was thinking the other day we were having a bit of fun and games at work if you were stuck in a JB Hi-Fi  What weapon would you if you were getting attacked you had to pick up one thing? You can't modify the thing in any way you can't take a bit of the thing. What is something that a JB Hi-Fi cells that you would use as a weapon. Now when you say modify can I modify like if there's a modifiable? For example, you can't pick up a Dyson and only use the pole you have to use the entire thing. But if Apple can be removed, can I do that? Like, I'm not. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay sure. I would get like one of the mic stands and just take the solid bit of metal out of it, but you take  Metal rod. Yeah, I think that's a solid weapon. What do you recommend porn fridge? Yeah. Yeah. It's distracting with the porn then push the fridge on them old smells like come on. It smells like called. Come on. It smells like crazy cold come. Well, it smells like crispy cold crazy come more smells like crazy Clark's Chris be cold. Come like my client clay crazy Clark's crispy.  A cold cow the name of my client crispy Clark Garf my God, I reckon I was thinking originally I thought a Dyson pole. That's what I thought because it's just a piece of aluminum and aluminum aluminum, but I did then was brought to the attention of a just a massive copper wire because you have like AV cables are made of copper. Mmm get into spin it this whack people in the head whenever the best one. No because I don't think I don't think I  Could handle that as efficiently as I could handle us. And also can you really stop someone with it? Because once you whip, the ones that are like an extension cord around the ankle or something you have it but then once you're within range once you get past the tip of it, yeah, then you just like it's just something to choke you with. I guess like I'm sure numchucks are a better weapon than a stick but in my hand Chi is useless totally useless the same way I think swinging a bit of wire like that takes it that's like it's like it takes a bit of aiming a bit of red.  Them you stand out of range until the shoulder gets tired. Yeah, I love the American viewers probably buy guns. It's an electronic store isn't and I don't have any type of gun right next to the Vodka. Do you sell toys has no no guy came in and wanted a police scanner so I can work at her Polito which people are whatever I can so you can put a top on it and then just print out some copies.  Speaking of Americans buy copies because we because Kanye and scanner. You just scanning. Yeah. I thought you were sending yeah was like it was like sort of like a double layer joke like a an onion before I forget the none cake we can come back to the to the poor choice, please. No, but I don't want a fucking forget this the girl that we've spoken about this girl in Breyer was set a name who the one who did ya respond to my message when I graduated, uh, and who it was the vibrational existence as a bit of a wanker on Facebook. I just learned something.  Better the other day looking at a story because I check a story all the time. It's endless content. What do you know? Sometimes she talks in an American accent? I'm not surprised fucking disgusting. Honestly. I'm not fucking surprised when I heard that's yuck bright. It's happened every few days now like the other one. She said she was like, I'm like, I'm Legit now, you know, like it was described live there. Sometimes it's not that she's honest. She's in a Melbourne are she's like get it. All she does is other one where she every time she's drinking something. She raised her eyebrows and she goes and hits the phone with her drink and then takes a sip it goes.  And does this fuck I'm going to show you a fucking dumbass God. She makes me mad anyway, she uh, so she's put this one. He's like, hey guys going to the gym today. Can't wait to go to the gym. I can't do it. I said New Zealand accent not that Janet whatever. All right kind of the gym and then she gets back. I'm just like I just want to respond to the people who are criticizing that I was sweating so much at the gym and it's not like she's playing a character. She's just doing an American accent and she's like I work hard. Okay, I work hard and I sweat. I'm not like usual girls next one first.  Who the fuck was commenting on how much he sweat? So she just wanted to say something and she and she comes in and out of that all the time and it's like can you just comment on every time she posts on just go? No one cares this end? No one cares. No one cares. Hey guys, it's only you know, no one cares. Hey guys, it's me Miranda. She fucking respond to that. Yeah, you guys just wanted to say to all the people who say no one cares if people actually do care. This is my journey May Journey Through the vibrational existence that we call.  Planet Earth. Okay, because one of those stories on the stream and I nearly vomited I was like look, why is she doing this? It's fucking it's horrendous. It is a horrendous person. She switched out of an accent Tink. It's like people go overseas for 2 weeks and come back with an accent and they're like, yeah, it's just shut onion wanker and you stain on the earth fucking cunt like a piece of shit smooth transition and Afraid you came back. He was in England for like a year and I take a guess. It wasn't I wasn't carbon because carbon Airways like little hats and stuff.  I had a friend a little hat back in the day. It was just like flat cap like a paperboy hat. Yeah, like a big key finder be like Cockney or something. And I think you fucking blind be assumed to go that in the UK and he came back and he had an accent. He's like, oh, how's it going? We always went no one's buying it. What are you fucking doing?

All right, and I'd go and I'd come back and I'd see back down and I'd stop and I don't swim and go with her for a little bit and then I go and do some more laps and at one point she was going to come down to a light but as a hundred meter pool and so she just stops. It's like I'm not doing another light. I need a bit more of a break before I try that again. She swims back and then the life of God comes up to us and says guys if you're going to be stopping while you're in the lanes you'll be blocking people's and we don't allow that so you'll need to move to the multi-purpose Lane.  What and I was like I understand it says on the board right there. There's a list of rules do not stop in the lanes. But we are the only two people apart from the other guy in the fast lane who are actually using swimming Lanes. Does it fucking matter? Yeah, and then she went away and I was just boiling a back was like you should calm down like you're being a bit over the top and I'm like, are you fucking serious? That's insane. I'm like, how small is your fucking your your your power in this world in your life that you have to come here and fuck until  Two strangers that they can't stop in the middle and I get that it's the rules but does it fucking matter but you fucking dick away. Did I ever react nah, I don't know why he was still angry. I got your point across the said do you actually say? Oh, no, I didn't say you said that though. No. No, that's he didn't say I didn't say anything to her back woman. Yeah, that's why you were so angry because you didn't get it reacted. If I'd said, yes. Okay. No. No, I didn't I didn't say anything. I said, I'm sorry and then we moved on and I was like, wait, why are we why?  Need to do that and it came to me bit late and then I was mad and I didn't get a chance to say anything. She kept walking up and down the pool and I was like before just to touch on our conversation earlier about 20 minutes ago. You said for us to not stop it. I just want to touch on that again that we're actually the only find me waiting for a really good swimmer. I'm stopping because I want to stop my girlfriend's in the next line if I want something I'm gonna fucking stop. All right. I'll drown you anyway.  Not 50 so you minute also it's kind of shit was back stopping because she was exhausted. Yeah, then fuck off. I'm not stopping to have a fucking cup of tea. Yeah fucking piece of shit. I'm physically exhausted. Oh, thank you. Thank you. I'm glad this first segment of did I react when well, yeah. I mean you you definitely have it for too long. Yeah. Well, that's just like, yeah you did huh either say something or just let it go. You can't just you can't no don't tell me that that's possible, but that if you don't know if you don't get it.  You can't just go. Well, I didn't get it out. It's true. You've got to accept the fact that you didn't get it. That is because you're choosing right now not to get it out. I didn't think of it. So yeah, but then you thought of it and then you held on to it. Either go. Okay, you know, I'm not going to do anything with this idea. So I'm going to let it go or you go I'm gonna flag her down have a couple quick words, or you can spill coffee Levi.

I'm like fuck she's coming with me and she gets to meet like this close to my face like Grime offenses. Yes. Well, I think what says we're going to be together and I was like how so and she went I had a dream last night that if I didn't get together with you I was going to murder you and I'm like, are you going to murder me sick now? I'm not going to murder you but that that's that means that we have to be together. Sometimes people have dreams and I was  Like that's weird. That's a girl who doesn't know how to manipulate quite right yet besides like maybe we date. Maybe you get hit by a car. If you say no who's to say what the result of this conversation will be. Anyways, also, she is wearing a massive leather jacket. Yeah. It's like back Blackshear two guys behind a crunching and maybe you happily date me now. Maybe you date me miserably in a wheelchair. I don't know yet. Anyways, I'll see you at home neck. So that was that was something that I  Yeah, that's terrifying. Is that genuinely scary? Yeah, and then later on we were on I am I'm sure it's all this in one of the podcast with you. But one time we had a birthday party for the guy who suck the drink at the carpet all these links call.

We went and we went mother of the the mother said come with me and then we went for we're all you know, what I find takes my mind of having a fight digging my own grave quickly anyway, well,  She takes me and takes me to one of the roughly behind the bushes one of the rooms one of the scat rooms and she says just come in here and talk to me and I was like, I'm drunk on my own K. Shuts the door behind me and locked me in there and she left me in there all night and I was banging on the door. She locked you in a room lock me in there without my phone with our food without anything to left me in there and and I couldn't get out and so I eventually just went to sleep because I'm like it got to the point where I'd been about four hours and I went This Woman's kidnapped me and I'm like, I am feeling  unsafe by the fact that you're not gonna kill me because she's a mother Mike. I'm not gonna be in here for the rest of my life. I'm not going to die in here and the fact of the repercussions that would come on her from this event warmed me and I went fine. I'll go to sleep and we'll see how the next two months after you can't have it. How are they well wake up in the morning and I didn't say anything to her. They let me out and then I went home and I went up to my mum and I say said to her, you know what it obviously did something to my brain because I said I went up very come here.  Mom something happened. It's not just personal. Yeah, burst into tears. I was like what is going on Mike?

Yeah way to go to meetings and have to keep me and the daughter and different classes and and the mother was all there.  I wasn't allowed to come to wasn't allowed to be on the council at the school anymore. All that kind of stuff fucking good that woman insane anyway, so her daughter wanted to kill me today me. What if I roll GMAT podcast really fun fucking wow. Yeah. Yeah. So was this the one who your mom let the dog ate the cake. Yeah. Yep. Why did you family's ever get along? Is this the same girl that Bruce dumped polystyrene and glitter on? Yep. Fuck a why did she stay near you? It was like one of those weird  things we know when you're in a small town and you are friend. You're like I hate this purpose is not the people but yeah exactly but they're in your friend group and it's just kind of how it goes. They're all the same height. So your friends. This is no other people living in the are lagly and Mum never liked her mom because their mom was on the council the school and was always like it was like that. So Matt's mom. I think the school funding should go to big at toilets to lock boys into she be like I'm we need some parents to to volunteer at the thing. Well that turtle looks like Matt's mom hasn't done very much at all for the schools.  Maybe Chic like it was like that kind of mum when she judge other people in a partying. Yeah, like also you just working for a fucking school in the middle of merope. I mean, you don't have a job. You know. My mom is a full-time job. What do you know? Don't fucking work the campaign get the fuck out of here. She did work at the candy. Of course she did so nothing else going on. She's like, I just want to be at school all the time if she was a worse I hated her. I had a turkey. Oh, she's quite capable. She sounds yeah. What's this Killer story? When done well, sorry Killer story, but I was explaining to bed.  The other day that there's a girl at work. I won't say her name because I don't said that he said her name is chow mein and she had it. She was where she was kind of cool. She's like an edge law. Not an angel. What's the one where they wear like giant shoes and baggage and she's a pipe Beast child and a white adults client base. It's a type. It's like a fashion style like a billy eilish the clothes. She wears like hypebeast clothes. Is that a thing? Yeah. Yeah, Victor. I'm so honestly, I mean, I'm a 24 year old human being but I am like 89 years old. I got didn't I don't really  Still know what an edge Lord is. I felt like that when I watched Tick-Tock compilations other day, I went these are these aren't funny. Yeah, like these they like I see they're kind of like Vine but I'm like these are in it. These are nowhere near as funny as line, but kids obviously find them really really funny. I'm like so many people it too many people not even just kids so many people like desperately want to be Tick Tock fast. I know I'm out of touch what I'm watching that I'm like this sucks. This isn't humor. You know, what's good Seinfeld. That was a good check. Yeah anyways, so she dresses like hot base and so  so but she's got to wear a uniform like everyone else and so she had this shirt that's like three sides was probably the same size as my shirt. She's wearing these tiny skinny and goes down. Well I can ease and so I went up to her and she's young. She's like 17 or something and I went to never bigger size do I would just funny it's funny and she went I'm allowed to wear whatever I want actually and I was like, oh, okay. Sorry. I was I was just jokin. She's like anyways, so then the other night I was in charge of the store and she was in and another person was in and I saw these guys come in that were dressed like fuck it.  Alright, here we go. Go on one of them is black which is what's it's a, you know, it's important to the story. Well, they're just what was the give us a call? You know, they got that they were in a hoodie and a cap and they're wearing all black and they've got the the added ass bag and chains and they've been they've got a really good people they got a speaker on them and they're playing music in that and so I went these guys are going to steal something because it's always the guys who dress like fuckheads at steal something and so I was watching them on the camera and then there was like a service thing to come down. So I had to leave and then I kind of followed them around.  The store and then I went to her and she noticed I was doing so what are you doing this? I'm watching these guys because I reckon they got to steal something her friends. God Matt. They're obviously her friend and she went and she had a big garments like, you know, it's profiling right? I was like what it's like you're profiling them based on the way. They look and you assume they're going to steal something and I was like, I was like, well it kind of yeah, but I might animate and she's like no it's interesting. I'm like, I'm going to see you know, I'm not picking that dude because he's black I'm picking him because he dressed like a fuckhead. I'm like that's  Nothing to do with it and she's like Mom what have you say? I'm going. Okay anyways, so then if you seems like a pain in the ass and if you suspect someone is going to steal something. You've got to know it in that kind of thing and I was like, so I get a text this morning to fuck it stole a headphones like fuck you as a exactly yeah fucking my profiling came in at work. Yeah, Didn't I was so annoyed that she was like, you're probably I'm like, yeah, I am profiling but a profiling of based on how they dress not based on the case of the what what they're doing or they are yeah or And the fact I play music all that sort of stuff so it felt so good.  Good to be right. I can't express to you. We got a guy at JB Hi-Fi Cruise casual that got fired the day. It's two days before Christmas government told the story. He is such a fuck. He has his hair like imagine you just take he's got long as here, but he just spikes it all up but it's like it's not Super Saiyan. Oh, yes. He's we used to call him Sonic. The Hedgehog douche bag. Looks like Sonic the Hedgehog. That's really employment Sonic. I really like that. He he would wear like upside.  Down crosses on his ears and likes it in one little desk. Like there's like deaths around the place and he'd sit there just sipping a mother for his whole shift never do anything to sort of sit around and fucking I hate him so fucking much as Sonic fucking little dumb idiot helped his friends steel $400 headphones because they were locked up with security key, but he accidentally left his security key right on the desk and then walked away as his buddies, which we knew his buddies because he was talking to them and it like  Yeah fucking yeah, I'm a fucking little granny fucking toilets piece of shit. He's friends stole headphones and they were caught before they left. As I said earlier. I said to my boss like those two people steal something not knowing that Sonic and helped. So my big rust firing manager walked up. He's like empty Pockets like we don't want to empty your fucking Pockets to $400 tiny head phones in their pockets bag, whatever it was by the way, I get it there were in their pockets.

spotify:episode:6qZvSdtBbYFVpsPWcy9rCg	 Let's take a deep breath in and let me breath out.  I'm just quiet mind a little bit.  Even though for me right now, it's not that easy because I'm really really excited and really grateful for an email that I received yesterday in the episode celebrating 1 million downloads. I mentioned the opportunity for you with gratitude Seekers to share your gratitude for someone special publicly with my help and with the help of the podcast platform, but what I received yesterday by email surpassed my  Every expectation it was an email from a fellow gratitude Seeker that has been listening to the podcast since 2017. Her name is Northern Mullen and she's a musician that has been touring the world playing the flute for the past 16 years with the famous British rock band The Moody Blues.

And again, I thank you so much for that. I'm sending this email because of the appreciation. I feel for the work you're doing thank you for making the world a better place and please continue being awesome.  But another part of the email has to do with that section that I talked about in the beginning. She goes on to say I was pulled towards your gratitude podcast. Like I said a couple of years ago and then after hearing so many of your podcasts on gratitude, I realized that the first song on my first solo album, which I released in 2014 was a song written to and for my father.  Who is dying of Alzheimer's at the time? It's a song called this beautiful world and it's about my gratitude towards him for teaching me about how wonderful life is. I wrote and played everything that you hear in this song nor does first intention was to send it as a token of appreciation for me for the podcast, but after listening to it, I knew that I must  I share it with you the Gratitude Seekers It's A Beautiful song written and recorded by a fellow gratitude speaker that can really help you connect with this wonderful feeling of gratitude.

spotify:episode:1ijPkI7v1kiWgmWrXFjlNU	Justin Timberlake can do things to me. Hey guys, welcome to the first ever episode of VIP pass. I'm one of your hosts Brandon's joined as always by Jesse. Hello, Jessie. How you doing today? I'm good. How are you? Yeah, I'm good. I am living it up with an adopted living the dream and making a podcast with your bod. Yeah, that is the best but shout out to best friends. Oh, yeah.  Anyway, CIP pass and informed insight into all the news you didn't ask for we cannot look at Entertainment News anything interesting. Mainly this first podcast going to be a lot about music because we both love music who doesn't like music. If you don't love music you can get out of my podcast. Yes, pretty much. It's a good thing. There's only two of us in this tiny room with a little mixer. It's not that tiny of a room, but it's pretty big what are sitting pretty close together because you know, do we just tuberose and we are okay being close to each other because that's okay, you know.  It can be friends and close to each other and it's not a problem. Also, a headphone chords really restricted fund called the really short so we're gonna cuddle up with her, right? Hmm. So let's jump into our first bit of news for today a rapper flexes about his money and credit card fraud and gets arrested for it. Brendan the goes pretty much I saw this just scrolling through Facebook the other there had a bit of a laugh because these rappers are all about flex and what they go up. This guy's name self-made cash with a K mind you  You like the Kardashians? Yeah, except the Kardashians don't get arrested for credit card fraud. No, they just make sex tapes and make millions. Hmm. That's the way to go guys. That's a dream has yeah, so he bragged about committing credit card board in all of this tracks and then he got arrested by the police for it his 25 year old guy real name Jonathan Woods, he's always got hit with a number of charges actually wire fraud aggravated identity theft what's aggravated identity theft. Um, I don't know but I feel like it's pretty  Right forward like he took someone's identity forcefully like he was aggravated. He was angry, you know angry took it because like identity theft like usually it's just people don't identity theft isn't a joke Jim. Is that a reference to something office reference because I can catch office. Yeah, you you need a listen. No, you know watch the office the office is a quality shot. And if you don't watch it, you're missing out anyone listening to this go and watch the office if you haven't already quality.  Show the US version not the UK. Sorry we could do it is super. Oh, you can't beat Steve Carell it Corral is a dream. Yeah. I've actually had to listen to his music before we start this podcast. Just get an idea of what kind of  Artists were dealing with here. If we can call on that you can call him an honest. I think you can call anyone at all. This doesn't mean they're like doesn't mean that Arts quality is my God. They may call it doesn't excuse it was all right, like it's just kind of like a standard Urban beats. Not the best voice not the best lyrics it's lyrics is what got him bad actually. Yeah, because what do we have a quote? We have what he said or is it just a general if he was like, I cannot look he said I got them.  My feelings of these swaps. I made a Killin I made 10 and have to split it and then he's got a bunch your Instagram posts of all his money bunch of credit cards got like a fake gold credit card chain, and here it says Woods claim to be sophisticated at credit card fraud when in fact his not this is a federal prosecutors statement released only days ago.  Yeah, so he was frequently posting stuff on Twitter and Instagram containing large amounts of money his credit cards and he was he's pretty much trying to promote credit card for which is I think it's like a death wish to be honest. Yeah, if you're gonna promote something illegal just in general don't do the thing. Oh, I mean, I mean, okay do the thing don't promote the thing first up don't it? Legal things are bad. They're illegal for a reason. Don't break the law. But if you're going to do something bad  Don't promote it and if you promote something as a meme don't then do it is asking for trouble. I feel so he could have like this could have been is like stick his giving you could have had like YouTube videos with him like fake gold credit card just like flipping them in the air and whatnot. But to actually that going to try and do this and then call out about it. That's like the bubbled it's a bold move. This feels like a world star hiphop kind of move. Yeah. This is definitely a world star feeling like it's almost not real. Yo shout-out to was solve for having some of the  Funniest artists in the rap game. That is well start man, you know like day long neck and wide neck. Yeah that that's like the power of memes. They assigned was I have of em, I've got at least two maybe three songs out that that pretty Kickin that's crazy though because widen it got arrested and his mug shot went viral because he had a really wide neck and then they were like, oh this kid has a really long neck or whatever and then somehow they hooked.  Been like they met each other that's on to Worldstar. Yeah, he's not still prosecuted though, because I saw a video of the underworld egg. Yeah massive it was recognized. Did you participate? I don't think I did I did I like the egg on part of world history. I don't think I like the message of the egg will get to that in a sec. But they had through a massive party for the world egg like all the FaZe Clan was there for some reason and so it was daddy long and winding they were both at the like celebrating Egg party. It's me agree to just call them long like and widening.  That Daddy pot makes me so uncomfortable that he should make you uncomfortable. He gets his neck licked all the time. That's like his thing. What hang on what have you not seen the no explain this to me. What did he want in like the video then like wrapping and stuff and he's there. He's like, I'm pretty sure he says like the like the lyrics like lick my long neck and like there's a video of like girl licking his long neck and wide neck just there in the background like chilling this so much worse. That wide next is watching him. You just show this kind of like that. He's just like his bodyguard lion.  Names daddy wide neck like a and daddy long. No. No, I was Daddy's long neck and wide neck or I'm pretty sure it's just daddy long night. And then why neck and I want ice is what Nick? Yeah, as far as I'm concerned in terms of the boys the boys the next. Yeah, it's Daddy Long Neck and wide neck and their songs are next up next up. Oh my god. Let's go out with me. And then the other one is next big thing. Okay, so they're just they're still a meme. They're not there.  I just playing into the meme no, eight point eight million views and 4.4 million views. No way. They have 8 million views almost 9:00 last night. The thumbnail is literally a girl looking this kids long neck that that's like crazy the amount of things people get famous famous off because this self-made cash the fraud credit card for guy had about like 2,000 likes Max on Instagram and now he's famous because he did the dumb and then you got is that the thing is he gone?  Like if he doesn't get prosecutor if he does and he goes to jail with her if he gets released you see then gonna blow up. Is he going to become big or well some good primer for you? Because like is it? Is it all a strategy did he do it on purpose? So he was like, you know what I'm gonna do all this stuff and then it gets him that meteor exposure. No publicity is bad publicity. It's yeah, I feel so with rap music, especially it's all about the promotion the publicity. These wild wild things that you have to do to try and like getting  the name out there because music is very very saturated industry and there's a lot of music out there anyone can be a musician anyone can be a musician proof proof of concept. We've got three interesting Rapids here. You got YouTubers doing a lot of music now that branching out some YouTubers have some solid music. What time do you leave joke songs and stuff, but there are some Youtubers with legit songs out there that are good and a good albums and stuff like Jody respect joji blew up mad the um, what was it? He was like the pink guy. Yeah, I think I  Is it filthy Frank wrote the Frank? Yeah, Frank filthy Frank wanted like the greatest internet memes of like the early 2000s now blowing up in that chat stew filthy Frank just for giving us main formats just that are never going to get old now making like you my music but like mature you my music. Yeah, like he did his thing you do the YouTube thing. It was like, yeah like this. Alright and then he beat everyone to do something else and you want to did it and he was successful at it. I think I think that's a common Trend. I would like emo and punk musicians kind of like  growing with the times. Yeah, you got it because I think everyone has to mature and if you can grow with stuff and keep going then that's like the dream, you know, yeah for sure you also you go like think about like beds like Fall Out Boy and pack of this car massive massive bands both in their own rights, they kind of started with that emo that punk music the good stuff and then as they kind of got on as Their audience grow old because back in the day Their audience was like man, like fourteen-year-old 6-14 tyke 16 year olds like that the peak age range.  And now they're kind of like massive like pop rock frontrunners both in the iron, right? So, I think that's kind of that's quite a while like pumpkiny my music at the moment very I'm not going to say dead. There's I don't think any music genres. I'm going to die fully but it's very small. It's kind of like in it's like baby stages again. Yeah, everything works a little Wayne's so like that was like the early 2000 stuff like  BMO, I think everyone was email is cool. Like everyone wants look into that Panic at the Disco came out and they were Mo gone back to like Blink-182 and stuff like massive scene and it's just progressed into other stuff and now like Mumble rap and that's really popular. I think it's like my Britney Mary rappers like the new the new big thing for like the younger generation like again that audience is kind of like the like the late teens juice world with his new album recently came out.  A couple days ago again. He's like one of the frontrunners for that kind of music. Yeah. I think that like the way music's always changing and what's popular is popular for a bit and then it's not I'd like to see like where that goes. I'm excited to see what the next big thing is whether that's soon or in like years time. What's a prediction? What do you reckon? What are you thinking? I don't know. I'd like to see like something that never has been like super mainstream come back because like pop music's always going to be pop grunge.  Ever going away but see grunge was like in the 90s and stuff like Nirvana grunge had it time 20 year cycle. What do you reckon? I reckon it could come back. No, I see I'd like to see light jazz like come into the maze just out of them know we're never going to come back as much as I love jazz music and much as I love like that kind of like 60s 50s like 40s, even Vibe. It's it's it's had its time but people come in would jumping back into the Roaring 20s next year man. No Roaring Twenties.  Yes, but like let's bring it back. Let's bring back swing music dude, electro-swing very very Niche music scene. Still kicking would like to see a niche seen blow up. I think that it'd just be nice electricity. Let's let's get electro swing into the Forefront of the 21st century going to be honest. I don't know what electro-swing sounds like, so I'm not going to advocate for that. It's like it's like swing music and just shocked a bunch of techno over-the-top Jesse that's feels like it ruined both of them.  I mean, it's a very niche market. Of course. It's yeah, never never gonna be something like as why does encompassing as pop music is that's fair. You know, what else I think pop music is the reason why it's so heavily driven is singles singles is the currency on our radio at the moment because you can't like you got to release a lot of singles to do stuff. If you just release an album you like boom here it is that's a lot of stuff and like people are going to be sending all of it and you spread  Yourself out if you release a single people going to listen first, the only new song you've got at that's all people can listen to you. That's what get to play with music long form content is really kind of not so important. It's not as desirable. Yeah back at you can do it, but you need to lead up with the singles and then the the dedicated fans are the ones that are actually going to be listening to an album or something. We had like classical music back in the old days. So long really long songs. Yeah, but but that was the only time people could listen to music.  People would pay to go and sit in a concert hall for two hours and listen to this like one song because I was all the music they ever got so it was like this big exciting thing. Like I actually get to listen to music. Wow, imagine that so now the radio a back. Hey guys for the next two hours. I'm just going to just playing Justin Bieber's new song symphony symphony. Orchestra number 11. Yeah Symphony Orchestra Symphony get that timpani Symphony, but see that's the thing like attention spans have gone way down. Like everyone was paying attention to stuff anymore. It's - fault  Not Vines fall don't bring Vine into this. Okay, seven seconds. I format it's ruined ruined everything. It would bind change the comedy theme and it's like quick stuff and that wasn't a bad thing. But it Nest on wasn't necessarily a good thing. But like if music was that long still if you still made a two hours, so that's a lot like if you are listening to an album and you it's a two-hour album, which is like crazy, but if it was and you want to listen to it all you could but if you only want to listen to 20 minutes,  Listen to a few songs and then stop like that. It's gives you Freedom, you know, hmm off the top of my head. I can think of only maybe one to album and that's like a deluxe compilation which has like a second CD. So again, it's like two separate albums combined into one. Yeah, so it's a lot that said though. When how do you listen job? Do you like do full start to finish? I have to listen to it an order. It was written or your Shuffle kind of guy. I think I think when a new album comes out if it  You see like your first time he first few times. It's earning. You should our I think that you should listen to it in the order that they've given it out in because they have got reasons. They put it in that order whether it tells a story or like this two songs that are connected and they like flow into each other whatever it is. I think that they put thought into the order that they put it in and that at least the first time while you're discovering the songs you should do that because like there's reasons. It's an emotional ride. They take you through how they've  Want you to listen to the album and that gives you like the authentic like real experience of that contained album. I think you should listen to it at least once in order don't have to be all together. You can do it over like a few days or whatever, but you should listen to it in order to really get that experience. Yeah. It's been a while since I've kind of just like sat down with an album start to finish just soaked it up in all its Glory. I just like 50 minutes just finding a time where I'm just doing nothing for 50 minutes or even seemed down doing one thing 50.  Yeah, very rare that said when I used to listen to albums when they released I would always yeah, I would go to the start to finish like do like this this and this when I first got into music probably when I was like a fair bit young like 14, I didn't really care but I'm order. Hmm. I'd also skip introductions and interludes. I used to hate them just like the idea of like a minute of just like instrumentals was disgusting to me. Well if you were like a really light music Boomer like any met for sure how old were we met  Like 11:11 and you didn't get like into music until we were like 14 or so. It was even later than that. It was probably.  15 only 16. So that's lucky attend you 11 when you really kicked in. So like it really lightly bloomed into it. So you kind of went through all the phases of what people do when they're younger like really quick where you didn't just want there was a very like very Progressive it was kind of started with like just pop music on the radio and like they're this cool. But like what else is out there got into rock as like cool. This is this is where like the real the real musics at any kind of evolved through that. It's like you very quickly evolved like you went and he was a slip.  Bracelet venue head and you just went crazy and just went through like rock to punk to emo to scream own to metal to alt metal and then all the way back up and now I'm kind of like I try to keep current on everything. I'll just keep up with what's popular and still listen to my favorite bands, but I also like to keep an ear out was what's kicking on the radio. What kind of good albums are coming out Spotify helps alot of Facebook Spotify is like a recommended stuff like if you finish a playlist and they're just put someone at think she'll like yeah, that's some good stuff.  Cool, and also they are like the discovery playlist in that for like new music. Yeah, and also the new music Friday. It's like my favorite thing getting up on like a Friday morning the new Spotify playlist for like the week is out as good that's just like new content right there just to like sit down and enjoy that said hasn't I don't think this year. There's been too many full albums that have been like excited for it's pretty early still like it's only March so like there's time to go. But yeah, I don't think there's been at least two stop that.  We would listen to 2018 2018 was a big year for busy year for music in general. Let alone like our little bits that we listened to ya even like. We'll talk about later with like the biggest songs of 2018. But yeah, 2018. What a year for me is a severe the music. Yeah, it's if you kind of have that you kind of have like your pinky and your quiet years before that probably like the last PQ is like 2050. I'm going to say yeah, I don't know man because  like stuff and it all Blends together. Well, you have like lots of like singles and songs that come at you like. Oh, yeah, this is cool. You got like a banger like song but like that like like she was just there was just hit after hit people were blowing up. We were getting new music old music a lot Yak. Like that was crazy big concert tours as well massive concert tours people would like coming together and not just turning on their own touring with other people that are like equally big also the final year of walk tool which doesn't really affect us here in Australia.  Yeah, that said that is there was like the last ever like big full cross-country warped or that's that's like the end of an era and I'm gonna end up because that was like that was more of like the emo type like so the emo the rattle a little punk bands like less than like it wasn't the big pop stuff. It was more of those Niche like less people but still so like massive huge thing that big Festival so many big names going and like last year.  That were gone. And now Bang there now what they've done. I think it's the 25th anniversary what they do. They no longer have the full cross country. They just have three shows and I don't know what states exactly. Yeah, they've got three little shows still good lineup still interesting lineups that at the moment you've got like in Australia, the only ones still kind of guys, I'd say download download music festival currently going on at the moment in Melbourne. It was on and Sydney couple days ago as well. Use those Whales big news actually even though it's covered.  We see our New South Wales then knew what do you call it, like legislations about music festivals. Yeah, all the war on music festivals going to be ridiculous. Hmm. Well, it's because New South Wales refuses to implement pill testing. Yeah. It's the Crackdown on drugs and like we're not that's not going to political or anything but it is it's getting a bit ridiculous like like all because like this all these festivals and that people doing nothing wrong getting like pulled over and patted.  Down or kicked out of somewhere like for no reason. It also makes it hard for the music festival like the people who run it because there's now like extra fees involved in getting a music festival especially in New South Wales. Yeah. It's like you can't afford I've got so much that they can like give to make their festival and if you're upping their fees and stuff, maybe they can't afford to do that now or they're gonna have to do a small Festival who knows like they're getting rid of stuff and impacting this that scene in such a major way. Probably probably the biggest music.  Swirl around where we are North Queensland is groovin the moo coming very soon actually in a couple months two months time. I think yeah, well little under two months now the on two months this year's lineup looking very interesting after what was quite for like a music fan quite a bit of a disappointing lineup last year Heard lots of complaints about it. I mean not that you lucky, you know, being driven motor have you no no, I was always keep a lookout on those as lineup. So because when you could hear it from your house, yeah. Yeah close by.  But not actually there but this year's lineup very interesting probably the one a lot of people most excited for a billy eilish. Yeah big pretty big name to be coming to like a relatively small place. Well, you got to think that's a like Twenty One Pilots as well when they won't Pilots right as they were blowing up came to groove in the groove in the moon then after that they just skyrocketed, which is a bummer because like this like really good they put on a good show. So like if  A little small, like maybe they would come back but like there's no way they're do anything like this now. Yeah, that's why you're gonna have like appreciation like smaller bands and smaller artists because when they come and do these festivals, it's like their chance like make a name and get big and really you can appreciate that's like we're like the most passionate artists. Are you see like the smaller performances in like there's a really intimate one. So yeah really gets you it's the people that are going to give their all no matter what like if you if they're doing a performance in front of a small crowd.  Like 200 or if they sell at a stadium with like a hundred thousand if they put on the same show with the same energy. Like that's a good artist. Like if you're going to commit if they commit that much and give it their all that's who deserves to be. Yeah. I think the big be interesting as well looking at like the liner you got a name like Coolio very big artist in the 90s with a very famous song Gangster's Paradise. I'd be interested to see how many people  Like what else you can give to the crowds because it's going to obviously play gangsters pound not play like your biggest hit. Yeah, so it's going to play that and I'd be interested to see how well he can retain like, yeah attention. Is he gonna hold a crowd or he's gonna play that song and then people are going to leave. Mmm and then see like little bands like trophy eyes pretty small band blowing up there. They're one of my favorites from I think Perth are from Western Australia really cool like Little Rock Band go check them out that a new album last year 2018 the year of joy.  The 18 millimeter thick they had a great album Marshall in it. Yeah, I think I think that makes talking of 2018. I think we should have that of look we've got a list here. I saw this on Instagram the other day. I was just scrolling and I saw that they finally released all the information about music sales. So we'll have a look. So this is from the ifpi or the International Federation of the phonographic industry. And what do they do Brendon? What does that mean? I'm not too sure.  Well socially could they have the they have all the stats all the data we need they essentially what they did is. They took all the data from digital downloads sales streams and they compiled into one infographic. So essentially say, what were the best-selling songs of the Year. Number 10. We have good old post. See post Malone - Malone killing the game post Malone Maya. My recent look alike. According to many people. He he blew up from  I'm like YouTube as well. Like he was I mean when he started that he's had some like weird stuff when he was younger, but he's a really talented guy like some people are discarded him in that like because of the type of music he makes and also like his appearances. Yeah for like like he wants yeah parents like like the sort of scraggly hair and the face tattoos, like he doesn't necessarily have very aggressive face tattoos as well and have the family friendly image, but he liked everything you see with him. He seems like a really nice to I super down-to-earth has a  Good voice too like to hear him sing like he can sing. Wow, you got that right? You can play guitar as well his acoustic guitar skills. A man is a talented dude. So that's why he got the number 10 spot with his song psycho alongside. Also a dollar sign can't forget 9.2 million. That's pretty crazy. Pretty crazy. That's is that just like download streams. What's that? So that's aggregate sales. So across downloads across streams across like digital downloads as well. How many platforms are they do dinner? So it's like the major ones Apple music Spotify.  Fi I think they did. I think they did all of it. Like just Everything Everything is Everything. Well, so like Spotify Google play Apple like physical sales explains why it took so long. Yeah. That's why we're only getting it now in March March 6. It came out in 2019. Come along to number nine. We have marshmallow nandamuri that song friends. It's pretty pretty decent song. I remember and a year wrap up like on like MTV and that like I remember being in there. Yeah throughout the year. I can't remember.  Hearing it much on the radio or hearing much of it at all though. Honestly saying the name of that song like I'm not like a huge like pop music tight. Like I don't listen to this early songs on the radio all the time. So like the song start jumping out, but I'm sure if I heard it, I don't know what it is, probably. Yeah, it's one of those songs. You kind of just going to what it is me here like, oh, that's right. You really? Oh my that's cool, especially with marshmallow on a memory to very big names in pop in big names coming together marshmallow. Who is he is he one guy? Is he  He is the one guy his the is he a lot of guys the one with the giant like white? Yeah, but my head but how do you know it's the same guy on there all the time. I bet you he has like a body double for like the hot festivals and concerts. You must do it be like it could be a whole team people is mobile and they just all share like the mantle like, you know, because yeah, it's hard to tell because now it's cool to be such a big name but also knows who you are. It's like Daft Punk.  Daft Punk Daft Punk the he's the new DA Fung putting helmets on kind of yeah and like see a like no one really knows like identity so I can take a walk down the street you could walk past them. We could have a conversation with them and have no idea. That's why you shouldn't do all this thing's we should just leave it for mystery leave it for ya. Don't look it up. Like they don't want it. Don't reduce our eyes. Just let it go man. Number eight Chainsmokers and Coldplay Chainsmokers opinions on them. They became they were black a thing and then they were thing in the neck.  I mean almost 2017 was quite sir. Probably. I don't know because that sounds right closer with like the song that blew them that was there a time. That was that big one Andrew Taggart the lead singer of chainsmokers. I think it is. He also he does right most of the vocals and I think he does a lot of that Tech stuff very hated amongst like the singing Community. He's a bad boy. It is not a bad voice. It's just  he's not the most loved ya just believe he's a bit flat. I mean, I think the thing with Chainsmokers is like their songs. They've got a stick their songs and they all kind of sound the same. Yeah, like I know that's that's coming from someone that doesn't like listen to them. So if anyone's had big Chainsmokers fans, we're sorry. We don't need to offend you are not trying to like talk smack on them giving our opinions. Just kidding. I don't know. We're not supposed to give our opinions, but they have good music. I do like like the audio  All of chainsmokers, it's very like they got some good stuff and I teamed up with Coldplay on something just like this like ten million fireflies a big band that definitely not as big as they used to be but that's a huge name. Yeah, and ten million dollars in sales is nothing to laugh at that's crazy. Right? That's wild. Now number seven number seven is one might surprise you because I was going through the list and I heard of all the songs except number seven be a part by tra who the hell is tra. That's what I thought so I did a bit of research.  Research voiced out of this. She is a Chinese singer and it was a pretty sure it was a theme song for a TV show or a movie. Also. It's not even like just a song like it was for something it was she did it like there's like a music video for the song. Yeah. It's just like a regular music video, but I also saw like a couple results pulling up like a movie so I can come in like, you know how they write a song and then we even if they are yeah, they take it up. Yeah, which is really impressive to think that number seven ten point nine million sales to  One very small. Well not very small. But like in terms of world music usually have like American artists. Yes dominated dominates the scene, especially with pop music just dominates the same sofa number 70 ready to come in to beat people like Chainsmokers post Malone. Marshmallow Coldplay quite impressed. That's a that's a big thing. Like if I hope she's seen this. Hmm, because that's crazy. I listen. It's pretty pretty chill song. It's more of like a ballad kind of song which is good to see interesting.  Run, this just says like pop bangers, but the fact that like she should Chinese he said hmm so that I'm assuming a Chinese audience then the song was in Chinese. Yeah, so that exclusively I'd like a song in Chinese which is like I know trying to like a huge play it is but compared to the entire rest of the world that they themselves would have the majority of the sales have managed to get ten point nine million and put this on a list like that's at number seven to that's  She's killing it speaking of big hits big hits boy despedido. That's besito what Luis fonsi and Daddy Yankee that's macedo was destroyed by the internet like yeah, that's me. See those a good song man. But yeah it definitely thought. Oh, I remember hearing I was this the Justin Bieber version or the AG says Louis Fonzie and Daddy Yankee, so  I think this was the original because I think the original did have more hits the original is better because it's all in Spanish. Hmm. Yeah, because I remember hearing the first song is like the Spanish songs took me back to the Gabriel Iglesias tears and classic. Yeah, it's it's good to see that kind of music making a bit of return. Maybe that's the breakout genre that 2020 will come along Spanish Latino music coming back get the Latino and it's in it. That'd be amazing. Good song though. I was it is a it's a good song. It's bit of a banging me.  Killed it like you can't listen to the song and just be like, okay, this is like this is a good song. I enjoy this song now you'd listen to it and you're like, ah, I've heard in that one video or like it's online. So this is so sad. Yeah like so this is we should get an Alexa for the book. We should just so we can played Esposito. I'm repeating. Yeah coffee strike so hard copy. We don't want copyright. No one reward us for copyright. Yes speaking of memes and getting destroyed by the f-stop segueing into ship Pro game destroyed by the internet Maroon 5.  I've written five killed their own career at the Super Bowl. Did you end up watching that performance? I didn't get I can get through it. I think I was over it was like twelve twelve maybe is 18 minutes. It is anywhere in the span of like 10 to 20 minutes and look ice Love Maroon 5. I still love like the musical Community, but that yeah, I kind of think that past that you have good days and bad days and they just very unfortunately for them. Had a pretty bad.  A hmm on one of the biggest events of the year the most televised American supervise a hard to get right though. Like you look back on the history of Super Bowls. Yeah, but like some people kill the Super Bowl. I do Lady Gaga coming down on like ropes flying in like that killing the Super Bowl and Super Bowl is is very hit-or-miss it is I guess they sometimes Miss huh? Yeah they do and it's a shame because it's like for some it's mainly the big bands they get to play it so  So yeah, you you have to would be cool. It's never going to happen. But I got small or I can get like a breakthrough out us getting like playing the Super Bowl. That's life's changing. Yeah, I would be cool to see so yeah, the song goes like you eleven point nine million sales. That's the version with cardi B with Kobe and well the sound effect Master herself. Cardi B, which my sound board with just an eb-5. Yeah. Yeah.  And what do you what are your thoughts on cardi B? Why don't you there at should give us a bit annoying. It sounds like she's a bit much. She's a lot, but I think she she really Shines on those features like with Bruno Mars. Yeah in like Maroon 5 and my God, DJs and that good good like thing. She's got her own stall like in the rapping and stuff questionable choices. She makes some time. So I'm punches and Nicki Minaj that one of the biggest that's how you get publicity is all what we talk about more rap music. It's all about  About the global bad publicity. That's where you gotta go. But yeah, I think she's alright like she got some good stuff and she's actually gonna be funny like she goes. Oh, yeah. She's pretty entertaining. She's an entertainment ethical. Yeah, and whether it's an act to like maybe she's not always like that but she knows is cameras on a she's like I'm gonna throw my shoe you have someone sometimes with music industry is very hard to tell. Yeah. It's like what's legit was like, yeah and the privacy of your own home when she's with her kid it she just like a normal Mom. Oh, she's like walking on a kid like it's dinner time.  Oh, could you imagine she did a great add the Pepsi at the Steve Carell Pepsi? Did you see that? Yeah, that was a great one of the beautiful things of the super. He's been pulling out some bangers with the pestle General with the Pepsi. I'm going to solve the riots with a Pepsi. Yeah. Look the Super Bowl as you can't go past them for like the people are already content that great the amount of money that people put into this of all my clothes my mind. It's  be more than the sales of these songs to think about it. Yeah. All right. Now we can talk about number four without talking about number three. So the three and four spot held by one man, the ginger leader himself Ed Sheeran. Yeah, the man the myth the legend what a talented dude to have two songs on the top selling list. That's crazy beating out all the big names. Is that a restoration look like I've done this before that insane and top songs forms. I know that Khalid.  He held the number-one and number-two spot for songs at the same time, which is only been done by a copy of I think action did that with these two, so yes with perfect and shape of you and Drake also did it. I'll maybe Castle on the hill but like yeah like yeah something many people have done. It's like Max like five people that's crazy Ed Sheeran's like one of those dudes that you look at him until he's just like he's a normal-looking guy. He's just all right is like the average guy and then he's like crazy talented. Yeah, and that's for sure.  Sure. Yeah, like you listen to his songs like he hasn't had an easy life or anything, but he's made himself what he is and he's still very down-to-earth and like it's crazy what he can do. Like I went to his concert last year would have been almost a year ago by now, I think and he liked it. He goes up on stage and you got a concert and it's these bands and like all these people with the production and stuff. Yeah Ed Sheeran goes I was saved and it is just him and a guitar and a loop pedal. So you need  But this sounds he makes with that is insane because it he fills the whole stadium with just his voice and his guitar and like it's insane. How much happens like you like? Wow, this is just you forget. It's just one guy you think there's like 10 of them up there? Yes, that's why well-deserving perfect number for 13.5 million in sales. And the number three Shep view fourteen point nine million. No, do you still accept who you are? Is it over player down. Did you ever like Shepherd? I would say I prefer.  Now that faith is a good time. Just the original one. You still need you like a bunch of versions of that. He did it with Beyonce as well. I'd say and he did that like classical Andre. Yeah, so he did a couple versions. I'd like the original version of perfect. Just the guitar to like nice song lesser shape of you good song. It kinda is just like a Bop though. It's about they did it a lot. Yeah. It's kind of like you've listened to a couple times like cool. I've heard whatever you need to hear from this song.  Yeah, and now good day is because we love that Sharon. Hmm. Number two Drake. What a legend in the rap modern rap scene coming in. Number two spot God's plan fifteen point three million dollars in sales. Yeah, but Jake like Jake was he was a just a guy it was a guy named Gracie changed so much you look at pictures of him and he was like this skinny little dude and he got dick he um, he's buff dude. He um, did I  Watch the video the other day of like him. He was like 10 years old with his like Dad or on course like a relative or like a friend to someone and he was just doing like some freestyle rap and it was pretty cool. Like he's come a long way and he's really funny as well. Like he's done a bunch of stuff on SNL. I just love that content. But yeah, what do you guys plan? It was really big song while she probably one of the biggest songs in like the iron ball wrapped in a frenzy. I'm a kind of said that I listened to it a heat.  But yeah, like it wasn't about song it did got memed as well. It's hard to be so big and not get me into this point. I think it's all the song in my feelings. The Kiki song as is so affectionately say the Kiki song. That's yeah people jumping out of cars that was put themselves in danger. It's gone a bit far the Astros. That's what comes along. It's all part of God's plan. It's all God, please and then that brings us to the number one spot. Can I get a drum roll, please so you can  Alright, so number one spot Havana Munna Bhai Camila Cabello featuring Young Thug. Yo, this song is very polarizing you ask people about this song and they love it or they hate it with a passion when I when I saw the shot number one, I saw Havana. I was like did that come out in 2018 thought it was like a 20-17 song. I mean if it's under this is the number one song of 2018. It's probably 18 song probably okay teams just feels like so long ago.  That's a good song. It's also what kicked her solo career off. It did branching off from her Fifth Harmony group past and it was good song like I'm not gonna lie. I liked it. I just it's one of those songs like any it had massive song radio mainstream radio very easily can kill a courier what other career but like a song like shape of you was on the radio all the time got killed if I don't honor it was just over played. There's only so many times you can  In a her singing that song. Yeah for you get a bit annoyed like the music video as well for our I didn't seem that. What's the use of yeah, it's like it's kind of like a it's very much throwback to like her Cuban Roots. Yeah, but that's carrots and it's kind of like heavy dancing. It's kind of like a bit of like a love a love story in a music video in which is cool. Yeah. The whole thing is a Love Song now I do you have the stats about that being the number one song. So that is the most stream Song Ever by a solo female.  All artists which is quite impressive Aid 888 million streams across all providers has now been streamed over 2.6 billion times worldwide yo that insane 3.6. Do you know how many people are alive?

How can I forget you great song for 2018 they are working on new music. So hopefully they can come back with a classic so I can only thank you. I don't know if they're gonna numb.  One it like they could they could have know if they could come out of left field hit us. But like it hard to come back like that. I reckon like honestly Jonas Brothers just came back. Yes, if I'm they drop an album of they keep dropping singles. Like they could take that spot. They could have number one like the actual Jonas Brothers are holding it down. Yeah, they came out with soccer, which is a Bop. So that was a good song Waiting for the bang. Okay. I don't know where like did you know that?  We're going to come back. No it wasn't. It was just thinking about well like oh, we're gonna drop a song. Yeah, they came back in like a day and they're just came out of nowhere with a throwback to one of their old like videos and I like we're back and everyone's like lost their mind. They're like cool in 2020 hours are going to release the song and they did and it was a killer song also like blew up to number one great videos. Well, I don't know if you've seen the video. Hey good video solid magic amazing video Amazing song The Bop of the album. I'm waiting for the Banger solid effort by  Them as well like to do all this stuff with like big names like they had so if you turn and all that in the video and like not having that leaked, yeah, I thought no one knew no one knew and that's amazing us. That's like one of the amazing things about like just saying we're gonna drop it in a day. Is it so hard to leak? Yeah. You going to drop it in a day how has anyone can get access that like file that video but it's crazy how like people they act like they gave you a day's notice, but everyone knew the Jonas brothers were coming back like  That news just spread like wildfire. Everyone wanted to hear that any everyone loves the Jonas Brothers the Jonas Brothers the Jonas Brothers have a time like they were a big thing the Disney Legends. I don't know if they like wanted to be necessarily if they'll force to be bit. Okay. Well, I think they came back together. I must have enjoyed watch some of this stuff. They started pretty young like there's videos of them like 13 14. See just the three of them. That's before they got like deal. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, and then they got that show and then  Camp Rock full-scale Roche Lee Camp Rock is a solid films that Demi Lovato is a time. Yeah. That was a dummy. Yeah Conservation Camp Rock to didn't really watch it. I mean but camping Rock. What are you gonna do Disney sequels Disney Channel original sequels the High School Musical. Yeah can't say obvious and it's one really good descendants to follow knows about that. I haven't seen descendants that said Frozen to coming out frozen to dude Keen.  I heard Let It Go the other day. I'm like, this is a good song and everyone like shoots on Frozen because it was so saturated in the media. So little kitchen is a good movie. I think that's a lot of thing with animated like films and TV shows and movies films and movies. The same thing directed at kids is the kids ruin it. Yeah, if you're a parent and you watch Frozen, you're like, oh this is like pretty good me like I enjoy it too and then your kid wants to watch Frozen three times a day every day.  And then also like the marketing and straight just like pumping out toys like have an Elsa doll have a whatever the other chicks now on adult. Yeah, figure and Olaf and yeah Olaf was the kid thing is always like a one thing kids like can let merch minions like same concept. I love the minions were like for the kids, you know, they were like you we can sell that to keep people was it too Despicable Me movies and dominions movie and then was there a Despicable Me 3 I feel something makes me think. Yes. Mmm, that's pretty decent.  And they held us well for an original series. Oh good it is then they drew like I hate minions now. I'm still waiting for the day. Well, I go 24 hours and I don't see him in Yin. I mean I went yesterday. It doesn't mean you know way. I did don't I was home all day. I'm don't believe wasn't on the internet. So that's probably why okay. Yeah, if you open Facebook and you scroll, there's one like Suburban mum, and she has a minion meme ill she's like these my kids a little rascals. Yeah, Bob and Kevin. Yeah, you don't  It's don't don't don't want to probably has a name but name a like Tim his own. There's like a good name for a medium shot at a Tim our friend. You had a good name for a minion.

spotify:episode:2Gwd99cI5FwB7JguV2LPMl	Hello, everybody Welcome to yet. Another forever falling podcast. I'm just joined only by Jake today. Hello. And today we'll be doing a review and preview of QPR and a preview of the Darby gaming midweek. Let's start off with the with the magical game under the lights of the costume Friday night. What were your thoughts Jake? It wasn't good enough from QPR defensively and attacking wise I think we should have put about seven. In jobs is away in the first 20 minutes. Obviously, that's a bit of an exaggeration. But I think that we could have been three and a lot in the first 20 minutes, but we just didn't take our chances and that was what that was what when it for you not yeah, most clinical and yeah, I still think if if you did obviously got a goal in the third minute to get you guys a head if you did and you should of got a second goal even maybe three and if you did go  Second goal. I thought there'd be no coming back for Fulham because we're not one of those teams that like we come back from being Studio to Goes Down And even 20 minutes in I was fully confident that keep y'all get the three points. Hmm. Yeah, I think I was confident myself and I'm not like I'm never usually confident and keep you I'm using quite pessimistic, but I genuinely think I genuinely think that we play at the we look like Barcelona for that for that first 20 minutes.  I'm not exaggerating. Well, it was inside though playing really well. It was also a bit you have to admit to our defensive issues. I thought Ro dark green like moss it like we do. I know ream hit the post he tries to block it but still I defense was shocking like we looked all over. Yeah. Yeah, he if it wasn't for him towards the end. Definitely and I think there was another he did like a great safe at near the  End of the first off I think it was yeah one-on-one. Yeah, there's one on one as well and Nucky well should have should have scored. Yeah should have buried it. Usually he puts him away. No drops of the keeper and rodik. He should I'm very impressed by Road Act and the fuck. He's the only we need to sign up a goalkeeper like Rhoda I've we've been interested in peacock Farrell that you know, yeah, so if we can pick him up,  You are even and get maybe one or two new send a half because I think on fullbacks took cocaine and Ryan and I think Ryan Manning's one of the best left packs in the league. Yeah, but I think when it comes to Center back, we've got the worst offense. I think I don't have I don't know if they didn't actually know their fax my heard. Someone say earlier in the comment section that we're the only team in the football league. That hasn't kept up in. Yeah. I saw that you're obviously at the game. I was watching the sky sports that you were like, I think you're the only one that had  It had had not kept tickling. Gee, you know that. Yeah in the championship I'm talking about like Premier League champion won a league and I think we might be the only teeth. Well that's keep your for I'm guessing in January. You're gonna get your defensive signings in the window.  Hopefully moving on towards the late later in the game. I thought come on at like everyone before the game was like oh God he's coming in for make sure that she's gonna he's probably gonna mess it up for us like the attachment going to score any goals, but he proved all of us wrong and he held up. He like he he's putting the pressure on Mitch which now for midweek because he like, it's really it's really hard when you got two good Strikers.  And like they obviously knew play a formation that doesn't include yeah and like nature which is the obvious first choice, but now come on is coming in Via Ela and here but the thing is he hasn't scored since January. So yeah this could you never know this could be is a is like the start of his comeback since that penalty situation with Mitchell Mitchell. It's all gone downhill. Yeah, that's true but camera but like that's not who button the negatives and being right now.  He sees me but he was fuck. Yeah, he's really good for the night. I thought obviously he got and he stopped options we gave you that second. Yeah, but he's stuck at away quite like it was kind of he kind of Hit the goal in it went into the bottom corner, but for the second goal, but second full of gold, but it was a bit like I know your goal. He's a bit like he's a bit for me. He's not the best last season you get 13 clean sheets. He was really good lost it for me. You need to get someone bit more quality.  In January, we are genuinely yeah and a peacock feather orgasms. Yeah, as you said and like tomorrow's good knockout was good. As you said or even said in Popeyes. He said personally to me. Did you think he was good? Yeah, I think no cotton. Come on over the main people that just terrible odds on defense. I didn't really think I'm I seen the film fans say to me. I didn't actually numbers on a comment section of Instagram post. He said the essay was quiet, but then I responded with I think Kelly  Valero and who did you have a midterm Stefan Johansson or Harrison? Read? Ya know Harrison we'd heard from read. I think Kenny read and causal Arrow really quiet like many wasn't as you just true. You had one song. He had one shot and it just went into Roseate like what cavallaro he tried to end the first half it was one one cavalera should have stuck a chance way hit the post you see waxing at the folks is just do you think cavalera is good enough what?  As as your you had a question. I'll mention it now about do you think komara should start the next game and I I genuinely think he should start instead of cavalera and left-wing. I know it's not he's he he is in Number 9 like his it's not as ideal position, but you can't put him in front of me. He's got he's got he's got pace and kemara knock on and make sure it does sound quite quite nice and also caviola is really good when it  To time wasting because when we got a call and I'm 90s minute he limped off and he went and gave all the players a hug me every every thought was quite every team does that well? I bet it took about two minutes ago. Yeah, but if you winning one now, I you prop I say we're probably the if I was the referee I would you guys I just I just saw like keep your so annoyed at the end. They're like, oh my gosh you we deserve to win that you probably he's probably do.  Yeah. Yeah, I think I think we should play house.  His voice now and see what he has to think. Yeah. So how is voicing is coming in now?  Okay.  Great keep your after 15 minutes from got more into the game, but it was shocking at the start. I don't think full of excelled at off to their full abilities and over the whole game really having 50 of this obsession is boring front of us. We are procession side. That is what we aim for. I thought the QPR shit to us side of it. However, QPR do you have the likes of that world as a cue Gil? I think we did restrict the matter.  I'm get the Sao because he worked his magic as he always starts.  I think that the shots will give us a call from Fulham and I think that Kimura could be one of our knees strike and so we could put it up probably bitch bitch, but he's poor for full of a storm. You always score a pogo stick. It should have been three little up. Yeah, so I think that's the whole overview on the game, but I think that if Kamara you should give Kimora more game time and that would be great for fun. So come on you want  Yeah, I agree with how the about giving come on we'll get in time as we said and we imagine you could be our next number 9 you never know.  Yeah, but thankfully but as you said he's got the wing but he's bought pay so he could play on the window, but I don't see him even with Mitch of it's just being I know he scored two goals, but just because Mandzukic scores two goals when Ronaldo's are for your vehicle. It's going to be very unlikely if he's instead of makes you wish but moving on to mid week against Fulham of got Darby QPR have got just  again lost in the forest oh yes over two Rivals and we both got this arrivals yeah yeah and I think we're going to lose three one and your home Patrick yeah we are and I think our defense is going to make Louis grabbing look like fry Maradona but I think it could be a really insane game that one because both laugh I'm not sure about National Forest is offense but your defense is shocking no offense  and I'm not sure nothing for a second quad best offense not really sure but I think I'll be a lot of goals could um I'm pretty to to actually for keep your Forest really good goalkeeper oh yeah that's true I think for that project critics and she gave me a bit of optimistic so I don't think we can win that I just I love it when there's like  We can gain in the midweek games and reaching I just get so excited. Yeah, nice brilliant cause them but it's funny because we've got not on and for some with Bobby who you've gotten so we've got the two rival. Yeah exactly what we planned our be away. So yeah, you'll probably lose that.  Yeah, well no. Oh, yeah. Yeah, we can talk about Darby now that they they haven't been okay, they haven't had the ideal source for season, but they they started to improve they beat press someone nil in their latest game and okay, they've started really badly kyo's gone and like a Mason mounts gone to Chelsea and lampard's gone, of course, so they haven't been the most positive at the beginning but  Started to get some momentum. Do you agree? Hmm. Yeah, I do. They had really bad start to the season. I remember there were 19 foot one point and they for it back. They have look erased wrong side of his you getting that one nil win over Preston on Preston Preston and the weekend which was a big result for them obviously pressed and being a really like since our candidate for promotion this year. Yeah. So what are your predictions for our film game at the cottage?  Oh, so I think for Lamar got what was Daddy I think they're going to draw 2-2 all similar to you and ask I think Martin why corn is going to score twice the Darby and I think Mitch row and Kenny will score for you not AK-47 no more all depends on my free starts. Oh, yes true. But I feel of it. I feel a bit defensive a shake.  We're going to I think we can fit this in the bag. Like I think it could be a tuner or to 1/2 the whites because I think we all know they've had a good start being a bit better recently Darby, but I think we still got the quality to go out there and get the three. Yes, but but are you a bit?  supported that  the force that far having the world's biggest net value of a team that you've got 116 million the most expensive League. Well, like I always say like I think you've heard me say this before we always start playing better towards the end of the season and yeah, but that like for our promotion playoff campaign, like we've got to the Premier League this time last year. We were literally mid-table.  Like I mean, there's no point during the playoffs were like mid-table like that playoff season. So yeah, I think we will start to kick in do you do you think we'll get for motive? It's quite a big question.  I mean your fourth which isn't bad. Yeah, but there's loads of teams that are like joint with us has been really close to Championship. So three points off like seven, I think so. Yeah when against forest and then be Dhabi we could even fall into yeah, like chicks like you can get like there's a few wins you can go so far like you got the table if results go your way after a couple of games you can be tough, but I think full um,  I don't I don't I don't think you're going to get automatic. I think that will be leads and West Brom. I think you'll definitely get to the finals with the playoffs alongside. Let's say Preston. Okay, but what do you win that water? Wait and see but yeah, I think I think you have the ability and the quality to get promoted. This is whether you use that quality. Yeah my QPR like final prediction I'd go for  I think you'll get about maybe like tenth or just just above the playoffs if we have a good window we can maybe get sick if we play well. If not, we can maybe get 8 4/10 but yeah, so so that was what's not. Yeah, this is house.  This is house view on the Darby preview.  I think the doggy game is going to be a wonderful game. I hope I get to go. So Darby 11 from 24 points and full of for 429 post. There is a big difference there. However, Preston who are exceeding amazingly well lost 1 L 2 Darby recently, but Darby did have quite a bad start to the season so they've got lots of threats.  Stay this Jade of Bogle. He's got the own goal in the East mist and star be Tom Lawrence who should be in jail. There's the Forest Friends charm. So overall I think that the type of game will be a great game really tough because obviously you played in the playoffs. I think the Fulham can easily win it but it will be time to difficult because the difference in points is only five and the places is 7 so  As I obviously want for them to win but it's under lights again and we're doing quite well on for the lights so home. So we've got all the fans behind us. But let me go to restrict those threats and we've got to improve our ability. I hope Kumar starts as well and my match prediction. It's going to be 3 1 to the to the whites. And yeah as I say again, I think we can do really well and if it gets three points that great come on your thoughts.  Yeah, that was quite a good point by house saying I'm only five five-point difference but seven places showing how closely Championship can be that shows because if we lose the Derby today and who you got in the weekend, I mean tomorrow Tuesday. Sorry. What do we go? We've got a Swansea on a another Friday night. So there's a whole game. So if you lose both of those and Darby get two wins on the truck against Fulham, and yes, Dobby will be above yeah exactly subjects that shows how good a championship.  It is yeah, that's why I love the championship even more than the Premier League. Yeah, no definitely so you love to go up there just for the money. Yeah, of course one last question and I'm just going to see who this is from. This is from the Instagram. So we do questions. Yeah, I made a point is I think the whites the whites Fulham can win easily. I don't think it's going to be easy. I think you'll be a tough game. Yeah.  I think though equalize them will get a win but the question is from Harry underscore n c l-- underscore o6. He said if you were films arch-rivals, this is quite a simple question. I I think it's probably the obvious one you'd go forward probably QPR and Chelsea.  And yes, it seemed with QP. I'm guessing like yeah, I'm Brent for Frost and millwall. Ooh, and then everyone but yeah, we got Brent for Darius a bit of a cur irrelevant. Yeah full member if it isn't really that that day. Yeah, it's big but it's not massive. Yeah. Yeah. It's not a massive star be okay. So I think that's the end of the podcast. I think that was really interesting forecast will probably be next. Probably me and he'll and will be after Dhabi game before.  For the Swansea away, so I'll probably be maybe Thursday or Wednesday and come on you whites and I'll see you guys next time keep your plate full of free now. Oh really you are.

And so when that book was out I wanted to for it to do well and I created packages where I would trade, you know, an enormous amount of book sales for me showing up somewhere and I get this email from Ted in Chattanooga and he came in heavy and hot and I was thrilled. I mean I'm agnostic about where I go when you have the kpi of the results you go anywhere.  I didn't realize there wasn't a direct flight to Chattanooga that was a little bit complicated. But other than that I got there and then what took over is the same reason most of the good things in my life have happened which is within the first eight minutes of being on the ground. I just you know intuitively was like this is an interesting place and it wasn't, you know, a lot of times later on people manipulated to it was the fiber or this and that it was strictly the human beings and just the  gut feeling I had navigating through the different businesses and people that I met at the macro level. I'm trying to build a very serious Communications company and my biggest concern in building. It is getting too much in The Silo of New York or LA or London. And so I give a lot of thought about where to open up offices to make sure that you're getting a flavor of all the  Brent mindsets and angles and nuances around the world let you know as somebody who you know as career took a big turn when he started investing in Silicon Valley startups what you were just saying on stage that I caught, you know, not only are the costs and competitive landscape of talent different in Silicon Valley and Chattanooga, but the entire ecosystem of how one sees the world and I think one thing everybody in this room can appreciate his perspective is incredibly important and  you need different perspectives to achieve big things. And so there was a very macro ambition for me to open offices and places. That weren't like La San Francisco New York and nuga ended up being the first one. We as a Chattanooga native. I certainly appreciate that. It's interesting. I talked to a lot of you know, we sit at the intersection of Silicon Valley with Freight and we're venture-backed as well. So we're in constant dialogue and I can empathize and relate with the founders in the valley.  but in many ways I find that even the most successful companies that have raised Venture funds that are in San Francisco often times don't have his deep context about the industry that they're just a ton of success and you can't you have to give them credit for the success, but it's interesting because someone who has deep Market context often times those companies don't and wondering when you look at your outside of New York outside of San Francisco and a lot of freight companies are  graphic dispersed of Midwest and Southeast. What do you see that's different about those particular entities than out in the valley. Well in the valley, you know, as many people here know enormous percentage of those companies are started by extremely young people and so they have no context of any of this tree the other thing that many may know in this room, but may not is one of the biggest reasons I've walked away and didn't start a venture capital firm.  The back of being an early investor in Facebook and Twitter and Uber. I had all this momentum and some were about seven or eight years ago. I realized how much I didn't enjoy, you know, investing and more importantly investing in companies that weren't actually building companies. They were building Financial Arbitrage machines, you know, most of the companies in Silicon Valley today are built to raise another round of fundraising and then sell to a bigger company or  right now because the IPO Market is hot go public. It's all math. It's all Excel sheet. It's all CAC and LTV. It's legitimately not but like I'm not kidding here. And this is it's not a Raz. It's just not what I'm interested in. I'm far more like, you know, I come from a growing up in a liquor store. That was a family business baseball cards. Like I'm a merchant I'ma build a business kind of guy. Yeah. I just it's very awkward to watch.  And sit in meetings where everything is about pandering to more Capital not to executing for your customer. So I mean, is it a bubble or is this just a phenomenon? You think it's a bubble? I do and where is the end? Is it who buries IPO if I knew that I'd be quicker to my path of buying the New York Jets. I don't know and and by the way, I could also be disproportionately wrong. Like I I think I'm already wrong. I would have never thought.  Thought that we could be here 11 years, you know the way we solved two thousand seven eight nine s economic issue felt like such a bandaid that I thought was going to lead to such horrible Behavior, which it has but I would have never thought that the global economy and the US economy would have been able to sustain 11 years of hyper growth during that kind of bad behavior. Just funding unlimited, you know, look, I think one thing I hope you'll appreciate here for the next 55 minutes. I'm going to stay in my  Lean, I'll talk about things. I know and I won't talk about things. I don't know the macro rationale to the global economy is something above my paygrade. It's just not where I spend my time, you know, obviously there's an enormous amount of capital coming in from SoftBank from Saudi Arabia from other places that I think continues to maintain it, but this is the greatest era of fake entrepreneurship ever.  Because they're just so much money in it. Right? I mean for everybody in this crowd that's over 40 years old. Like I am myself we didn't grow up in a world thinking that our idea was worth four million dollars.  And that is absolutely what the average you know, Highly Educated 21 year old sitting in college thinks she or he thinks that whatever idea they come up with they should go and easily be able to get a million dollars on a four million dollar valuation for the Uber of sneakers, but it's interesting because there have been some successes. And so how do you define you talk about faking entrepreneurship versus real entrepreneurship? How do you how do you know when you look at a deal? How do you know which is which is which you don't?  So what so you've made some significant Investments early stage Investments. Yeah, but I've stopped Uber was one of those. Yeah, I mean but I've stopped but I've stopped because in two thousand six seven eight nine ten when I would sit down with an entrepreneur she or he was an entrepreneur because entrepreneurship was coming out of an era where it wasn't on a pedestal right now. Everybody wants to be an entrepreneur because it's legitimately cool, which is just wild for me to think about, you know, like just the way  Being a businessman or woman wasn't cool in 1992 and was Bill Gates, you know, like fucking nerd, you know, like so so now that everybody wants to put entrepreneurship in their Instagram profile and that's cool in the club. That is just Bizarro world, but that's also done what sports and wrapping has which is everybody wishes they are and what's different about entrepreneurship Than Rap and sports is  When you say you're a rapper someone's like all right wrap and then if you guys suck everyone's like oh you suck. And when you say you're a basketball player people are like at the YMCA or or going to the league, but when somebody now says they're an entrepreneur. It's just accepted and we haven't matured into are you a successful entrepreneur or a wannabe entrepreneur and I, you know to be very Frank I'm concerned about it because I think the one thing I love about  Stupid or ship is it's binary either you're going to win or you're going to lose and I think that there's a lot of people right now that are not built with dealing with the emotional baggage that comes along with a public loss. And so I spent a lot of time with young entrepreneurs around the mentality of like when you lose, you know, are you ready to take that ridicule? And what are you going to do? But you don't I think the one you know, one of the ways you can is look in the rare occasion that aisle.  Make a investment these days. I like people who've already built a real business. You know that one of the ways you can do it, you know as I've evolved I get way more into the jockey than the horse so much of the money I've lost and investing was the idea was great and I would have run it successfully but I bet on somebody who never run a business before and again so many people here know running a successful business has way more to do with emotional intelligence.  Then the ability to know how to make a good decision about a product or service. You can build a great SAS product. You can have all your CAC and LTD properly figured out you can have a lot of things right but as a CEO, if you do not know how to build a comfortable culture that creates retention and you know and many other variables you're going to be vulnerable through actual business long-term. And so I'm very much on the kick now of the Jockey over the horse.  Essentially say that because I think about my own life and I think the most significant times in my life and then when I fell and felt in a really sort of public way and just for my own Clarity a macro failure like out of business or a micro failure of them in a business failure, like I'm a crow look out of business. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I for me it was at a business. Yeah, because I think and I apologize for jumping in and please continue, but I think I'm obsessed with micro failures.  I'd prefer not the macro failure. Right? Like I always think the business survived I just didn't okay. That's a personal like when you run out of cash. Yeah, they make decisions. But I wonder it's interesting because you think about that and that, you know sort of informs you much better because you sort of have this I think the thing pattern recognition right? It's that you've seen this movie will you sign it? And and for me it was this first time I always sort of been in a having a family that has successful entrepreneurship. You sort of see the  What a successful entrepreneur does as you're a kid growing up and you see your dad build business. He went through tough time. And I remember having conversations were times that they were tight on cash and things were not always in the early days. We're not always great but I didn't see that as a kid because I idolized my father and I Look to Him as this sort of God of business and I never understood that he had gone through these that had he had had tougher skin because he had to do it and he had seen his father doing substance. So when I truly sort of fucked it all up when I truly like  it was in for me. So first time I ever felt what it was like to completely just be done. Yeah and had felled in a way that people knew and that was humiliating. But what what it taught me was that I could I could I could do it again. I could I could I did that it was painful and it sucked and you never want to go back there. But you also are now, you know, you can survive it you can rebuild and I think that was a much more powerful less than if you just had unlimited success and in some ways in my early 20s, please.  Had a platform inside of my dad's business that enabled me to build a very successful business and so I was sort of insulated and I thought well that's what success is because you have this platform. It's easy to build a really successful business when you already have an infrastructure having to do under owns quite different and and that was so the first time I realized it and so it's interesting you say that you look for successful businesses. But I also Imagine the character of the story is also important to you it is but to your point like the path to Success is Not  Rate, right and so you're right. You look under the hood, but you said something super important and now I'm just going to be raw for a second because this is going to bleed into parenting as much as it is entrepreneurship, you know, the greatest thing that happened to you was getting punched in the mouth the greatest reason, I believe that we're living through such fake entrepreneurship right now is not only is there an enormous amount of capital in play for these 20 to 25 year olds, but they're the generation, you know that was parented in a way that tried to  Eliminate losses from the ecosystem. I mean this is the generation of eighth place trophies, right? This is you know, my favorite thing that's going on in society right now is 45 to 60 year olds, you know clowning on Millennials and making fun of them and I keep looking at them and I keep reminding them that you parented these kids. Everybody gets a trophy, right? Yeah, I mean and so, you know, we've demonized to these kids losing I love losing.  Like micro losing especially more than macro losing is incredibly motivating. You know, I mean, there's nothing more fun than losing regular-season games, you know, you learn from them, you know, come the playoffs you'd like to build on that. But yeah, I mean II think adversity is the foundation of success being born in the Soviet Union living in a studio apartment with a family members when I was a kid going on one and a half baked ations my entire childhood my parents buying me nothing because they didn't have like the money nor the mines.  To do that for me is fundamentally. The reason I'm successful at entrepreneurship. I'm not scared of anything nor do I care about anybody else's judgment, which allows me to navigate very quickly and my losses are my losses and my wins are my wins and they both feel the same when I hear the accolades or when I get razzed. I basically can't hear them. I'm just so in love with the process and that's and that's what getting up off the floor is  Is you had no choice you just it's in your DNA to want to play. Yeah, you know like, you know, and I think that self-awareness for the executives and the founders and the different people in this room is an incredibly important foundation to the conversation right now both for the entrepreneurs but also for the key Executives and employees of an organization and the responsibility of the number one to put players in the best position to succeed is a Formula that really matters. It's funny you say that I  So I didn't I think entrepreneurs have this thing after a sort of a big loss where you have this people writers talk about writer's block. The can't I couldn't think of anything that was interesting. I remember I took a job selling Employee Engagement Services, which was not fun at all. Like the fact that the business exists is fat and I don't always in that business here, but I remember I went back to Chattanooga and I went and speaking of Ted again. I was in his office and that was what the hell are you doing? Like why aren't you an entrepreneur?  Why don't you get back in the game? And he was the guy sort of pushed me to say get back into it like go back and do it. And the thing was this time. It was sort of Phyllis. I didn't care. I knew what it was like and I burned a bunch of cash day trading because I thought that was I was going to make my fortune don't do that either and I opened up at a Bank of America zero in Taiga credit was anything that really had and open up a zero credit zero balance or zero APR credit card and I ran up $50,000 Bank of America is my first investor, and it was fun to kind of get back in.  Game, they don't know that I did pay it off which was actually fun. But it was fun to get back in the game after having done it and sort of saying that hey there is a sort of a natural desire but I think what drives has driven me and I would imagine it drives other entrepreneurs that is that they've had sort of this fake success. They thought there was a classical and then it all went away and then they had to go back and build it again. Well good because that's what we're going to see in the next chapter this year the amount of people that celebrate when they  Andres is laughable. I mean 98 percent of Silicon Valley startups lose money each month.  Like I don't know if you heard but it doesn't take a hero to lose money each other up. So yeah, I mean a lot of them think that they're successful yet. They haven't made a single Cent In profit, which is the lifeline of a business that isn't in a position to raise more capital and I do think that what's amazing about the game is here we are and we're talking about when will it happen. What's the bubble and literally tomorrow you could wake up and bear Stern can happen and it starts to Domino the other direction and it's that quickly.  Right, you know you got an entrepreneur sitting now in year three and she's about to turn the corner right? She's been losing 80,000 a month and now two more months and she's gonna have this or that or the other thing and we're going to be making money and all of a sudden, you know, they you know, they're on, you know, third and 1/2 base on raising their next round which will give them that are cover and boom the news comes out in the morning that XYZ Bank. Does this or the college debt crisis has done wire.  Or China did Z and the investor pulls out. Nobody else is interested and six months later. They're not a business. Yeah. So what is your message to those startups? And there's some of the room make profit. It's that simple, right? Yeah, I can't argue with that. So, you know like  And and to the startups in the room, like if this kind of hit you like, huh, that makes some sense or you got your spidey say senses going like you go and audit your expenses. Like what are you paying for fruit bars or you know, like, you know, who's the three employees that bring no value to the company anymore, but you have a sense of loyalty like run an actual business and I think that overfunded  added lots of money in the system is no different than being a super spoiled kid, you know, like if your parents buy you a BMW on your 16th birthday. You're soft. Yeah.  It's nothing wrong with being soft. There's nothing wrong with being soft. But you're fucking soft. So let's talk about you mentioned cold chills talking about culture and I've you've talked about this is that people who are who are dragging down the culture of a business should be they shouldn't be there. You should get rid of immediately. I am a big fan of this. Let's talk about this is I mean, this is it's interesting because there's there's a view of higher slope.  Are fast and there's also a view of if you have someone who's cancer was to your business. I think a lot of businesses get caught up in trying to document and coach and it just it just goes nowhere right if their cancer I wish most businesses weren't to documenting and Coach what most businesses are doing is Heralds of dick, but his numbers are remarkable.  Yeah, that's what's really happening. That's what I'm referring to that if you've got somebody who's driving top line revenue, or is she or he is crushing the numbers what most companies are doing is they're looking at surface level. They're like ooh, if we fire Carol, we're going to lose those three accounts because she's so wired in there what they don't realize is the hidden lost Revenue that's happening with Carol or Harold destroying the culture and completely  Messing up the continuity and speed of the macro. So what do you do from your point of view? What do you do? If you have if you have someone who's really kicking ass bringing the numbers in and they're just a they're a jerk. What do you do with them? What I do one one man's point of view is I sit them down. I looked him dead in the face and I say you think I'm joking because you're delivering, but I'm not joking and if you can't be a good human being I'm going to fire your face.  That's that's pretty right there. Right? That's what I do and I do it and I do it. You know, I'm a big shot on stage now and I'm acting tough. I do it. I do it in a conversation. I'm like, look, I'm not Kiddin like I know you don't believe me because you've worked in other places that value dollars and I value dollars. I just value slow dimes, right? And so you're gonna screw me up you're not liked. There's a problem here a it's my fault because this is my company. So tell me what I've done wrong to  You in this position. Do you hate Stevie or something going on at home? Like what am I missing nine out of ten times, you're missing nothing. It's just unfortunately, you know, because before we even get to that conversation you you're trying to figure out what's wrong and then 3 out of 10 times remarkably people do take a left turn because they get scared straight or they had it in them or normally they're insecure and so I spent 40 of the 50 minutes. I'm trying to make them feel safe. Yeah and and 7 out of 10.  Time 10 times you fire their face. How long do you give them? You know, it's funny. It's run the gamut and you know, when I think about these 25 conversations as we're talking right now one makes me laugh because it I gave him 24 hours because literally the next day they like we're ridiculous other times. It's been a couple weeks a couple months not usually more than two months after that conversation for me, but everybody has their own tolerance. It's remarkable what happens when you make that decision the buy-in from the  To the crew that you knew because most employees think that the big boss that she or he have no idea what's actually going on that they live in an ivory tower that they don't know what's going on in the details that that employees tricking them that they're looking the other way because of money. So when you deliver on culture the buy-in in the macro is remarkable and what it does for the business is extraordinary. I'm a I'm a pot committed buyer of this thesis that you have to fire.  The best performers that are destroying your culture. How big is your team? What's the size better? Media is a thousand people. Wow. Okay and how long you guys been around? We've been around for nine and a half years nine and a half years. And so you've hired a lot of people. Yes, you've also interviewed a lot more people. Yes, when you bring someone in to the organization, do you interview every single candidate? I do not I did the first 300 I would say, okay, and I do obviously at a certain seniority level.  And I try to meet with every employee within the first year, but I don't hire everybody. That's probably a good thing because I'm probably an all-time ridiculous higher. I usually hire people within the first three minutes in my head and I actually have our I have no I literally walked round of questions for you. You're gonna lie. Anyway, like who cares? Let's just get to it. I am the same way. I think his problem. Well, sometimes I work too hard.  Like interviewing is what is the worst? What is the worst response you've ever gotten on it? But that I hate that question. Like what's your heart? What's your shortcoming? Like what's a cliche reason you struggle sometimes, you know Gary sometimes I get so passionate about my work that I work extra hard and burn myself out get the fuck out of here. So what is the best answer to that question or the best type of the truth? Right like sometimes I undermine my fellow employees because I want a bonus, you know.  You know, honestly I go on intuition. I hire remarkably fast. I fire slower than I'd like but I've gotten faster over the last 25 years. Yeah as you get more confidence and I hate negativity and in that I think I've created too much entitlement and have kind of like tried to fix the bad boy too much and over time. I've just gotten better experience matters, so  I'm sure is you were one of the First Investors in Uber at the time. It was a it was an unknown start up. What about that business and talk about culture a lot has been said about overs culture and I'm wondering when you first heard that pitch a what did you like about the pitch and then be what is your perspective on the culture issues that have been written about over so I got a long-winded story here. I'll try to go fast number one and if you literally Google my name and  Uber and Paris like right now in your phone Gary vaynerchuk Uber Paris, you'll read a Business Insider article. This is just fun for me one day for my grandkids. I was not only am I an early investor in Uber and we'll get to that in a minute because I'm not as early as I should because I passed on the angel round twice like literally Travis came back to me and had coffee with me in San Francisco and kind of like begged me to invest because we were such homies my first book crush it. The only people I acknowledge in the book is my family and one random person.  Travis he was investing at that time before Uber and like read the book and gave me some good feedback. Like literally that's how close I was with Travis and I passed twice on the angel Round And if I wrote my normal 25 to 50 thousand dollar check, I would be looking at somewhere in the ballpark of 500 to 800 million dollars in the next couple of months. So that would be considered a loss and entrepreneur land.  But I was literally in the room when it was invented Garrett Camp who was the founder and inventor of a company that some of you might remember called stumble upon which was a cool website back in the day. Literally literally I can it's crazy. I'm sitting in the couch post this keynote. I gave at late web 2008, I think nine. He's sitting on the ground right over there having like some whiskey and he looks up at like eight people he goes. You know, what do you think about a limb? What do you think? Would it be cool if?  On your phone there was an app and you could order a limousine that could pick you up right away. And I remember the first hot second. I'm like that's a rich person's problem. Right? Like I'm like, yeah, okay fine, but like and and then a couple months later I saw him and he's like, hey that thing we're doing it's real. It's called Uber cab now, that's the original name of uber Uber cab. And at first they it was a side project because Travis was investing Garrett, I think.  Bought back StumbleUpon from the company AOL. I can't remember who bought it and they literally hired another person to be the CEO and Outsource the building of it. So it was a side project. So the biggest reason I didn't invest was because it was a side project that a couple months later Travis jumped in ran it and it became what it became as far as the culture, you know, listen at the end of the day. This is why I speak so much about culture. I'm  Early on I have no concept during that era Travis went super like head down and I spoke to him like three times this book to Garrett zero times. I I had you know, I'm not on the board. I'm not an Advisory board. So I have as much insight to the culture as you do which is you're reading it through the press and through employees posting on blogs. And so you take it for what it is, but ultimately it was enough pressure for Travis to not be running the company he built which is something every entrepreneur would fear and not want to  Happen it's why it's super important is there's been the IPO coming up. He's not going to be the ringing of the bill. Do you think that's the right decision for Uber? I didn't know that until they cannot let him on the stage. It's too bad. You know, it's look what I don't know is how look everything stems from the top. So the culture is is on him.  I'm fascinated by the board's power. Like I'm very caught here three variables running through my head in real time one. I'm skewed because Travis is my friend. So already I'm not a clean piece of data to even if he wasn't and I didn't know him. I'm always Pro operator anti board, right because the operators in the trenches the board is on the sidelines.  Pontificating I don't know why they decided to do that. I understand it, you know, the the probably massively distracting. I'm sure everybody wants the stock to do. Well Travis is on to his next thing. Anyway, I wonder how much he cares or doesn't care. But you know, somebody's already built one business that he doesn't operate anymore, which was the building of my dad's liquor store business into an e-commerce Giant in the wine space watching my best friend and my dad operate that.  Company is heartbreaking. I know the feeling I could because they're not running at the way. I would want to run it. So when you build something and it goes into a different place, it's tough. You know, I have a lot of I mean ultimately like in a lot of ways. That's the right decision a lot of ways. It's the wrong decision. I think ultimately like who gets to judge. I don't know when you're a Thanksgiving dinner or your family. Do you did you have a tendency to tell them what to do what you would do? What was we had such a weird ebony flow right? Because  I got into my dad's business. My dad comes to America with a hundred dollars in his pocket and in seven years owns his own liquor store. It's such a remarkable accomplishment. I come into my dad's business. It's a 3.8 Million Dollar business doing ten percent gross profit and I build it from that to a 60 million dollar business in six years with no Capital no credit line. And so there's these two massive Dynamics in play, right which is you know, immigrant makes good. Whiz kid  Like it's a it's a real interesting tension and you couldn't find two operators who agree only on 10% and then disagree on 90% more than me and my dad and so there was constant friction, which was very aggressive in a good way and a not so good way family business Dynamics now that I've been out of it for let's say really out of it for the last four or five years. I don't because I'm Pro.  Operator anti board. Have you learned the hard way? Like no, I have it. I it was he I don't want to be a hypocrite about that the second I stopped running it day to day. They got to run it. Yeah at my two cents or bullshit. I keep him to myself. They asked me a lot and I'm thrilled but I'm just unbelievably not interested in throwing my two cents at something. I'm not willing to operate because I don't like when people do that to me. I love when people like I love when employees  Carrie you know what you don't know. I'm like tell me Sarah tell me what I don't know, you know, like people, you know, think about for everybody here when you started your career and you manage nobody how much you shit on your manager and then the second you started managing people. You got a totally different perspective right? Remember all those things you thought about your parents until you became a parent, you know, I just I just think people are funny when they don't sit with all the context right one of my favorite reasons to sit with employees.  I do it a lot is for those conversations when somebody gets a little bravado and starts throwing stuff at me. I always treat that with respect and then I throw 87,000 things that them that they have no idea about and then they leave with their tail between their legs and I feel pumped. I I can empathize with that Daniel Pickett. So I wanted to dive it. You have a board by the way. No, you don't have or this is you completely bootstrap this business. Yes.  And it was your what your dad's wide business that you built online you built this massive business and you probably picked up for but I didn't parlay it. What I did was this interesting part of my story I built my family business, but I'm an immigrant not an american-based family business what that means is it's the dad's business until he dies. So I built this business from three to 60 million and at 34 years old because we poured all the money back into the business and I never paid myself more than $100,000 a year. I go and start Vayner.  Area with my brother and I have to start it in the conference room of Buddy media a great SAS business that did extremely well and so the Salesforce because I had no money, right? So you have this great accomplishment on your resume of building this monster business and you have no Financial benefit from it I should credit I had nothing so at 34, I bootstrap Vayner the one great thing. I had to hovering we mentioned it earlier even though I didn't pay myself more than seventy eighty a hundred.  A thousand back to like making money versus spending money running a p&l. I lived in a shitty apartment. I bought nothing and I worked every day. So I had over this eight year period you know a hundred two hundred thousand dollars saved and then I invested all of it. I took my bank account to 0 because I decided Silicon Valley was going to happen and the first three companies I invested in word Facebook Twitter and Tumblr right? And so I'm rich but more importantly than that.  When I started Vayner when I started Vayner in 2009, it was already obvious that Facebook was going to win it was obvious that Twitter was doing super well, so I had no money but I had these assets that were looming that I had some confidence on and then I bootstrapped vaynermedia and it's just completely through social media. That was how you built it and YouTube or vaynermedia the company itself at that point. I'd written. Oh right when I started vaynermedia crush it came out for months.  Later, and it was the book about social media that became kind of this book on the back of what I did in the wine business more but it built awareness around me which led to a couple of first clients for vaynermedia Pepsi Gillette and that started the process and why did they want you is it just because you could reach it you reach a different audience. I at that point had eight hundred thousand Twitter followers and Pepsi the business had 400. Wow, and they were like, why do you have that and people are  Going to understand that there was something in the air about social media. And at first our company was $5,000 a month to do community management for Brands. So camels paid us $5,000 a month to reply to people on Twitter. And remember the old Facebook where every comment showed up on the wall. And so we you know, people be like Campbell's your soup sucks and we're like, sorry, you know, so at first it was Community Management and  Then it evolved from there. So, you know Freight transportation is a very older it's you know, it's a very old industry and up until recently there hasn't been a lot of venture investment. And so where we talked about the bubble the bubble didn't you know, I think there's arguments whether is a bubble and I think the great ones of view, it's still there hasn't been a substantial if you take like fintech and and and broader consumer plays and brought her internet plays. It's a very small amount of money to us.  Going really fast and it's growing exceptionally fast, but one of the things I find interesting is the traditional freight companies don't understand marketing companies that the only ones that are doing a good job of it are the big parcel companies, which is really, you know, FedEx and UPS, which is because they're more consumer-centric. That's right. So the B2B says a lot of folks in this room that are predominately B2B and what you guys have massively felt the benefits of is something that I've been yelling about for a half a decade which is if you're in B2B, you have to act like a media company not an Advertiser.  ER FedEx and UPS or advertisers, you know, you're acting like a median properly we do but I think the broader audience in this room when you look at Mark, what is it? I'd love for you to tell them to spend money with me, but I'm not going to do that. What is it that you would recommend to folks in the room that as you think about marketing branding you talk a lot about taking advantage of social media take advantage of Facebook and Linkedin as one that you do. I'd love for you to dive into the future of media and marketing the advice that I think will play for.  But in the room regardless of what you do including if like you're the PTA president or thinking about running for local office, like I have no idea what you want to do professionally or personally, but the one thing that has been tried and true and I keep things extremely simple is you have to reverse engineer the audience you're trying to reach and you have to tell them something that brings them value. Not you value.  Very simple it is this simplest model of it. I think most most marketing and PR agencies that we talked to it's you get the copy if they write it. It looks like marketing company. Nobody's going to read it when we were in our journals, right? It is an editorial piece where it's written in a way that's written more like a journalist read it he gets read it because it's not overflow it and that's not just about us but he's a PR Company and the salesperson are in the business of selling and a journalist is in the business of informing.  It's fundamentally different like the biggest reason I've popped is every piece of content. I put out a LinkedIn Facebook YouTube by podcast. I'm desperately trying to figure out how does this bring value for the other person not how am I going to sell vaynermedia or sneakers or wine the end? It's it's unbelievably basic. This is like Bible shit. Yeah, and you pop out a lot of content and you do that. I mean a substantial amount of content. One of my favorite things is your micro videos is  Taking you have a videographer that follows your or they're here. By the way. He was just chasing somewhere. I'm sure but we have it filming right there. So but you film yourself.  And you take parts of that and turn it into product. I'd love for you to hear three years ago. I took a very interesting move that I probably debated for six-month talk about someone who genuinely doesn't is very capable of taking negative and positive feedback lives a life where he's comfortable navigating through judgment. And even for me it took me a good six months to say, okay. Am I okay with a human being follow me around and filming me at all time.  Is heavy charlatan heavy like it's uncomfortable territory, especially three years ago, but I saw blogging voting on YouTube and the vloggers were first person and I'm not I'm running a huge company. I'm an executive. I'm not going to be walking around with a camera like this. I'm also not a filmmaker or have that talent, but I knew that if I would fill my day to day that I could put out a vlog and show real entrepreneurship, you know instead of  Like the watches and the baby giraffes and traveling and you know, I wanted to show people like meetings and work and like the stresses of actually running a business and to I knew that I would be able to make this micro content, you know, the amount of pieces of content that I put on LinkedIn that get two three four million people to see it and all it was was 47 seconds. I mean it's going to happen here one or two of these questions is going to be cut down and put on LinkedIn and it's going to bring awareness to who I am which then  Bring awareness to the things I do or the things I believe and so yeah, I believe not only do I believe every business is a media company. I believe every humans a media company and I also am very comfortable with somebody not liking that people don't like personal brands or when I make that statement that like and that's fine. You don't have to be a media company, but you can be I'm not telling you that you have to do it. I'm telling you that there's a lot of opportunity around it and it's not that hard right with social media.  Leah I mean there are in trucking there are truck drivers which have 1020 30,000 40,000 followers. They use a GoPro or they use their iPhone and they're in the cab talking about story. They're breaking stories faster than sometimes we break them and we have professional journalists and it's interesting because they bring perspective. They have these sort of cult like thought their Heroes of the driving Community, but there's no investment and I'm wondering if companies that do billions of dollars that do a  Or a job of communicating their brand and their values their whether it's recording drivers or extinct the brand then these truck drivers and and not dismissive. They're smart as hell that do it in the cab of the truck and and you talked a lot about that watch this real quick. If you can appease me, it's early. It's good to get blood flowing real quick. If you are now a human being that mainly watches HBO GO Netflix Hulu or DVR that if you mainly  Zoom your TV now in a OTT Netflix kind of environment, please stand up real quick just stand up if the far majority of TV you watch outside of live sports is done in this environment. I'm going to wait. I want to make sure everybody does this let's look around. I want everybody look around. Let's all agree that this is not a fifteen-year-old teenage crowd right and cheese 8090 percent. You can sit. Thank you 80 to 90% of this audience now mainly  Just television without even the ability to see a commercial. Yeah, right and for the 10% that we're still sitting that when they watch Network TV shows right or cable news that when it goes to a commercial they grab their phone and live their life. They're not sitting quietly and patiently to consume a TV commercial 70 billion dollars is spent in America a year to produce and distribute TV commercials.  Not a soul is consuming them. Hmm Super Bowl. Yes, I would buy Super Bowl all day long, but that's exactly what you just said. It's happening in every facet of every part of the land people are spending enormous amounts of money on what worked yesterday and they're demonizing what's happening today. Yeah. I mean I look at my look at my kids. My son's I have two kids don't like it. I apologize the rear end and then I'll let you go. The reason I said, this is not a fifteen-year-old crowd the argument about Facebook and YouTube and social media.  Everybody goes into I look at my kids and they do X. I'm trying to remind you that these old fuckers do that too. It's rare, but it lightly but that but that matters right because what businesses do is there like Gary I see you're right. I see it with my kids. I'm like no. No the 57 year old guy that you're trying to reach. He's not seeing that television commercial either. So let's have a conversation.  No, I think that's its spot on getting to two kids. They're my kids YouTube. They don't watch they don't watch anything. But your tube. We have every channel that you can possible to get. They watch any of it. One of them watch Amazon Prime video and streaming shows. They're not tuning into cable. I don't even think they turn on the box and we have a nobody's running here from this conference to run home and carefully go through the direct mail. Right, right.  And nobody here is clicking a banner ad. Yeah, nobody wants to open an email spam and people here LinkedIn spam everybody but never opened one of their Lincoln spams. And so there's all this stuff that's going on tons of money and energy spent and the reality is it's not reaching the consumer. So how you if you have a marketing executive in this room. What is the message for them? They've taken over this this new this old-school.  This billion-dollar business the responsible for marketing it and the rules have changed on them. What would you say they could do to really Drive brand equity and education become educated and how what is the what's the goal there to me going on the internet and typing in things like how to like literally typing into Google how to start a podcast for a B2B company literally going into Google and saying how to run LinkedIn ads tool and set  In figure contract deals like the amount of things that I've seen happen in the B2B space on SAS companies. I've invested in or GE or sap or clients. I've worked with all of them over index when they act like media and all of them under index when they try to do 1999 B2B marketing like there's like it's unbelievably to to watch people still buy full-page ads in a B2B magazine in a print magazine. That's right, and and it's interesting.  So real quick, I've empathy for these Executives because you know, a lot of them actually know what to do. But the company they work for rewards through their internal scoring the old game but they haven't created metrics how to measure the new game and I keep telling them. Why don't you just measure business results not Impressions. Like literally I had a client. That's a Gary look we just keep doing PR because we have a meeting every quarter and it says we got 47 billion PR  And I laughed because they know I know everybody knows that they got 47 Impressions not 47 billion, but they count all these crazy reporting. So the first thing a very senior marketing executive needs to do is go have a real debate with the board or the CEO about how marketing is measured if it's not being measured by actual business results, you know, we in my business we look at a lot of the media in this space and and have looked at some Acquisitions and the challenge is  That a lot of the these Publications are print-based and the decisions and Freight are happening faster and faster same day next day service, most of the transactions. Most of the tender transactions are within 48 hours. So when these when you go out on print and you print something the market has already moved on You by the time it gets there but there is still a substantial amount of investment in print Publications and those businesses are dying they still the mentality of those organizations is still very pretty.  Centric we hire a writer from a print publication the Legacy front they first it's a culture shock of like wait, I've got to report this is up in 30 minutes and it's just a different world. It's because the movie the news is moving so fast and I just think it's a different paradigm shift. I mean paper newspapers all I think I'd read 60% of newspapers between the next five years are expected to fill because they just can't respond to the digital environment. But you have New Media properties chatter you guys  are are actually doing quite well. Yeah, I mean look, I mean this is just such a fun conversation have them fascinated by people's inability to understand the technology changes our culture like we used to ride horses to get around. We don't anymore.  Yeah, you know like the radio was the number one item in our society boxing and baseball became and horse racing where the major sports in this country because it was a great sport for radio. But then when television came that's where the football Rose because football is a great television sport like things evolve and you know again this notion of holding the past on a pedestal because you understand it or because it's safe is why companies go out of business. So what do you what do you do?  Our business is not freightways but the logistics sector yes is is in many ways under attack by Silicon Valley. It's attacked by Amazon its attack by retailers. It's just constantly The Regulators everybody wants a piece of this massive industry and it's becoming really hot sector. I'm wondering what's the message to a company that that doesn't have Innovation as a core part of their business there. How did they  Respond by letting themselves die, but what do they do? If I don't want to die innovate and how do they do that? What's the secret by looking at the leader of the company in the mirror and see if she or he is capable of innovating everything stems from the top. If you run if you have a company run by somebody who right now is sitting and saying well, I'm retiring in 18 months and I don't give a shit about Innovation. You're in trouble.  For not talented enough to know how to innovate.  Like you don't need a is number one's higher a CMO and say you figure it out, but they don't even know how to judge it. How are you a CEO in 2019 and don't spend a hundred hours to educate yourself on how modern communication works so that you can judge it within your own organization.  Gary I didn't grow up with this stuff. You didn't grow up driving you figured it out. Like I know you didn't grow up with it, but it is your job to it's required of you to know how to run your business and to me how your business markets and communicates is as important as you knowing how to run the finances of your company. It's just that some people don't want to put in the work to get updated on the new platforms and the new world and that's to their Peril. What am I?  Investors on my board when he first invested in the company and our marketing wasn't great. We we sort of evolved and he told me because the most successful companies that are able to raise capital and are able to sort of disrupt it have really strong understanding instincts about marketing and branding is very very important to them and I look at the transportation space and a lot of times the CMO is also the head of cells and their put it in the same person and they seem to me to be very disparate.  All sets a cell shape is quite different and wondering if you could talk about your observations in that. Yeah. I mean, I'm a marketer and a salesperson are fundamentally different with the same objective with different time frames for that objective. Most companies are Market our sales people like they want short-term results and building brand takes a long time and bringing value to a customer with the ability to then monetize three years from then is a totally different.  We'll set them cold calling somebody and getting a sales and and there are people that do both. Listen. I'm very proud that I do both. I've done both my whole life. I like both which is probably why I can see how different they are. I think somebody sitting in the audience who feels like they're both could understand this man, they're different and if you're wondering the other the other ones very foreign, you know salespeople shit on marketers, right because they're like so poofy poofy smoothie stuff. We get stuff done. I mean some money today right those what are they doing?  Does that sign what is that logo like and then marketers make fun of sales people because Nike doesn't sell they built a brand right? And so Intel makes fun of you know, so the two very different things. I don't mind the CMO sitting at the top but she better know both and she better know how to have a leader in each function that triangles up to her and she needs to keep both sectors super accountable for different kpis and they have that empathy and understanding for each other up.  They work together and kpi tied directly into cells. What's the revenue your actions are ready? Yeah, but how one judges that I caught the last part I was getting monk Mike Dunn. You said something that's near and dear to my heart, which is we don't give a crap about our short-term profits were playing long game. So for me, you know, every business I built is in perpetuity. And so as you can imagine the marketer is being judged in a much longer time frame. However, I don't need them like slacking off and like golfing all day like like you  have to keep people accountable profit. Yeah, but but like they're just two very different things and you know, I do think and how fast the world works now a marketer can show a business result within a year, but I won't judge them in the first three and a half quarters, right? I think the difference between sales and marketing is sales if we're using football as an analogy has to put up points in every quarter really to be successful because they can't close the gap in the fourth.  Order marketing can be down 31 nothing and when 34-31 if they did all the right things in the first three quarters at put no poured into the board in queue for the cat.  I like that that's gonna be a clip on LinkedIn. I like it. Well, we just have a few more minutes. Is there anything as this business is this industry goes through massive disruption. You've seen it work out in media and and are seen hit change in media. What is it? You wouldn't know you're not a transportation professionals by trade but you've seen a lot of Industries go through this Evolution. We're at the few sort of compare those two meteorite. I'm not hanging, you know because of Ted and because other things I'm I'm I'm dangerous in my knowledge of what's going  Now because of investors and people reach out to me the coyote deal like I'm flirting with the space Here's what's about to happen? You mean you put it right which is technology and like the world is technology and Innovation are going to eat up every sector it started with the bookstore business Bezos just decided that's what he wanted to do. And if you owned a family bookstore or Regional bookstore or even a global bookstore like borders, it was your turn that happened to be 1997.  I I spoke at the black car and limo conference one year after Uber launched ironically just randomly and my speaking career and I stood on stage and said you guys are looking the whole vibe there was we're going to use City Hall and the government to stop Uber and I said you're naive Innovation always wins. I don't give a shit how much money you're giving to a politician. And so what I would say is what's clearly happened in this business is we are in the kind of  Second quarter of the macro Innovation and money World realizing there's opportunity to innovate because it's there's a lot of mom-and-pop stuff going on a lot of like, you know, tried-and-true stuff that doesn't map the reality of a 20-19 world and I do believe that there's going to be a lot of disruption in this sector more consolidation more money brought in new brands built out of nowhere overnight and I think people need to heed that call like what value are you bringing? Yeah are  You a commodity or you a brand and most people are a commodity and they should be invested in there how they Define their brand and how they differentiate it the number one thing in wrapping up like back the tangible advice. I couldn't couldn't say this more passionately every single person here that is empowered to do so needs to go spend the next hundred days having phone calls having dinner having breakfast having drinks with every one of their customers and they need to listen.  To what they care about and they need to go back to the pad and cook that meal.  That's all I do. I read my comments, you know left and right like, you know, I was just talking with your CMO prepping. You know, you were you guys are wrapping up and she's like, are you always like this on your phone? And I was laughing what I was doing. I was reading comments. Yeah, because the qualitative feedback is the Insight. I need for the next innovation in the amount of people who hope their customers like what they are doing or they're trying to force their customers to like what they want to sell is fascinating for me to watch.  You know II just don't understand how people aren't spending all their time interacting with their customer and figuring out what they need based on that in parallel with where they see the world's going. It's a very fine line right? One of my favorite CEOs is Darin with gr. The CEO of T-Mobile. I've never met him. I think the service sucks no offense to mobile. It's bad Network having it had it but I love the brand. I love John legere because he personally answers text messages. He personally tweets it and he also  You can communicate you. He's a personality and I think he has a very powerful Green. He's built this very powerful brand not only around him, but around this idea that they're they're punching the AT&T and Verizon face. That's right. And there is a huge variable of success for T-Mobile in that Delta against the quality of their product that Stories the best because one thing that I owe the reason I want everybody to go and talk to their clients is because inevitably they're going to fix their product or service.  Service and one thing I always tell people when they hire being a media if I'm in the room or if I'm meeting with an executive. I'm like look what we do. Well is we speed up the process of everybody knowing about you and if your product sucks that only means the World's Gonna know your product sucks faster. So, you know, I love marketing Communications. I think it is the foundation of our society. If you really play out the chest moves of innovation what ends up happening is most things become a  Aditi and Communications and marketing become the Delta and so I there has never been a more important era to understand your marketing and Communications and as we're wrapping up and I see the clock, please stop being a headline reader and start being a practitioner the amount of people here who have power to make calls that make decisions about Facebook or LinkedIn or YouTube or podcasting because they read an article versus the fact that they've actually run an ad or run out.  Ads or if try to execute as remarkable amount of people who come up to me like Gary you love Facebook marketing, but what about Cambridge analytical and I'm like, what about it? The amount of people that have thoughts about Facebook and Cambridge analytic or things of that nature, but I've no idea what it means. You know, I couldn't be more passionate in reminding everybody. This will be the Great era of practitioners not headline readers and everybody's got to Sense on why something doesn't work for them.  This yet, they've never actually done it and that to me is hypocrisy at the highest order. Well, the reason these people are sitting in the room to your point is because we built our brand on social media Facebook LinkedIn Twitter. We figured it out not had zero experience of doing this 0 and we reverse we figured out the model using data and informed information. That's why and to wrap up before I think words matter. I think people because of the way social media grew in our society started as a kid thing.  Sing the word social media throws people off guys. Social media is a slang term for the current state of the internet.  If you think the internet is important, you may want to really understand how to use it for the benefit of what you're trying to accomplish.

spotify:episode:0mH0e9YDgAy1UfeKdBKcws	Patient location location. It's not just a great daytime television program. It is also the theme of this GCSE business part of the episode episode definitely episode. So I enjoy from Seneca and today I am going to be talking through business locations for your GCSE business exam. Let's go a business or firm has to choose a location that provides it with the best environment for it to produce and sell products. Most effectively. There are five one, two, three four.  Or five main factors that influence where business will choose to locate number one is the availability of raw materials how much this matters to a fam depends on what type of Industry it is for manufacturing firms like London Brick Company being close to raw materials, like clay deposits can cut the cost of transporting raw materials. Some firms are less affected by their proximity and availability of raw materials access of clay deposits doesn't really matter to Facebook.  Labor nationally location effects wage rates and the level of labor. Skip certain areas are more heavily focused on manufacturing. And so the local Workforce is skilled in manufacturing historically Manchester was very strong and Manufacturing and London has a large pool of software development labor in big cities. The rage wage rate is usually higher than in rural towns labor International labor costs vary are different from country to Country.  She's such as Sweden and Norway their minimum wage is very high compared to countries like China and India. This is one reason, why lots of companies like Primark and night set up production plant in developing countries, like Bangladesh competition being near to competitors means that it is easier to find skilled workers because they are already local suppliers. And there is already demand for this type of Labor this partly explains why we see lots of similar businesses very close together in cities or on the edge of a busy town in Canary Wharf there are lots of backs.  But please Goldman Sachs JP Morgan and on the edge of towns are often lots of garages or car spare parts firms or rent rent also varies a lot between different pieces renting floor space on a main High Street in London will be very expensive relative to renting for space in a smaller town like Keswick, which is in the Lake District if you're wondering location of the markets how important is it to be located close to the market depends on the type of business that is running a high Street.  Chao store like Topshop will be more willing to spend extra money to be located in a shopping mall and buy into relatively inexpensive in the center of a city. Like no nauseam. Sorry, it was relatively expensive not inexpensive and tops up want to do this because accessing a lot of customers is important.  So what are those five factors that can influence a business has chosen location? They are availability of raw materials cost of Labor composition rent and location of the market five really important factors. Now, we need to also talk about the nature of business activity. So Amazon is an e-commerce form if deliveries can be made nationally or even internationally the company's location may be less important. This means that Amazon is more likely to rent out cheap.  out-of-town space unlike Zara which may choose Prime retail space in the city centre price competition Aldi competes with other supermarkets based on price because of this it tends to choose out of town spaces for its stores because the rent is cheaper low labor costs and Manufacturing firm is more likely to want to be located in areas with lower labor costs to allow it to complete to compete with the competition on price Sports Direct has lots of operations in Derbyshire partly because local labor is cheaper than places like  London  So I'm going to shout out for companies for you. And I want you to tell me which is most likely to rent a space on a business park on the outskirts of town. Hm misguided Zara Topshop. Now, it's going to be a misguided because an online realtor of clothes so they are going to likely rent space out on the outskirts of town. They don't have a storefront so they don't need a High Street expensive location. So what are some factors that influence a business has chosen location?  Shouldn't you remember that Famous Five its availability of raw materials cost of rent location of Market competition and the cost of Labor. There's go over another case study will talk about Aldi Aldi compete with other supermarkets based on price. So, where is it more likely to choose to have it shops out of town out of town because it is cheaper. Now. Do you remember Topshop? Why a might they pay more to be located in a shopping mall rather than on the outskirts of town in a business park.  It's because it is more accessible for customers more accessible for customers. So that brings us to the end of this episode. I hope it was a useful one. Thank you for joining me and I look forward to joining you on the next episode.

spotify:episode:3xfsGEbH9EFeKdXS17L2XG	robots radio presents  welcome to the outer world show sharing the latest news interesting tips and hidden more about the outer world today. We have a special episode for you a follow-up interview with the streamer to reversal. We talked to him before the game released and now we'll get his insights with the game in his hands. I hope you enjoy the conversation and look for our regularly scheduled episode this Tuesday. Thanks.  Hey there spacers. Welcome back to another special episode. I'm your board approved host Sebastian is our oh and we have another interview for you today with our first returning guest to the show. Tuna versal. Tune. Are you doing that doing? Well Sebastian? Thank you so much for having me on excited to talk more of the outer worlds with you. Yeah. I'm excited too. For those of you who might not have seen we interviewed. Tuna.  Versal back with one of the last episodes before release to get the hype going get his thoughts on the game. So go back and listen to that episode. And now we have you back onto now that you have the game in hand to see your impressions and see how you feel about it. Yeah. Sure. I didn't talk about it with you. Awesome. Awesome Let's uh, let's Dive Right In so you've been playing the game since release. I think you got it right at release and streamed on that first day. What do you think? What just off the bat? What do you think?  So we'll say initially I definitely had some issues streaming it because of the amount of dialogue. I felt like there's so much dialogue is so dialogue heavy, especially when you first start and you make your way on into the beginning of the game is sort of bogged down and as a streamer, I'm the type of ship. It relies on on the big moments to make good Clips to make good comedic opportunities, and I feel like it wasn't  Getting many of those with so much dialogue and in some ways, you know, I liken it to a Final Fantasy game with its. Yeah, every dialogue-driven very very heavy. So initially like I was like gosh can I stream this game? Because there's so much that log in it, right? Yeah. It's almost like do you want to people want to go to Twitch to walk to like read a book or read a story and it's not really what they're going for so I can see that challenge even if you're picking like the funny dialogue or the funny choice is people like really have to be like  Stand and paying attention in order to catch that I can imagine that's frustrating and that was that was pretty hard to start off. We have lurkers, like people can't work because they're going to miss something of the story right hanging on to every piece of dialogue and they want to see the choices is there's no you know the course there's the choices really matter in this game. So lots of dialogue options as well. Yeah, definitely. Do you read the dialogue out loud? Is that does that help at all, or is it kind of just comment on it? So I will do that. I will read my I'll read some of the dialogue back and then I will read the  Choices or at least my choice I would read it back but it was just it was just consistently, you know meeting new people and chatting it up with them basically. So you said at first that was an issue. Did you did it get any better as you played along or did you find a way to make it work or it did so as you know, I'm not sure that's not a spoiler to say like after I got to the ground breaker. There's a mission that on the ground breaker that took you to another planet and from there.  Got a real taste of the combat much more so than what I got from that initial landing on the planet for with Phineas or him something you off and then and there's the combat there with the Marauders and couple of other creatures and things but once I got to the planet from the ground breaker that was sent on I was like, okay, here's some combat here. I'm really getting to use the Tactical time dilation, which is good and and then beyond the ground breaker is when things  he's really really change for me and you get on to another planet and that really opened up the combat options companion abilities running picking the right companion Steven run with yeah. It wasn't until I got off the ground breaker things really started to change for me and I was like, okay, this is a game that I could stream. This is got some great combat. There's some great moments here. Let's keep playing and push through it. Yeah, are you talking about I'll put a spoiler warning at the beginning of the episode but wait are you talking about?  Monarch I am talking about Monarch. Yes. Yeah things things really open up. But as soon as you get past Edgewater, I feel like the first level are the first world. It seems to really open up and give you a lot of options just to where you can go. Yeah, exactly Edgewater. He did have the options a lot of dialogue still an edge water. But yeah, but and the combat sort of you know in the thermo power Planner, yeah. Yeah, but the runs off the  the off the heat from the volcano basically the power plant getting into that still still fill it like the combat that I was looking for. So even after getting through that portion of Edgewater, I still wasn't very sure at that point. Yeah. It's kind of getting you into it's easy you in a little bit giving you one big decision to make and a lot of dialogue lot of World building a few Companions. And then later on like you said Monarch is so combat heavy because you're just going after all these creatures are trying to attack you so I can imagine  First mantis or experience there? Oh, nice. Nice. Did you see I was it just a regular one or is it a queen or well, I call them mommy mantis or and I do sing Our Song like baby shark. Mommy's mommy mantis or maybe mantis or yeah, so lots of the first man to score counter was getting to Monarch on the platform. This not designated to seller Bay. It's on the other side of Stellar Bay. And yeah, there's a couple of mantas are sitting there Mommy. Mommy mantas are sitting there. Oh, yeah.  And trying trying to figure out ways to kill those was a lot of fun. Yeah, you don't want to really mess with her early on when you're a lower level and it could be a real challenge. Yes. Yes, is that Cascadia? Is that the city you landed? It was it was? Yes. Yeah, they like abandoned wild town. So it definitely that's definitely a challenging route to go but it's cool that you took it on and found that combat. Yeah from  On streaming perspective. Are you enjoying the game? Are you like having fun while playing it or is it mostly you'd want to find something that you could stream and have that Community effect while you're playing the game. Yeah, I so I don't play I try not to play too many games off Stream So what I'm streaming is what I playing and okay and for a lot of my viewers like especially when it was early on involves 76 and I was trimming that my viewers are like, oh like we don't want to miss where you picked wherever you left off here today. I was sort of  I've got to this point was like, okay. Well, I can't play this off broadcast because now my viewers expect me to pick up where I left off. Right and that's what I've been doing with this game is I've only been playing it on stream and but I tried I tried to look at it objectively. It's like okay if I wasn't streaming on this would I be enjoying Morris even initially with all the dialogue as like, yeah, I would actually enjoy this more if I weren't shaming if I didn't have an audience to please have him write to entertain or probably enjoyed this a lot more but that has changed now that I've actually got in the combat on Monarch total game changer.  Yeah, for sure. Yeah, and it's must be tough to to know whether to pick up a game or not. If you know that you're going to be streaming it no matter what there might be games out there that you enjoy or would enjoy just playing alone, but knowing that the audience might not it might not be the most appropriate for an audience and Community then you might miss the game entirely. Yeah, and I chose I chose to abstain from watching any game plays that in spoiling for myself. Oh, I didn't fully know. I mean I knew what we  It talked about what you know what I'd read read on various sites, like IGN and other places that have no written lease great write-ups about the game. So it's going on that and going on the comparisons that people were making to the Fallout franchise. I was like, okay if it's like Fallout like I'm in and it is like fall out and it isn't like Fallout. There's there's people are drawing a lot of correlation be Mass Effect, which is game. I have not played. I see a little bit of a Border Lands 3 when I look at the items that are laying  Blowing sort of might be a Borderlands. So I was a little bit disappointed initially. But now that I've sort of pushed through that first part, I am very satisfied with what streaming it and looking for streaming it more. Yeah for sure. Now, let's get a little bit into your playthrough you had mentioned before the game even released that you were looking at. I think like a sneaky character one, but one that is good one that's going to take down the board and try to break that up. Did you stick with that or did you go somewhere completely different?  Ain't I did and I'm trying to stick that playthrough. I consider the alignment chaotic good. So it's like inherently like I try to do good things but my my actions and my methods may not be the most ethical depending on what sort of spectrum you put it on. So I kind of called a Robin Hood character a little bit like Robin Hood like I will do anything to help the marginalize even that means like murder Ste still, you know, yeah sheet whatever lie whatever it takes to about the marginalized.  Got to play the board a little bit. I'll play the board a little bit but and I'm actually in a decent standing with a couple of the corporations right now. So I'm just waiting to take them down from the inside and some way I think. Oh man, I think you mentioned that as well like one of your playthrough as you want to do is kind of that double agent feel so it sounds like you've been in working that in there as well. Yeah. I'm doing it. I'm doing a little bit the double agent right now only because there's certain things that I want and I can't get certain things unless I have good standing with the particular company or Corporation. Right? Right. We got to find you some  in armor armor for your Robin Hood Bill. I know right? Yeah. Yeah. I need some I definitely need some green armor. Definitely definitely have you found anything that's kind of during your streams or during your playthroughs that kind of stuck out to you. Like I know there are a lot of unique weapons. But as of right now, I haven't found I found one in Edgewater that the the Constable has the police officer there and she has the shotgun I found last night that actually works really well for early game. I wasn't  You found anything similar either weapon-wise or War wise story-wise that really like stuck out to you and people kind of appreciated you finding. Yeah. Well, so so that's where I'm at right now. I mean I'm in there's a little Community maybe you can refresh me on what it's a little little Community outside of what kind of Stellar Bates headquartered in Monarch. There's a little settlement out there is it feels very very Western very new videos like Fallbrook. Maybe. Yeah fights Fallbrook is Fallbrook, so I hadn't really found any like Ultra weapons that I  Like this since I am trying to play like that sneaky sniper care in Fallbrook. There was a sniper rifle available there that I am still trying to get it to good standing with a stellar day just so I can even buy that weapon. Oh man. The reason I want the sniper Apples because it has three slots opposed to my I'm using one of the assault rifles right now as a sniper, but I want to decked it out. No with a suppressor with with a better scope and better magazine, and I'm going to level that up, but I'm going to  Arm for bits ride for some bits and level that thing up to the Max and do some one shot killing with it. Oh, yeah get that tanker skill up that way. He can repair and you can you can modify the crap out of it. That sounds awesome. I'm gonna have to go check that out. I need to I need to start making a list of these kind of weapons that are all around because I don't feel like I was being paying enough attention to them in my first playthrough. That's just so much going on. So now I can't wait to like dig in and kind of see what else has to offer from a combat perspective. I focused so heavily on  Male in my first playthrough that there's I haven't really paid attention in the gun. So I need to I really want to dig in and get back to that and the matter weapons are absolutely amazing to there's so many great options for plasma for petroleum interest so many great options for melee. Yeah. No, I I've been fooling around. I fooled around with plasma a lot my first playthrough, but I haven't done too much with like n re and like those other kind of effects that they have so that and the science weapons. I want to I want to break into to have you found.  Those yet and I've had a science weapon yet. I know some viewers and people who have stopped. I'm extremely oh you can get you no one here one there right now. I'm just so heavily focused on building this long range, you know drop that. I haven't really had time to deal with the science weapons or even afford to spend energy going to look for them. Yeah, the the the comedy for when you use that image is pretty high. Aha. There's a couple that make guys float around there's a couple of the shrink ray  so that and I saw last night that there's an achievement actually that if you kill somebody with all the effects of the all the science weapons you get that achievement. So that might be something I'll grind towards at some point. Yeah, like I could see lucky even even sort of having a combo of weapons World. Maybe you like make somebody float but then you take them down another weapon. So a lot of options there for the combat. Yeah. Yeah, it definitely balanced out. It's so story-driven so story heavy, but I don't think the combats lacking in the ways that people were scared. We're a little scared of going into  It now got the the Gunplay is fine. The combat is is great. And and the Tactical time dilation is refreshing. It's a little bit a reminder of bats. But oh, yeah, so it's it's own thing and and the way that they wrote it into the story of how you even can slow time down like it makes sense and it's fine. Yeah. Yeah, it works. It definitely works. So have you seen anything in your playthrough that you isn't quite working for you? I know that the the dialogue can be frustrating when you have an audience, but just for me.  Gameplay perspective. Is there anything that's that's lacking that you're seeing. So this game but this game drew a lot of comparisons to fall out initially and there's no that's a lot of my comparisons come from one of the things that I didn't know I was disappointed with was you know in the Fallout series is like if I see somebody wearing something I can get it and that's not the case in this game. Like you may not get a weapon drop. You may not get you're probably not going to armor drop. So just because you know, you see a Marauder wearing some really cool pieces of armor. It's not necessarily going to drop so that was a little bit  Waiting for me where it's like if I see it, I want it. Let me get it and you can obtain it and that way every single time the dialogue initially was tough to stream but we push through that one disappointing featured the slacking and there's no flashlight and oh, yeah, no dark is dark and it should be dark but you know as a streamer like you want a little bit of that Illumination in Dark Places so that people can even see what you're doing. So no flashlight, so I may say there's like maybe something on mining Helmet or some sort of  Of mining equipment that may have a harsh light but I haven't I haven't seen anything like that II had to look into that could be fake news. I'm not sure but yeah, yeah, no flashlights to illuminate dark areas was disappointing. Yeah going back to the armor that you see that net won't necessarily drop it some it is I found that frustrating as well because it's such a visual game and the color scheme the the aesthetic is so great that you would think that they would have to that it that you'd be able to go and grab that.  And the stuff I read online somewhere that they people are speculating and I don't know if obsidian confirmed that it's a technical issue. They're only a double a studio and they said that it would take that much longer to add that to the game. But maybe maybe that's a patch issue maybe something that could come later. But yeah, and I don't know if that's for sure and I think that was just something I saw on Discord somewhere but it's it's it is a definitely a drawback. It's something that with yeah with so much loot so much collecting you it  think that they'd be kind of it would it would tie into what you see? Yeah. Exactly. Yeah a couple of the issues that I had was I found maybe I'm missing something - a dedicated photo mode. I feel like Photo mode is coming along with these with games like Fallout 76 and you can even get mods for and Fallout 4 to be able to take photos because this game does have a lot of very visually appealing aspects to it. Yeah and having a way to take photographs and and be able to  Those them directly to social media would have been really really awesome. I feel like that's an integration that should be going forward whether it's whether it's through the console or the PC that using and in correlation with the game, there should be a way to take beautiful pictures because it only helps out the exposure of the game and if people are taking pictures like there's a lot of photographers out there that will write video game photography. Yeah. Yeah, and it's like you said, it's a visual game the world's that themselves are beautiful. You just look up in the sky at any given moment.  Moment and it's teacher worth take it for ringed planet above you, you know, exactly. I haven't had that issue so much because on console on PS4 they have the share button. You can just screenshot your ears screen but on PC where I think the majority of people are playing it that's definitely an issue that they're seeing and I'm almost positive that obsidian said that they're going to look into that and try to get a photo mode in there as well. It only makes sense. Like you said, it's such a visually attractive game. Yeah. I mean an Xbox you can take a screenshot, but you're going to get the heads up.  Splay you're going to get all the right things like right like fall 76 where it's like I go into a photo mode and all the heads up display all of your statistics anything that is on the screen while you're playing is gone and you just photo quality that you're looking for and you can even frame it. You could pose it in certain ways. I know a lot of different games Horizon zero Dawn had a really good one as well and gone for those games. So it's possible on the PS4. It's possible on console on a PC. You would think it only would make sense. So promote as well.  Yeah, and that goes that goes for the third person as well. Yeah. Yeah, I understand what they made a first-person it's fine. But yeah, sometimes you want that you get you get if you if you sit idle long enough you do get the third person perspective 360 camera of your character, but nothing dedicated to take a photo right and nothing you can control I I saw on Twitter actually one of our Twitter followers had a mod or found a modern PC that you could break once it goes into that.  You can break it out and kind of angle it and take photos that way but it's nothing already embedded in the game. You'd have to moderate get there. Anything else that you seeing that kind of is draw back at this point. Yeah. This is the the last thing is just something that is missing. I feel are there's no like lethal weapons like grenades or monetary thing. You see mines out in the world, but you can't use them. So there's a couple of instances where like hash. I wish I had a grenade to sort of help to establish my position or or two.  To get a leg up on these particular creatures or enemies that I'm facing. So no lethal weapons like grenades or Minds is a little disappoint. Yeah. Well they broken from the mold of the the follow comparison by a lot of different ways and a lot of good ways. There are some things that follow and the the Bethesda model does so well that you would think that they would have Incorporated such as mine such as grenades. I'm disappointed that you can't even disarm mines. So you just have to completely avoid them somehow or shoot them.  It's good. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, you can't shoot them. I think so or okay, maybe I should be doing stuff on him. Like I do all the time. That's what I'm doing. So my guys crippled half the time it's been it's been a really rough play through. All right, sweet. We're going to go into kind of like our last section, which is just like some quick fire questions. We like to do this with a lot of our guests. We didn't get a chance to do it last time because the game wasn't even out but I think we'll do it this time around. Did you have any last thoughts though before we get?  Into that. No. Yeah, you did a great job covering it. I have a as want this to sort of sort of summarize my feelings about it is it was a slow start? It's picking up and I'm ready to get back out there and grind and look for some good loot and get through this story. Yeah, we'll definitely have to keep an eye on your your feed to see if you can get that long range weapon in a place that you're comfortable with. Oh, yeah. All right. So our last section is what we're calling quick questions. I'm going to give you a bunch of questions.  So your preferences and you just say the first thing that comes to mind the first answer and we'll go from there. Sure. Let's do it. Awesome. Let's go. So, we'll start off nice and easy Phineas or the board.  Oh, could you repeat that again? Sorry. Oh, I'm sorry Phineas or the board Phineas Phineas the good guy the Robin Hood. Yeah, what's the best Corporation so far in the game as water? Yeah space with Choice. Yes. Mr. Schwartz in Edgewater. Yeah. Yeah, that's it is that's it's a fan favorite right now. If you have you have to live in one location within the game that you made it to so far. What would it be monarch?  Oh, really? Oh nice. It's been the most visually appealing and and I like the people and the Aesthetics of the architecture there. Nice. Nice. I don't know if you've made it this far. So let me know if you haven't but monarchs dollar Industries or the iconoclast. Okay. Have you made it? Those are two different groups? I don't know if you made if you have it, it's cool. Yeah, I was I would have to probably side with with the Stellar Bay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah Monarch so nice.  I'm on our celery. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. If you have two strand one companion on a desert island easy. Who's it gonna be Ellie? Wait, really? Uh, oh no. All right. We gotta dig into that one. Why are you standing out will say the most random awkward things at the wrong time. So as soon as I got a chance to kick her back to the ship she is like kick back of the ship. She's like we're talking to this lady and on Monarch.  And that getting some getting some some pills for yoga. Yeah and like she's like and and and the pharmacist is saying something that really does pipes in like whiskey helps to I'm like, what do you do l a way? That doesn't even like belong here. Like what are you talking about? So she made a couple of other comments on my Kelly your you gotta the quips are so funny, but when they don't really hit it's just like what are you talking shut up? Well, you're making these done. It's like so yeah.  Took her place in my companions. Oh, nice see running nyoka and who else I am running? Yo camper body right now. Oh nice. Yeah. I was I'm mostly Ellie and poverty. So I kind of It kind of hits hard that you don't you're not you're not a fan of Ellie, but I like she was in all the she was in all the trailers all the marketing for it. So like yeah, I was surprised at how absentminded and that she ended up being kind of like a  Kind of kind of doesn't care about anything very aloof a little bit Spacey. Yeah little bit socially awkward and not really in tune with what's going on a lot of times. Yeah. I like pairing her with poverty though because their interactions are just she just corrupts poverty the entire time. I'm sure the Ellie has a maybe she has a good companion ability, but I haven't been able to see it yet. Yeah the kind of pistol the quickfire is it's okay. It's as when I was a melee build it was really helpful.  Because she's long-range. She would take it from back there and I dive right in head first so that I liked but it's my guess for me. It's it's own on forgetting his name who you pick up on ground breaker breaker Felix Felix. That's it. So I was I went I did a board running Felix wouldn't talk to me by the end of it. He was so pissed off on everything. I did I couldn't take him with me here.  Like was just complaining the whole time. So I ended up in the Moon Man helmet on him and sending a massage to have a couple of companions just running our movement helmets on to you. That's it. Yeah, you gotta do it with me man running around taking over. All right one last that wasn't such a quick question. But well, that's fine one last one that we have and this one's easiest one. What would you want to promote the stream anything else? You got? Feel free to where can we find you? Okay. Yeah, so so you can find me a course on  switch it switch that TV 4/2 Universal t o ni V ER sa L. It's Universal on Twitter. Tuna versal TV on Instagram and Facebook and on YouTube if you just search tune box or Universal, you should find me on there as well. Awesome. Yeah, and everybody who's listening all my listeners. It's so worth it follow to Nantes which you're always posting Clips to Twitter as well. I think I saw that interaction with Ellie on Twitter. I was dying laughing about it the other day. It's it's always  While time and the community is great and you just have an awesome entertaining show. So yeah anytime you appreciate that. Yeah, no problem. Anytime. You want to come back on you're more than welcome. It was great having you on today. Awesome baby will do it.

spotify:episode:1GwVwtNyg11EMh7xugQms9	Becomes louder he's one-on-one with hands like spins on child's head Shepard was asking this is a clinic. This is Aztec basketball.  What's good as tech fans? It's been a while. There was a holiday break and admittedly I have been away from the microphone and the studio for longer than I had originally planned. All that being said, it's great to be back. I hope everybody had a fun and safe holiday break. I managed to get back to the San Diego area where I grew up. I actually grew up in the Inland Empire.  So probably just lost like 20 listeners there, but it's okay. I grew up in the Inland Empire and I went, you know to see my family my brother still lives with my parents and got to see both my mom and my dad so that was great. I thought about going to the Utah game up at Staples Center. I was pretty close to going but my mom's birthday is actually right around Christmas as a couple days couple days away from Christmas. And so we ended up taking my mom out to a birthday lunch instead of  going to the Utah game because family is important and it all worked out because sometimes it's nice to be in the stadium or not the stadium in the arena and other times it's nice to have your own couch to relax on where you're watching basketball. So it's all good there.  Before we get started. I want to remind everybody to follow like subscribe all the all the you know stuff anchor dot f m / has take break down. You can find it on iTunes. You can find it on Google podcast. You can find me on YouTube. Find me on Twitter all the stuff you guys know the drill.  There's a couple things I want to talk about today before going into the game previews. I don't want to make this too long. But if you've been listening for a while, you know that I can have a tendency to ramble on a little bit the stuff that I want to talk about is mostly stuff that some of it I've pointed out on Twitter but Twitter is so hard to introduce context into what you're trying to say because of the character limit and I don't want to drive it.  Say over Twitter. So a lot of stuff I say for the podcast.  First off. I want to talk about trade Pulliam tray Pulliam has been slowly but surely improving and it's been nice to see I've been kind of thinking that there would be one game where would just kind of start to click? You know, we'd have like this major Breakout game and then after that he would be good and that hasn't happened which for a while was a little bit disappointing because I've been feeling like it should happen, but when you look at the numbers,  Especially the advanced numbers Pi PPM being my favorite is numbers have improved both defensively and offensively he was a major negative on offense to start the season and he has improved in that regard and he's above average on offense and he's even better on defense and the last game against Utah State especially in the first half. I thought he played really well. He looked really good on tape. His numbers were solid. I think was seven points and five assists. So that was awesome.  And I think he's showing the type of progress that debtor gets out of his players. I think Trey Pulliam is the best example of that this year. He's shown that progress and especially come March time. I think he will still be improved from where he's at right now. And that's really encouraging we can talk about the team defense here for a minute.  The team defense has been amazing and I think they're pretty much across the Spectrum like a top 10 or top 15 defense in the nation, which is really exciting for a couple reasons one before the season. I thought defense was going to be the weakness, you know, this team didn't seem to have any good individual Defenders and it's I mean, you can run a good team defense without good individual Defenders because so much  This about communication and positioning and all this other stuff helping each other out so you can have a good defense but it's hard to have a truly great defense unless you have these really good individual Defenders and we had Nathan Mensa down low. So that was always going to be the starting point. But Yanni Wetzel has been really good download there are some metrics that say, he's been even better than Nathan men sub. I wouldn't quite go that far but regardless he's been really good cage.  AJ Fagan has been probably one of the better defenders in the conference, which seems like it's saying a lot especially considering how low I was on his defense to start the season just from what I had seen but he's finding ways to impact games when his scoring isn't there and a lot of that has been on the defensive end of the ball and watching him hassle Sam marrow. It wasn't just him. It was combination of him and Malachi Flynn and Adam Seiko, but the most impressive plays I saw in San Merrill  Came from KJ Fagan. And so watching his defense has been truly amazing based off of what I was expecting at the very least. He's KJ Fagan is greatly exceeded expectations. But I mean even aside from that the individual defense has shown up from Fagan from Seco from Matt. Mitchell has been improved on defense you honey. What's only the Mensa but even then I think the team defense  is it's one of the whole is greater than the sum of its parts deals where even with the guys performing well on an individual level the team defense is still Level higher than that and why that's encouraging to me is I mean, it's one of the coaching clichés but defense travels, you know, and what you see a lot of times with these teams that rely on three-point shots like the Aztecs kind to do to a certain extent they can score inside with the best of them also, but  I think when the Aztecs are at their full gear they're hitting those three point shots.  But when that shot leaves, what do you have to fall back on and you'll see teams at the college and at the professional level that when that shot leaves them they have nothing else to go to they don't have an inside game. They don't have a defense that can keep men until their shot comes back. And so the Aztecs playing such exceptional defense will keep them in the game against pretty much any opponent. I haven't I don't watch a lot of the national games. I don't have a lot of time on my  Hands to watch basketball. It's sometimes even hard to watch the San Diego State Games.  But I haven't seen a team either in highlights or in a full game that I've thought this team is way ahead of where San Diego State is especially with San Diego State's defense. So that is absolutely encouraging and raises the floor for this Aztec team a whole lot.  Another thing. This is more quick. Just thought that I had was there was a play it was just one play in the Utah State game where Matt Mitchell drove into the lane and he drew help and he kicked the ball out. I think he kicked it out to Jordan shackle and then shackle hit the three and  It showed to me what it showed was a little bit of development from him as well similar to the train of thinking with Trey Pulliam because Matt Mitchell generally speaking even this year if he gets the ball and he starts dribbling the ball, you know, he's gonna attack pretty much he's he makes his decision on whether he's going to pass pretty early, you know, and that doesn't mean he's a ball hog. That doesn't mean doesn't pass the ball. He's good at moving the ball and switching the sides of the Court.  With the ball being that guy up top, he's good at those things, but when he catches the ball if he starts to dribble a couple times you kind of know he's trying to size his guy up to attack the basket.  And so watching him drive in draw the help and then kick the ball out that to me is probably the next step in his development and that's assuming he can stay as effective and as consistent as he has I think the weight loss has really helped with that. That was the hope with the weight loss was that it would help with his consistency because he's always been really talented but his consistency especially last year in his sophomore year wasn't very great and this year he has been very consistent. And so if he can add that Dimension not  Even to the point of like a Malachi Flynn, but just adding that one extra thing where if the help comes he can kick it out to somebody else because we have Jordan shackle on the wing. We have Malachi Flint on the wing Yanni can hit the occasional three. They haven't been following yet, but it isn't his history. Same thing with KJ Fagan Adam Seco can hit the three. We have all these perimeter players. And Matt Mitchell is a bowling ball in the paint and you  Can't stop him with one guy and so they're going to need to send two or three guys and that will open up some wide open shots on the perimeter.  The point being I've been really impressed with Matt Mitchell's growth as well.  Okay, I'm jumping around with any without any Rhyme or Reason here. It's just kind of the way my brain works. I apologize for that. Got a couple more things first off.  I'd like I'd like to hear from you guys a little bit just to see if this thought is is valid or if I'm overstepping anything anything of that nature, but  I at the moment think that Malachi Flynn has earned if the season was to end today. He's earned a place on the All-American team. Maybe not the first team maybe the first team. I mean you can make an argument for it, but for sure the second team and at the very least the third team, I think Malachi Flynn should be on one of those lists the main argument for that.   From from my point of view would be that Malachi Flynn as I'm recording. This is ninth in the nation in player impact plus minus and I'm not going to go deep into what player impact plus minus is. I've explained it a couple times. You can find it elsewhere as well. I'll probably explain it later, but he's ninth in the nation right now in this in this metric that is probably the best one we have available to us.  So he's been more impactful than all but eight other players in the nation and before the Utah State game. He was actually ate so he's been in the top ten for a while.  And many of the players above him are also big men Vernon carry from duke is one of the players above him Xavier Tillman from Michigan state is one of the players above him some of the players that are Player of the Year favorites are actually below him like Luka Garza is I think 11th in pi p.m. I can look it up real quick. Luca Garza is yes 11th Peyton Pritchard is 12 and those are a couple  Couple players that are some of the favorites for player of the year Cassius Winston is actually seventh it looks like so he was the preseason Player of the Year favorite and what this shows is Malachi Flynn is is right on that level and on top of that Malachi Flynn is actually point zero six points per 100 possessions behind Cassius Winston right now to be fair. I think Cassius Winston's impact is going to  Continue to raise he you know, he had a rough start to the year with his brother dying at the beginning of the season. This isn't a Michigan State podcast. But the point is right now Malachi Flynn has been playing like a top 10 player in the nation and I think that should be reflected in the All-American teams.  And I don't I mean, I don't know. I want to hear what you guys think and if you agree, let's put this this ability that San Diego State fans have to just Spam like the national media heads just at them and say Malachi Flynn should be an All-American because he's a top 10 player in the country and the numbers support that   So there's my piece on Malachi Flynn. Let me know what you think if that's maybe a little bit too much or if that's not enough or if it's just right. The last thing I want to talk about is I want to get into can Palm a little bit. I mean if you don't want to hear any more about Ken Palm, you can just skip ahead. That's totally fine. The main thing I want to say about Ken Palm is  I've noticed there's a lot of just misunderstanding about what it does. And so when people when I see people that are angry at Ken Palm on Twitter, I get it but you're just I don't think most of them at least are angry for the right reasons. And here's what I mean can Palm when it gives a rank to a team. It's not saying this is the rank the team has earned right now what it's saying is this is  Team, this is the earth. Sorry. This is the rank the system thinks the team will have at the end of the year, which is tricky because so much can happen and so much can change in as we see it does change but that's what it's supposed to be. It's supposed to be a predictive model as opposed to a reflective model. And so when the Aztecs are ranked, I believe right now. Let me look it up real quick as I'm recording this they are ranked 16th in the nation.  What can Palm is saying is San Diego State will finish 16th in the nation as or at the end of the year, which isn't bad. It's less than we think it should be right now. And if you take the the results that they've had so far San Diego State should absolutely be higher than 16th. And that's why in a lot of metrics and ego state is higher than 16th. A lot of these metrics aren't trying to predict the future.  Sure, they're trying to reflect the present. One of my favorite ones that does that is Haslam metrics has a metrics has its own flaws to all systems do but if you want a good reflection of where the team should be right now Haslem metrics is one of my favorites the net the any tea is supposed to be predictive.  Or at least more predictive than the RPI was at the very least.  That being said its flaws are it just gives arbitrary values to winning and losing games and so it reflects your record as well as everything else. Whereas in can Palm the record is totally irrelevant. All that matters is the point spread and how efficient you are in each side of the ball. All that being said despite San Diego State being 16 and Ken palm, and I don't  Tesla metrics pulled up right now. I'm not going to pull it up at last I saw they were sixth the difference between  16 Rank and one rank and can Palm was the same as the difference between six ranking 1 ranked in Haslam metrics. They were both about 10 points per 100 possessions. So they're not that far off. It's just that Ken Palm is predicting right now. Can Palm is predicting San Diego State will finish 16 and 2 in conference and finish with an overall record of 27 and to and so what compromise saying is after it loses those two games San Diego State will be ranked.  16th that's what it's trying to do at least two can Palms credit when you when you do the studies and you look at it about 60% of teams at this point in the season are within 20 spots of where they will finish the season at which is pretty good and there's only about 50 teams out of 353 that will move more than 40 spots. So  at this point  the can Palm is pretty accurate to what the end of the season will be. The only the the major thing can pom gets complained about is that it takes data from last year to help make its projections because intuitively that doesn't make sense and  I agree with that a hundred percent that intuitively it doesn't make sense. But once again when you do the math, it actually helps stabilize those rankings better, which is why in rankings that don't do that. You see a lot more variation after each game. So for example, I'll use the any tea again Utah state was ranked in like the 30s.  A week ago and then they lost to I think they lost to UNLV and they drop like 40 spots after one game because it doesn't have that stabilizing factor of the previous season.  Can Palm disease that stabilizing factor and it just helps keep things a little bit more stable teams as we have seen can absolutely make big changes over the course of time San Diego State has improved like 80 spot since the beginning of the year.  But it's just it's meant to be a stabilizing factor and in about a week or two the previous year's data won't be used at all at this point. The previous year's data is probably adding a game or two to the data. So it's taking 15 and oh from this year and then adding another game or two based off of an algorithm from last year and all this complicated stuff. It's just meant to increase the sample size slightly to make it.  Stable with all that I know talking about Kim poong probably isn't the most entertaining thing but I try to run this channel in a way where I talk about things that I would want to hear if I was a listener and to me knowing how the data works and what it's trying to do is is very important. So the short version is if you want an explanation for why San Diego State is lower in can Palm than it is in other metrics. It's because can Palm is saying this is where San Diego State will be at the end of the year.  There's other metrics are saying this is where San Diego State is right now.  With all that being said, I'm going to stop take a quick break water break and then when I come back, we'll look at the upcoming games for the Aztecs.  Let's take a second and talk about anger. A lot of my followers have known for a while that I've been wanting to do some type of podcast, but for one reason or another it just never worked out. Anchor is helping me change that for one. It's a free place to host your podcast and all that stuff. They have all the tools. You need to edit your podcast. They take care of the distribution for you and you can start to get paid for it right away.  Which is really cool.  If any of my followers want to start their own podcast, you can download the free anchor app on your phone or go to Anchor dot. F m-- to get started. That's ANC hor dot f m    Okay, we're back time to get into some game previews. We got two games this week. We got on the road at Wyoming and then we got home at Boise State which apparently the tickets already sold out for so that's awesome. We'll start with Wyoming Wyoming is not a very good team this year. They're currently ranked 297 in can Palm which last I checked?  It was last in the Mountain West Conference is look it up real quick. Yep last in the Mountain West Conference three spots below San Jose State. So that's a thing. They're not very good. That being said they're playing at home.  Layer me is like 7,000 feet in the air something like that. So altitude will absolutely be a factor. Nathan Mensa is definitely out of this game as is a guaca rope. So some of the bigger Aztec players are out of the game one of them being a starter who before his injury using the method I had used on my last Mountain West wire piece. I think Nathan Mensa was the fifth best player in the conference. So losing him.  Is definitely a big blow if you haven't read that piece yet. Go check it out Mountain West wire been writing for them for couple months now. I think it's nothing super formal. I just kind of right when I feel like it and they post it and it's cool.  Anyway, so missing a couple players couple tall players. Wyoming's average height is bigger than the Aztecs that being said. They only have two players that are six eight or taller. So their average height is due to having more players in the six five six six six seven range the player the Aztecs will need to look out for the most is Hunter. Muldano.  He's I guess Wyoming star player for for lack of a better word. His game is based off of getting to the rim and finishing their and if not finishing then drawing a foul. He's also pretty good at kicking it out to other people to shooters or to ruhlman or Cutters things of that nature.  You ranks a hundred and tenth in the nation in assist rate right now and six then the Mountain West so he's a good passers game is based off of getting to the rim. And so what we will likely see the Aztecs do is just try to wall them off before he even starts his Drive whether that's with one person or if he's starting to get around then having that second person come up and close that Gap a little bit before he can get into the paint because if you make them a jump shooter,  He's not very good. He's he's OK. He's shooting three-point shots. He's at a about 34% But as a as a two-point jump shooter, he's well below average. He's not very efficient. So that will be the key there Wyoming's offense with muldano as their lead guy is not very good. It's ranked 337th right now in can Palm out of 353 teens their defense has  About average drink 266. It's in Ken Palm in can Palm suggested defense? It's actually slightly above average and so  scoring would be in theory the issue but it shouldn't be Wyoming will definitely give San Diego State their best shot. The altitude is in Factor as is the travel because Laramie is hard to get to and Ziegler writes a piece seemingly every year about how the Aztecs tried something new whether they take a private plane to a smaller Airfield in Laramie or whether they land in a bigger city and then try to bust to Laramie. It seems like every year they go.  Laramie something wrong happened. So that will be a thing. The arena will probably be buzzing that being said.  Having the best player on the floor is generally a good predictor of who's going to win a basketball team and San Diego State should probably have the best six or seven players on the floor. So San Diego State should win this. I'm not saying it will be easy because conference games never are but San Diego State should be able to pull this one out for sure.  Moving on to Boise State Boise State might be able to give some serious matchup problems. Now Boise State referencing That Mountain West wire article. I did. Again Boise State had I think two of the top 10 players in the conference and a third one in the top 20, so they have some Talent. I'm kind of surprised that  they're in the spot where they're at the rink 210 and Ken Palm. They're you know, they're a good team but they're not a great team. They're two and two in the conference with losses to Nevada and New Mexico. So those are the teams that you would generally put in there seemed grouping if you were going to tear the Mountain West  The thing that concerns me about Boise state is related to their size at least so they are they have a greater average height than Wyoming does for starters. They similarly to Wyoming. They only have two players that are six eight or taller. One of those players is Derek Alston, though who measures in at six nine and despite being six nine is still a perimeter player. So he's kind of like one of these  Kevin Durant guys who's super tall but plays a lot on the wing Derek Alston can definitely be a matchup problem and he's basically the guy that makes the Boise State offense go and run. He's not the most efficient offensive player on the team. That would be RJ Williams is the most efficient player on the team who checks in at six seven. So some good size there as well and then the other  Her name I think that is important to know is Justinian Jessup who also checks in at six seven. Those are the three names to look out for Boise State is  Above average on both sides of the ball. They're pretty balanced. No side sticks out more than the other but this matchup with Derek Alston, especially with Nathan Mensa being out that moves Yanni to the 5 and Yony has surprised me with his foot speed on defense this year and I think he's been able to keep up with perimeter players pretty well. That would have been nice to have Nathan Down Low and then Ian he's still on the perimeter to check a guy like Derek Alston.  Even if he couldn't a hundred percent keep up with them just make him work a little bit and then run them into Nathan type of thing. But with you oniy playing Center, it will probably be somebody like Matt Mitchell on Derek Alston and Mitchell has the the the strength to come back with Derek Alston, I would think but Derek Austin is three inches on him and probably even more so with his wingspan. He looks to me like a pretty long guy. So Derek Austin might be able to just  Rise over the top and shoot basically.  His his to point jump shots aren't very good. So kind of a similar profile to Hunter. Muldano, Derek. Austin wants to get to the rim and finish. The difference is Derek Alston also has a better three-point shot. And so that's what you got to worry about. You do have to close out on him. And then if you'd if you do if when you do closeout hard he can attack that.  That get to the rim, that's what he really wants to do and just that sizes 6-9 as a little bit worrisome. I do think the Aztecs should still be favored, especially at home. We have seen how the Essex kind of play to their level of competition, which can be a little bit discouraging Boise state is going to bring it because they would love to be the first team to give San Diego State a loss, especially in Viejas. I do remember however many years ago. It was now for years  As five years. I don't remember for sure three years.  Some it wasn't five but three or four years ago when the Aztecs were playing Boise and Boise broke the streak of winning games when you were ahead of five minutes to go. So Boise state has done this type of thing before they're coached by Leon rice who's a good coach. They have some Talent they have some size.  I think they can pose a matchup problem. If I was a betting man, I'd still bet for San Diego State to win, especially with that sold-out crowd at Viejas. But of the two games, this is the one that worries me most which is saying something considering this is the one that's at home without elevation and travel and stuff.  That's what I got and I'll give other other breakdowns and stuff on the day of the game today for me is Tuesday. So tomorrow is the Wyoming Game and Saturday is the Boise State game. So look out on Twitter for me to post the pi PM's of the players and the keys to the game and all that stuff. This has been the Aztec breakdown podcast. Thank you very much for listening.  Remember to find me on YouTube Twitter.  Patreon all the stuff and I will catch you next time Aztec fans. 	After the break I look at Wyoming and Boise State.  
spotify:episode:3BoyYAI1BMQwNJ2EBbJ9rD	Okay, you can we hear me fun. Perfect right on. All right, good stuff roll the intro. Thank you that needed that so that it can do that in editing.    Cool people. Thank you so much for listening in on the first ever episode of Sky High Rock Bottom. This is your host James efficient really happy to have you here today because today we're listening to a conversation. I got to have with film Oscar. Let's is a wonderful man a wonderful husband and father. But today we're talking about how amazing of a Creator he is. You do get to know a little bit about him mainly get to know the ins and outs that highs and lows of feel built out. He started it where he wants it to get and want it to  You know, this is a man who walked into her furniture store looked at a table. He wanted said honey. This is the table I want and he looked at the price tag and said yo, this is a bit too Hefty and said, maybe I can do this on my own. Maybe I can make this so you got some what he learned how to make the table three months later. He found a passion. He never thought he would have had and the business. He never thought he would have started. Hope you enjoyed this podcast if you're someone hoping to start a business in the future.  ER get their service their product their voice their moves out there. Well, today is a great day because you get to hear some advice from Phil some tidbits that we get to talk about that could be very useful and if you're not someone who wants to start a business in the future, we have a very fun conversation and you get to know a wonderful person. So hope you enjoy and if you get to the end of the podcast, thank you so much. Thank you for your support, and if you don't get to the end of the podcast, thank you so much and thank you for your support. I appreciate you all.  enjoy   Thank you for making coffee. No problem. I came in and this guy just said you want coffee. I mean, is that the oh, that's the only way you can actually nowadays introduce someone into your home. Yeah, it's weird. If you don't do that, correct. I didn't even ask if you wanted water just went straight to Coffee coffee. Actually. You don't have a choice. You don't have a choice.  I feel would you like to introduce yourself in any way shape or form? Yeah. I'm I'm not actually that interesting. But my name is Phil Philip for long Phil for sure. Thank you. I am 26. I'm married. I have a child. His name is Ethan. My wife's name is Christina from Sacramento. This is where I was born. Just pretty average guy.  Nothing really special.  I was sitting across the table from you today. Well, let's let's start then I'd like to tell you guys why I chose Phil. I mean Phil is someone that I have gotten to know through the planting and the time at City Bible Church Sacramento. He has been someone that I guess I'd try to work alongside with us and stuff and never I think made it out to help him at all. We're still waiting for you Jay. Yeah.  But that helped me get to know him in a way that like, I mean just a little bit get to talk to him. But over time through any conversation we have in person. I mean Phil is a guy who can create a smile from anyone anytime any moment. I know that's you. That's your brother's this guy is one of the most he spent so much time musically, correct. So tell us something about that. Yeah. I was raised in a family that just loves to sing music is a big part of life.  Started playing saxophone when I was a teenager. I was forced into that. I took music theory. I didn't really enjoy that and then I was driving with my brother one day and he was like, hey, I think you should I think you should pick up the bass guitar and I don't know why that stuck with me. Shout out to Alex, but I didn't next day. I went out to Guitar Center and I bought myself a base. So sorry. I was 15.  So I went out and bought like a cheap Squier and I just started learning more about music and it was it wasn't anything that anybody had to like no one had to force me to do it. I really enjoyed doing it myself. So that's kind of where my first hobby. Like, that's my first hobby that I actually picked up and then from there I started making music on a computer and just kind of experimenting and then started playing in church and then  Churches, and then I started playing with a band. So a lot of just live band experience Home music experiments. So yeah, I love music right on. I mean how else are you able to take that talent and take that time that you've invested in music outside of church outside of your personal life. How else do you use those skills? Well, a lot of what I've learned in like  I don't want to call it music production because I'm not liking Studio engineer anything but I've messed around enough with hardware and software to be able to to troubleshoot things and I think on a technical level it's helped with like thinking logically. Why isn't this working? Let's check the cables. Let's check this. Let's check the driver. So in general music and like working through that stuff has helped me develop that kind of thinking so I actually now that  That's a great transition into my my career. I actually work for Apple in a group called Creative Media. Yeah, and that's what we do. We work with logic pro grojband those types of applications and I support them. However, how has how long have you worked at Apple for now now it's been I think close to work coming up on four years enjoying it, you know, some days are hard. But yeah overall. I do enjoy. It's a great company to work for. Yes.  It's good and we were talking earlier before the we started recording that you don't work the entire week. Which well my schedule is I do for by tense. So I work four days 10 hours a day. So I have three days off nice. Yeah, and that's been able to benefit you with what you've what we're talking about here. They'll build these transitions. I mean go man, I would just I really want to get into it. I love I love  Your ability to be able to take just that free time that you have. I mean some would consider that your time to sit on the couch. Yeah, but you my man has started something that I myself have been very interested in have been following along since the Box lamp as I was it would say the Box lamp is when you that was like your first big product. No, not at all. No, no. Okay. No, I actually started woodworking before I was working at Apple. So I was I was woodworking.  Even before we got married, that's that's when this product the table that we're sitting at now is the first project well and this happened before Christina and I were married. So in 2015, we got married. Yes, and I started this build like six months before that. Wow. Yeah, but yeah, it's it's still came from days off. So like I was at the time I was working at Intel and I had a lot I was behind a computer all day.  And I I just was interested in Furniture building not because I wanted to but because of necessity. I knew we were going to get married and we were looking for furniture and I didn't want to settle for something from like, you know, Walmart or Ikea I wanted something nice. So we went to the mall and we went into cratenbarrel thinking we could afford it and I looked at the table and I was like, that's beautiful and then I looked at the  Rice, and then we left so that's kind of how that started. I was like, okay, I want something nice, but I think I could build it. Yeah, so I that's why I started doing research about you know would and it wasn't something that I was like dude. Let's go do this and I went and bought would I actually this was one of the first times that I did a lot of research before jumping into it because it was unknown to me like music I did that for a really long time and I felt comfortable with it, but this is like, okay we're going  You Furniture. It's a very uncomfortable and I was like, it seems like I like pretty you know, yeah standard but like let's just make sure I understand how to do this. So I just spent hours behind that computer sometimes at my work just kind of reading articles. Don't worry. I still did work. But until yeah, okay. Yeah. I I used very basic tools. So I didn't have a lot. I didn't have a table saw all I used was a circular saw Christina at the time my fiance  They got me some chisels. Yeah that she bought me some chisels, which is Christina. Yeah. Okay. I had those I had a router and then a couple of other basic tools. I did not have a lot so it took me three months to build but once I was completed I was very surprised. I thought it would be uglier than it is now and I still see all the imperfections in there. But like I look at it and I think like okay I can do this I built this with minimum tools. Yeah. I'm interested in.  Now I love the process. I loved seeing a bunch of boards link somewhere turn into a functional piece of furniture that I now have, you know something that could have costed you. Yeah. Well then four digits. Well, it's it's it's Walnut. So yeah, that's where the research came in. I didn't want just the basic table. So I bought Walnut which is actually a really pricey would so so every come at it every cut matter. Yeah, but it was still it turned out to still be expensive. It was like five hundred dollars in just materials. Yeah, and I would  That's shocked me because I was like, okay if I'm building it myself. It's going to be super cheap. Yeah, and then I love the look of this but then once I started I was like I committed I started building it and I was like, all right, I got to finish it. So yeah, then you see why does that so much Furniture break so fast. Oh, yeah by then how you could buy for so cheap? Yeah. Yeah because it's not made well, so yeah from there it kind of took off and yeah started investing more time into learning more about it. Just reading more and then  Started going on Craigslist and picking up a second hand tools. I bought my table saw that I still currently have it's my main table saw great table saw but I found it for $250 on Craigslist. Yes, like I was looking for deals just because I didn't have a garage. First of all I was living in an apartment. So I was storing all this at my parents. Yeah says I was like, okay, I'm not gonna buy huge machines. So I was looking on Craigslist for different tools and started slowly collecting. It's like maybe one tool every three months just kind of  of getting there and started experimenting fixing them up and developing skills, I guess. So how many hours do you currently spend a week?  Doing what? She's first started doing over a span of three months for one table your parent's garage. What do you how much time do you spend now in your own garage? Hmm. So I have three days off one day is my Sunday, which I typically spend with family. So I if I do anything in there, it's maybe for an hour or two. It's just maintenance kind of stuff. So the other two days is when I'm in there, so I'm in there from  10 a.m. Up until five or six so okay a good chunk of the day. I'm in there just like a regular workday. I'm in there for both of those days. And then yeah some days after work I come home and I go in there and do some extra work. Yeah. There's a lot of work involved. I couldn't imagine yeah.  Everything you've put out feels as though doesn't need as much improvement. Rather. Maybe you know, what's the next thing? This guy's going to make yeah, you know, yeah, there's a mean there's no a long process to this stuff. Like when I when I just started out it was more about the passion of the art like doing The Woodworking. Yeah, and then as you slowly transition into it, like potentially being a business like in my mind, I never thought I'd be doing this as  Business I always thought like this is cool. I know how to build stuff. That's awesome. But then you get this interest of like wanting to do it more and then people start asking you like. Hey, can you build this and it's like, oh that would be cool if I could make some money on this so you start taking these commissions and now you're kind of looking at okay this this might be turning into a business and then you have to think about those things. Like I need to make this a product. So not only do you have to finish it. You have to take photos of it stage it, you know make it look decent and then you can actually  Make a post about it because if you know, you can take a photo of and it can look like a posting on Craigslist. Yeah. Yeah, that's fine. That's fine. It's still showcase your work but I think having like quality photos and and all that stuff. It takes a lot of time and it's just a part of the process and this is where I would like to bring up the fact that social media or let me know what you how you feel social media has played a factor in your business. Well, it's pressure. It's it's a crowd.  One is looking. Yeah, so it needs to be good. Right and then the more the more pages you follow that you know, I like a lot of architectural stuff and stuff about living spaces just because it kind of inspires a little bit. You want to make a living space look beautiful and you want to add to it. You don't want to be distracting laughing. So it's like you have followers and you have all this inspiration on the social media. You just you're trying to catch up with that witch.  Also be dangerous because I've had days where you know, you look at your own stuff and then you look at someone else's stuff and you compare and it's like you get a little depressed. So it's a great thing but it's also it can also be hard at times. I can see 100% How may be following a page or taking the action to go to someone's page to look through their stuff could bring you motivation or bring you inspiration to create your next product, but also like you said,  Make you feel down about your own stuff. Yeah, as I mean, I'm going to I'm going to go through some of the things you've created some stuff you've built but  As a Creator in your business as social media been the most critical factor in which you decide to create.  I would say it plays a big part, but I know for me that's a no. Yeah two reasons. I believe that there's a lot of stuff out there where things look cool and  People have problems. I think being original sometimes I think social media is dangerous for that because you see something you like you take some time away from it because somehow that thought comes back and you think it's your own idea. Yeah, like similar with comedy like a lot of comedians kind of maybe that's just an excuse that they use but sometimes when someone steals a joke, that's kind of the thing. It's just like a it was you know, it was not conscious. I thought it was my own think so  Same with like social media. It's very dangerous. Like one problem that I have with like Instagram right now is these epoxy River tables? Everybody's doing them because they're so cool and they look cool. But at this point it's like it's done. It's finished. Let it be explained to the low Center exactly what you what epoxy tables and why it's basically two slabs of Live Edge piece that's cut in half and then flipped so that the bark is on the inside and then people poor like a resin and it's like  Plastic. Okay, so they look really cool. Yeah, but it's come to this point where everybody's doing that and it's like with social media. You can get a lot of cool ideas, but it's dangerous because you can you can really get stuck in like trying to copy or not even trying to copy you might accidentally copy someone so I think it's important to really think about your designs and think about like, you know has you know, am I am I ripping someone off or am I being original? Is this something that  I think looks good. So there's a lot of modeling involved. Sorry. I'm talking too much about that specific thing. The second thing the reason why I don't think Instagram or social media is super critical to my designs is because I find that I get a lot of inspiration from real life experiences. Yeah, I go to San Francisco with Christina lat and anytime I come from San Francisco. I'm just like burning to to do something like you go into a cool shop.  Shop somewhere like I forget the neighborhood. There's like a row of just awesome shops with like really dope furniture and you look at it. It's like oh my goodness. Why didn't I think of that, you know and you get a lot of these ideas and like just being out and about it. I think it like you need those days. You can't work a hundred percent of the time and not get your creativity from another source. That's the thing about creativity is you're never going to be a hundred percent original because most of everything has already been done.  So you kind of add your own twists and things so you use those things as inspiration, but you try not to be a copycat mean that's huge. How many people want to start something but say that's already been done or I can't do that because this person is doing this or how could I make that indifferent? Anyway, when I was starting this podcast, I mean, I'm late to the game. I'm so late to the game. Right? It's been out like the the wave of podcast is coming up on five years of like just everybody's on everybody's listening to two three podcast today. I myself and like listen to three or  For a day whether I'm working driving doing anything running at the gym and when I decided I want to start a podcast about a year ago. I thought I'd like equipment that were using right now all in a bag just waiting to be used waiting for me to initiate the go just do it. Right like just like you did with your business. I mean you just said, let's do it. You said let's make this something more than what it is right now. Yeah, make this not just a hobby. Let's not make this just something that I like to do on my free time, but something that I can actually utilize to build to make me happy more happy than I am now and  I was doing when I started telling myself to start this podcast everything in my head is like I can't do this. There's so many podcasts out there. Everybody's doing it and what am I going to be that's different and that's when I realized I mean, I think I saw something on Instagram for sure that I think is either Gary V or something like that that got me to think. Hey, it's not about being completely original because like you just said everything's been basically a hundred percent done. Once you get the idea 30 is probably most likely had been done. How could you make it different even in the slightest way? I guess the listener to go. Hey, I'm gonna come back to that.  Yeah, getting started is the hardest man. Yeah, you like you have this fear of like well, yeah, just like you said like well who's going to even look at it? He's gonna listen but just get started if you want to do it just do it and then just keep working at it. Yeah and go all in every single to all in every single time because if you if I get discouraged, let's say after this or after something else that I do if I don't go all in the next time, there's no way he's going to come out better than it did the first time so I need to go all and every single time. Yeah persistence. Yeah.  So social media is not your biggest factor in what you create, which is same first could be the factor for a lot of people and I understand as a Creator Furniture if some if something is huge it's going to be everywhere. So there's no way something everybody's doing can be motivated to for your next creation because it's not gonna be on there. It's gonna be in your life. That's awesome. Because I think that a lot of people don't know that the problem isn't wanting to be like everyone else everyone wants to be like everyone else on media if they're not conscious about it because  Scared of being different so that's awesome. Yeah, it's important to step back because so like don't get me wrong Pinterest and Instagram and all these different Outlets like great sources, but you can you know, you can get stuck in seeing the same stuff over and over and yeah work on developing your own stuff.  I'd like to get into your Sky High in your rock bottom. Mmm. So, let's start off with your Sky High.  What do you hope to get from Phil built?  In the future that you haven't I mean, of course that you haven't gotten to know. What is your Sky High for the business potential Sky High.  Well, I've actually been thinking about that more lately like where I want Phil built to be. Yeah, and it actually started after Ethan was born. He's three months old now and I realized how much I work. I'd have my full time job 40 hours a week and then I come here and I do my woodworking and I realize how much time away from family that is its it can get really hard. So my like  My goal with this business is to oh, by the way for the listeners hear my shop. So we recently bought a house a little over a year ago and my shop is in my yard. So I've got it is wonderful. It's it's pretty sweet. That's it's one of the selling points of the house for us. It's about a thousand square foot. I've got its own power going there shot by the way, but yeah, so it's right there in my yard. So my goal with  Phil built would to be to be able to run a business and that being my full-time business. Yeah so that I can support our family and but I can I can be home spend time with Ethan. Oh man. That is like the dream. I absolutely  I don't want to say hate but I do I hate being away from family when I have to go to work. I work like 30 miles away from here and it's majority of the day because 10-hour shift + lunch. It's 11 hours. So at leave at 7:00 I come home at about 7:45. So it's like 12 hours that I'm gone and he's asleep before I leave. Yeah, and he's asleep when I come back. So it's really hard for that. So I've really been focusing on, you know, trying to make  make this my career so that I could be home spend more time with family because it I do love the woodworking but at the end of the day if I could turn that into a way to be with my family more that's sky-high eat that sky-high dude. That's awesome. That's awesome. I think you're I mean I would I'm going to assume this but I'm hopefully gonna get it. Yeah back from you, but your wife has been such a  Big role in player in Phil built. What are you talking about? Yes. Yes. Yeah, make sure she's not here. It's pretty evident in your infill built-in stereo in your in your Instagram. I mean that is just social media, but I would like to know straight from you.  How much of an impact your wife has made on your because you are you bought this home together? Yeah, you have your shop and she's been with you since before this home. Yeah for even the business you guys have a kid together now. Yeah and life is so different than it was when you met her. Yeah, but Phil built has been there for pretty long throughout that. Yeah. So tell us a little bit about our impact. Oh, yeah, so she's super supportive. So she she loved the first project that I did and she the  Sit down. Yeah table our studio and she was like she was excited because I made it and it's going to be in our family. So she she really like that aspect of it. But then the more I started getting into woodworking super supportive. She never you know, I was like Hey, I'm going to buy a table saw she's never like no don't do that. Yeah, it was always like oh cool. That's awesome. So she always supported me in that way. And then the the hard stuff started happening when I had to go like again, we lived in an apartment which is in  Mentos and my parents live in rock than which is about 20 miles away from there. So on my days off, I would actually leave our house. So I wasn't at home on our days off. I'd go to my parents house and I'd would work for majority of the day so that that was hard but she was loving and supporting in that and she she thought it was cool that I can do that and then  In general with when you're married, you have to talk about finances and and sharing that stuff and she she would you know, give me that space for me to go in and you know, make sure I can purchase tools. So like yeah, it was never like suppose, you know, we could use that money elsewhere. I was always like hey, that's cool. You know you like to do this go get some tools. So like not that I, you know, it's not like a I needed to get permission thing, but it's just she instead of me.  Having to request permission like that. It was like dude, this is awesome. You should do it and it was is more of an encouraging step. So let's be real. It was just the financial move. She is a good investment. She's found out after the fact so I also yeah, I already had the receipt and I was like, yeah, this is what happened. She's so cool. This is more of a sarcastic cool. Yeah. No, but yeah super loving supporting and then we're looking for a house for a really long time and we didn't think we'd get one with a shop, but we were just looking around.  Different houses and bigger garage would be cool. But then I was kind of looking through houses. And then this one was kind of ugly like like when you just looked at the pages like super ugly in the front, but then I started looking at the pictures and I was like, yeah boring outdated house and then I saw that like that shop in the back and my heart sink. I was like honey, we're gonna leave in the ugliest house wonderful. Wonderful. So now yeah, I proposed the idea and  She you know, we came to look at the place. I don't think the shops told her. I think the room with the big Windows Soldier So, yeah, thank you guys for that for that room. Otherwise, we wouldn't have been with one. Yeah, but it's cool. It's been awesome being able to share my passion for woodworking with her because she also enjoys the projects that I that I make she's very supportive in that and I always when I'm working on a project I'll actually show you later. I have like project scattered throughout the house.  I'm in the middle of a project. I'll bring it inside the house and have her look at it. Yeah, like what do you think? Yeah, you should give me her honest feedback, which is great because you know 50k. Yeah, I'm not the only one looking at it. It's always helpful to have a fresh pair of eyes on something. So yeah, so you biggest fan biggest investor and your biggest is that yeah. That's awesome. I mean and I mean with you with your the new child the newborn. Yeah, he's also an investor. Yeah for sure.  So I think it's amazing to see how not only has your is your sky-high your family and you to be happy at the time together be able to use fill built as your primary source of income. But also your wife be clear. It's not there yet. I'm not just on my printer. I mean, that's just sky-high. That's realistic. Yeah, that's that's the goal. Yeah. Yeah. Just trying to work up to it. Yeah.  I did want to hit on something about Phil built the tables. I have it in all caps with acclamation for it at the end. It's like your biggest thing. It's a you spend the most time making tables, correct? Yeah. Yeah. And yeah, I mean it was your first thing that you created and it's still something huge you went from I mean the these have wooden legs and now you have steal bases. Yeah, tell us a little bit about that. I would like to I'm just I'm interested in. How was are you holding it or someone else welding?  It what's happening someone else was welding them. So I'm currently learning how to weld have a welder. I've done a few things my shop. But yeah, I just said like basic wood tables just with would legs and then this guy Dima. I don't know like I think he's just he's just a guy from Sacramento that like somehow we know each other like we have friends that are mutual friends and he hit me up on the music it's hard.  To be connected so he hit me up and he was like Hey like your stuff let's call it. Let's go lab and I was like, yeah, let's do it. Let's collaborate. So we met up I met up with him at a coffee shop and we talked about what kind of a project we would start so we decided to be something very basic coffee table and I can yeah, I was like heck yeah, dude, let's do it. So came up with the design sent it over worked a little with him.  On it. I went over to the shop. I watched him do it. I did some filming of it and it came out. So I took the metal I painted it. I'd built the tabletop for it. Yeah, and then I threw it up and that was actually a coffee table that I took to my West Elm pop up and from that that actually that table helped me get a job where I had to build two two more of those tables and then a large like farmhouse table. That was like a bar bar height. Yeah, and that was also  Metal base. So from that one little collaboration like experimental thing. Like, hey, let's see what we can make we got a job and he worked on it with me. Yeah and like we got to work together and then we've done a few projects together since so yeah. It's been cool to work with other local artists. Yeah. That's that's that's one of the best things about I would say when I look at a small business growing your bility to collaborate with other small businesses or another Creator in your city locally.  Can give you a huge bump in the industry. Hmm help you create a connections around the city that West Elm pop-up. How did that happen?   I'm trying to remember I don't even know. Oh, we would so mean Christina. We went to a West Elm and I saw there's a little corner where they have a local section of loped like local creators. Yeah, so I asked the management about it. I was like Hey, how do I do I do something like this and they're like, oh, you know well contact this person through email send a portfolio of your work and we'll do a pop-up. Yeah pop-up shop. So I emailed them. They're like cool. Let's do it. We set a date.  Then it was like a month away. So I had to like crank out a bunch of stuff. I did cutting boards. I carved out spoons and utensils. Yeah, those are awesome guns and stuff and then I brought that table with me. So I got to Showcase some of my stuff and I got to sell some stuff there too. So it was it was a really fun experience and it was pretty cool. Yeah, it's funny because when I was thinking in my head West Elm, wow, Bob, that's awesome. That's huge and just asking you now the ability to be able to email  tell someone if your work shows for you know, how hard you've been working and you want that pop up your portfolio showed it and you made those everything you want, you know for the pop-up. It's it's I think a might be encouraging to some Linda listeners. It's not as difficult to be seen in your city locally at places like West Elm if you put in the work, yeah, and I'm no master at like getting jobs or anything but like it really is just that it's a it's  It's just reaching out like yeah, you just need to you know hit people up. See what's going on. See if you can fish up some opportunities because if you if you just wait for them, there are occasions where someone will contact you and say hey, can you do this and it's like, oh cool great. I didn't have to do anything. But then for those like for those jobs where you want to wear when you want to start building something. I think it's important to share yourself or Market yourself. And that's one of the hardest things about turning a hobby.  Into a business is you have to start learning how to do that stuff. It doesn't just come and that doesn't let people go for years in college to do. Yeah, and I wish I wish I had more experience and I wish I did some school for this but like yeah, that's the hard part. It's like how do you turn a hobby into a business? And it's I'm still learning a lot. I'm I've been working with a lot of people and like I have a couple mentors in The Woodworking business that I'm you know, ask questions all the time that's important mentors.  Mentors a few if you don't have anybody you should connect with someone that is better than you. Yeah and learn from them because it's super important. I actually I followed this guy from Sacramento Stephen tiller. He's a great artist in Sacramento and he builds furniture for pretty much everywhere in Sacramento. That's the person you collabed with with them Faria. Correct? No, no, that's that's different. So he was working so he he was working on decent Bounty and  he was looking for help because it's a huge project. There's a lot of tables he did custom stools for them. So he threw up on Instagram that he's looking for help. I was like dude. I follow this guy. I'm like, I'm I want to learn. Yes. I went over I interviewed with him. I told him I'd sweep the floors for free like I don't care. I just want to be around you. Wow. So yeah, he he hired me on for the summer. So I kind of did like a little internship with him. That's I consider it that because I got to learn a lot but  Yeah, I got to learn from him. I worked with him very closely and that was quite an experience. And now he's a good friend of mine. He hits me up when he needs help and I asked him questions all the time. So he's one of my mentors and I think it's important to have someone like that just because you're you're very slow when you learn at your own pace, but there are people that just do do better than you and that's okay. You just use instead of looking at that with Envy take it as a thing of like, okay. What can I learn from?  From this yes, because they're obviously doing great, you know, so yeah, it's cool. One of the biggest things when you're trying to start something new is understanding that you don't know a lot and knowing that there's so much more you could learn at every single stage in your life. Oh, yeah. I mean, I remember watching dr. Phil episode at this teenager who thinks he can rap. Hmm, and he already thinks he's the best rapper so but he's 17. He's no experience, but he doesn't like it's like the total opposite of someone who's extremely open to learning. I've never seen it before and I'm watching this episode.  So it is just a video clip on YouTube and he's I've never seen it before but this kid actually thinks there's nothing more for him to learn his music is trash. So you're just a hater. You're one of the haters bro. That is what he would say. Yeah, I mean it's and and there's obviously you see that he's not going nowhere. So what is the what is the well, I mean how many times have you been on? Dr. Phil? So you've heard of him? I don't think I remember his name, but you can see that.  The key is to success and that's being open to continuous knowledge and learning and so that's awesome that you've taken on a man you've taken on mentors and you've been able to take that freely and openly stayed sweep the floors for free just to be around them. Yeah, and I was serious about that like yeah, you know, if you find something that you're passionate about you'll do anything to like I'm sure for like people that want to work in a kitchen they would probably say dude. I'll wash the dishes. No, sir.  There and it's a great way to get in because people need that kind of like physical help but then that you gain their trust and then they start to teach you things about the trade and it's it's great you get friends that way and but yeah don't be afraid to seek out opportunities Market yourself. That's one of the things that I'm still trying to learn and trying to do that speaking of Faria you brought it up. Yeah. That's how I got the job. I was Mike from church told me. Hey the dude there's  The bakery that's going to be opening up. So I was like dude, I went to their Instagram real quick and I messaged him right then and there was like dude if you guys need anything, I do would work like all the serving boards, whatever. I'll like I'm your guy. Yeah didn't hear anything from them for like three months and then out of nowhere like hey Phil. Remember you reached out to us. We have this project and yeah a month super cool. Yeah three months is just like nothing. I thought like yeah, they're probably like, yeah this guy just trying to get works and you were okay with that because you were just doing you were throwing a stone you were just throwing a  Hook. Yeah to hopefully catch on some just throw a hook out there and see what it does. Yeah, we got the project but we talking about me Christina and deepen our company over here. Yeah. Yeah, we got the project and then kind of from there. I actually started working with the designers that design that place. So everything it kind of it's a ladder from there the designers that design Faria. They're having me help them out with building another place. So there's a  A clothing store in downtown that we're working on currently actually, so it's cool connection on lock. What sound it's just yeah. It's what I said connection locked out a lock. Oh, man. I don't know what that is. He locked it down when I'm saying is you have that connection to hook snatched brought him in line. Now you're yeah, I have a connection because it's huge right you hear a lot of people say how they started as they just message and let they wrote letters and they emailed me emailed emailed until they had  Somebody else say okay. Let's do it. What is the harm of writing a 500 emails? 500 GM's getting one is beautiful. Yeah, only the only thing that can hurt you is that someone's going to report you as spam and your account will get deleted thats. The only bad thing. Is that actually a fear no, no, okay. See I mean, I'm not harassing anybody. Yeah. I mean, I'm sure they get they get a lot of you, you know what I mean? So that's what I that's awesome because when I'm when I look at your feed  When I look at what you're doing, I wonder how is it that he was able to get this connection hearing it now. Hope this I knew any listener listening understands that if they're starting in anything right now if they're hoping to get some kind of piece of advice or they're just interested in doing something new doesn't hurt to throw a hook out. There isn't much on will just throw it again. Yeah. Yeah three months even if you're just interested in something. Yeah. Just text someone be like, hey, can I watch you do this thing? Yeah. You see Natalie. Any I think that's a that's a very big pride thing. I  And sometimes you don't want to reach out you think you already know you had to do it. You really know what you need to do. You really want to get started. But sometimes all you all you really need is just another perspective another 10 20 minutes or an hour of just watching. Yeah, I mean, even me, I mean when I started this podcast I was like I listen to so many podcasts. I know what I'm doing. And then finally I tell Phil. Hey you want to be my first person I talked to and I got so nervous. I like wait. What am I doing to ask him? So it's definitely and that's when I read watch the video for like an hour ago.  Any tips on how to ask questions and how to interview so it never hurts to just do it again. Try it again. Throw a hook out again. Yeah, an extra hour of knowledge and your pleasure to talk to James really say no that is something you feel and we go through the stools Fri was that your idea was that there's if you take and take a look at his fill built page, you can see the schools that he created their blocks of wood. It's Cedar so exterior wood Cedar. Yeah.  That that was actually interesting because maybe for me it's interesting. It sounds actually super boring, but it was just like is actually weeks of emailing the initial design was a little different. It was actually going to be a three parts tool that's glued together and I did like a lot of hunting for the dimensions that they wanted. So those Dimensions they're pretty large. It's like 16 inches wide by 60 inches wide and then it's like 19 inches tall and that's they wanted a really chunky looking stool.  And I couldn't find any wood that I can glue up together that would like be cost effective and that would give them the look went out to different places even a guy that cut his own tree down. One of my friends will I went over to his place? I bought some wood, but I ended up not using it just because it didn't fit. So I was like, okay. Well, I went over to this place that has they Mill they take trees that fall over they rescued. It's called sack something rest.  I can't remember it's linked in my Phil belt. Anyway, they take these donated trees. They slice them up and then they sell them so I went over there and I saw these huge they're huge. They're like eight foot beams that were massive. It's like the size of a tree trunk. Yeah. I was like dude, let's cut those up into chunks and then I pitched the idea to the owner that Faria and he was like, we were back and forth on design because we were like man that so logistically thinking through everything.  It was just like oh those are going to be freaking heavy. How are we going to work with that and then we had to deal with that challenge. We're like, let's reassess some Wheels into them. Yeah. So there's just a lot of like back and forth communication to actually get that design, but I had the place Mill up those pieces. I think there's seven of them. Yeah, and I recessed like three-inch hole through 4th three inch holes into each one of them and mounted some casters that lock and they're elevated 1/4 inch off the ground. So they look like they're kind of floating. Yeah, I mean  Member when I saw them in person, I was like yes, I did. I think I know that's I was like wow, that's awesome. They roll they roll they move around so we were able to accomplish the overall goal and I think they look so cool. Now I could have never planned for that myself. That was a total accident, but it looks super cool original completely. I mean I'm when we walked into my brother's we've never seen something like that, but it's just a stump James. You're pumping me up too much. It's a it's a stump exactly exactly Fair.  Oh, it's just a stump. Yeah used in a way that no one thought of these. It's um, it's a pleasure talking to you Phil because I can just respect the fact that you don't you don't let yourself be influenced by the stuff around you versus just being authentically yourself. It's still do don't get me wrong. I still take tons of ideas from other places. I don't mean to sound like oh, I don't use Instagram has any inspiration. I totally do I just try not to make it my main focus. Yeah, just because like  That like that whole rock-bottom thing actually that I'm assuming we're going to talk about soon. Let's say that's a part of it. Let's hit it. That's more. What have you I've given you some time to think about it. Yeah, would you say you've hit rock bottom yet? All rise like the business side of things and just in general like things have been going pretty well. Like I like I've been slowly building the business. I've got this new shop. I've been working on building that up the  the parts where I wouldn't say that I've liked Hit like rock rock bottom, but there are definitely times where there are challenges in the way and it just it gets frustrating sometimes like I'm very hard on myself when things don't work out and that really affects my work. It's difficult for me to accept that I did a bad job and that has happened before it like sometimes you just do a bad job and you look at it and you're like  I messed up. My timeline is ruined every like this project does not look good. So sometimes you have to redo things. And in those moments, they're small Little Rock Bottom's I wouldn't say I've you know, I'm down then in the in the dumps for like a month because I made a mistake but it's like  During a project you look at it and you're like, how am I going to recover from this? Yeah due next week. Yeah. I've just used up all the materials now. I have to eat it out of my own pocket to go get more materials and fix it and that's that's happened before but you know what? It's like every day is a new day you readjust and you look at it and it's like I don't know my uncle actually he has a good perspective on this. He also does would work and I talked to him and his mentality of any project that he starts his it's easy. Yeah. It's  Just do it. And it's like that's very hard to process sometimes but at the same time you kind of have to have that mentality because when you make a mistake, there is no other option but starting over again and you just have to do it. And yeah, you're gonna have to do it. So it's like either be mad about it all day or you know be upset in the moment for like a little bit. Yeah, look at it. Think about how you can fix it and move on. That's that's actually one of my favorite things about Woodworking and  Building in general is sometimes there's a little challenge attached to it. Yeah, and sometimes when you when you accomplish those little challenges or you work around it to make it work. It's so satisfying. Yeah. Yeah. Oh man. It's I mean you first off let's let's hit back on what you just said that those you just have to take it for a second be mad. Throw some yeah and then move on. Yeah learn from it. Just move on take it take it very well because that's just going to make sure you don't do it again.  I know about that man. I hate mistakes but mistakes are what creates what gave us the ability to see the beauty in something without the mistakes. Everything's planned. I agree. Yeah, you see. Yeah you you're thankful for not making mistakes when you make a mistake and then you actually learn from it. Yeah, that's the bet. That's how I learned most is I make mistakes. Yeah, every project. There's always a mistake. Oh is always well, you have to leave room for because if you don't leave her room for mistake, you're screwed. Yeah, you know, I'm  I'm like, I don't want to be the perfect woodworker make a bunch of people jealous flying. This is all the lies. You've never messed up once everyone not one. I would like to touch on also your what are you there's many things that if someone goes through his website or his page on Instagram Phil built Phi LL be uilt you can see that you go through like you were talking about Wes Tommy had your spoons.  Had the tables the paddles and also you haven't talked about this but you made a good amount of toys from your minimalist kitchen set kiddo. I mean it is wonderful. I'm sure if you've visited the page a you've already seen it and also the camera toy that was awesome. And also the fidgets spinner when to fidget spinner is huge. I remember when he did that I like he's just taking the opportunity to make some money one. That was like a marketing thing. I thought yeah, because fidget Spinners are so like huge so he I was  Like dude, I'm gonna make a video building this thing and I'm going to blow up. This is my ticket. This is my ticket and then I built the thing and I got like a thousand views and I was like, that's not what I do. Now. This is fun to do. I mean you hit some people just maybe not how you wanted it. But no, it's okay from you. Try things from those toys to the spoons to the tables to the paddles the what the the stools the shelves the kitchen set. What is your   What are you looking to do? Let's say in the next year. Well the toys in the kitchen stuff. That was all that was kind of like gifts for nieces and nephews and stuff. So those were just projects. I thought looked cool. So I threw them out but what I'm looking to do is well, I'm kind of slowly getting into doing spaces in downtown so or wherever in Sacramento just working more like commercial stuff. Yeah.  First basis, I think it's cool that I get to be a part of that. Like, you know, Faria was one of one of my big ones and one of my big first ones. I was a beautiful store to I mean, it's awesome. They did a great job. Yeah, like the the bread is amazing. Yeah and like all their pastries are amazing, but it looks cool and I'm so happy that I was able to be a part of that project because like my stuff is there. Yeah. It's a cool feeling. So I'm excited to kind of put more stuff out that exists out where it's not just in my shop or not in someone.  And so on but also I'm excited about you know, building stuff that does go in people's houses like yeah Furniture. Yeah and want to build more tables things that will last I think it's cool to have furniture that you can pass on to family. That's not yeah gonna fall apart. Yeah when you move by the way anything you've heard from Faria Baker to Steve Taylor to fill and anybody else has worked with and I think we've mentioned is on his page linked somewhere on one of his photos tagged. Yeah. Yeah. So if you're if you are Instagram your story is  Is Instagram so that also will be in the information paragraph about this episode from how much you've learned where you're at where your business is at. Do you see yourself hitting your Sky High?  Anytime I mean, do you have a time limit on that or are you just hoping for it to happen? Yeah, or are you just working with it? How does now that's a hard one? That's what we've been discussing. I actually read this book a while ago that I picked up when I just started woodworking it's called when to jump and it's about basically choosing your time to go full in. Yeah all in and it's difficult because you know, we have a home now in the child and Christina isn't working as of right now. Yeah.  So it's been tough to think about just relying on my own business right now the way that it stands right now, but absolutely that's something that I always think about. It's like because there is going to be a time when it might be too late, you know. Yeah here for like four kids. Yeah. Yeah. I'm the only one working there. I think there is an important time when you need to make a decision and try to go all in I just haven't figured that out yet. Don't know if I will.  I love building and I love doing this and I'm working hard at it. So I it's really hard for me to plan out people usually say like what's your five-year plans? You know, and it's that's a very hard question for me because in my head I know exactly what I want it to be. Yeah, but real life kicks in and you know the work that you put in is what you'll get out of it and working full-time in doing these projects on my days off. I  Put in as much as I would like to put in so it's a little bit difficult, but we'll get there. We'll get yeah, and the whole Five-Year Plan, I mean we read in James chapter 4 that well, I want to be clear like yes that I think that you're referring to where it's like don't worry about tomorrow, right? Yeah that I think that might be a little bit different because it is still good to plan out. Yeah for a business side. I think it's still very important to understand where you're going and where you want it to go. Okay, but you're right there is a part to it where it's  Like you can't you can't worry about it. That's where you start to freak out and have like anxiety about what you're doing because like you don't know what's going to happen. You know, that's I think that's that's important to keep in mind this like, you know, I didn't plan on messing up. Yeah having to extend my deadlines but it's happening now just roll with it, but it's you should still plan ahead, which I'm terrible at. Yeah, I'm bad at all of the stuff that we've talked about. I'm so bad at all of it.  Yes business side the marketing side. I'm only learning. I'm not at all. Like don't be listening to me thinking like, oh man Phil thinks he's so great at this. See I'm learning purposes just an experiment. I want people to be listening right now and thinking hey, this is someone who is not perfect at everything is doing doesn't actually know how to Market like the guy who has a degree in a you know what I mean? Like all these things that you're talking about are things that people want to hear. I mean people want to hear that you're successful and in some shape or form without  all the credentials and having all the knowledge behind you because you're taking steps forward even though even if it is our small steps or slow steps. I mean, yeah, some of them are leaps man being able to work with people in the city locally. I'm getting your work out. There is huge especially with how young the businesses. Yeah. It really is. So I'm excited got some cool projects up ahead. It's always working. Yeah. Give me a fill built. Give me a little bit.  Give me a little bit it for the listener. Just so just a little little bit of you to take away with them. From what it could be advice. It could be done about yourself could be some motivation to be a nice little fella only slapper. Okay too much pressure for the funny stuff. So I won't do that. But especially with what I'll leave you with is if you're interested in something that's at all creative were even.  In business-related if your heart isn't in the love of that thing and you're just looking to make money off of it, you're going to have a hard time. Hmm. You can always start a business. That's purely for money. And that's fine. You can do that and people have been very successful in that. Yeah, but when it comes down to things like  Art, you know, whether it's music building Furniture dance dance any of that. You've got to put your your passion. I know that sounds super cliche and generic but like you do have to put your heart into it first. Yeah, that's that's the main thing is like do you love doing this if you don't  Why are you doing it? If it's just to make money you can still do it, but people will see it. It will show ya put your heart into it love what you do and don't have super crazy expectations. Just let it let it happen. Unless your goal is to start a business. Yeah, then you should have expectations. But if you're just starting out and you just want to try something creative to just like go for it and fall in love with the process. Yeah, and don't get me wrong making money is fine.  It's just I want to like I don't want to like have any like very sharp lines like this is how you doing. It's just like for me in my experience feels not a sharp line. I'm looking at just love it. Just yeah fall in love with something by the way. I also think it's very important to have hobbies. Hmm pick up a hobby. If you don't have a hobby pick one up. You never know what you're good at hmm, you know, yeah, I would have never known that I enjoy woodworking this much if I never decided to build this table Yeah, so while and that's where we're at.  At that I never had yeah, thank you so much for coming and not coming but letting me come over and interview. I appreciate you coming on and I'm sure everyone listening does to my pleasure.

spotify:episode:5e7BgPllPnD64KeNHkmr1W	Welcome to the season one reflection episode of One Step. We've made it through one season guys were here. Basically this is going to be a space for us to go deeper together. I'll be looking back at last week's episode. And since this is the final episode of the Season. I'll also be sharing my reaction to season 1 as well as yours, too. I'm your host. Ingrid Nelson and last week on one step. I talked to Erica Anderson who is executive producer for Kara Swisher about her journey to recovery and sobriety. If you didn't get a chance to listen to that interview, make sure to go and check it out on this week's episode. I'm going to be reflecting on my conversation with Erica as well as the entire season as a whole let's get into last week's episode talking to Erica. And yes, Erica is my  girlfriend in case you didn't know and it was really special having her here doing an episode of the podcast. I definitely had butterflies in my stomach and I feel like any time we're in a new situation together particularly if we're in a like professional environment and our paths cross. We just get especially starry-eyed with each other. So it was just sweet having her here too. We actually had a really  Incredible conversation and I am so grateful that Erica chose this space to talk about her sobriety and Recovery because you know, I've known Erica now for over two years. So I've known that this is a part of her life, but it just felt really special that she came here into this space to talk about her experience and there were several things that really  stuck out to me. I think the first thing that comes to mind for me is her view on her sobriety and recovery, and when I asked her, you know is recovery a forever thing for you. She really pulled it back to the present moment and was like, I'm focused on today and doing what I can today and not drinking today and I thought that was such a simple.  And concise answer but it was also really profound to because you know, I've had multiple moments and just things happening in my life where I often will spin out into the future and I think you know having goals is a really great thing. But this goes beyond a goal. It's really Imagining the future in almost and obsessive way where it's pulling me out of the present.  Aunt and I thought it was really wonderful that she reigned it in and was like, I'm only in control of what I do today. And today I am not going to drink so that I thought just made you know, I think longer term goals, whatever they are that made it more digestible for me thinking about it in the sense of what can I do today? That is in  Fine with that goal and every day that's going to look slightly different and that's one of the reasons why I wanted to make this podcast because you know these big changes and shifts and Transformations that we go through in our lives often. We see the end result of that or something near the end result, but we don't really get to see those smaller steps and I think pulling it back to today makes us realize that every day we are.  Are in a small step to our larger goals. Another thing that I thought about and Christina and I were actually just talking about this is how we often just have this like singular image of what an alcoholic looks like or an addict looks like and so much of that is informed through the media that we consume the movies that we watch the TV shows we watch as well.  and typically what we're seeing is this rock bottom where a person is on the streets and they're totally alone and it looks like they have lost everything and that is a very singular image that we have been fed and not to say that that imagery isn't true and that isn't the reality for some people because it very much is  is but I think when we only see a singular image of what something is it makes us think that oh, well, I'm not that so I can't possibly be going through the same thing and I tie this back to my queerness and how I always stuffed away my attraction towards women inside of me because  Is I would see this very narrow image of what lesbians looked like and I thought well, I don't look like that or I don't act like that or I'm not living my life in that way like none of this is really relatable to me in any way whatsoever. So I can't possibly be a lesbian and I think that there's definitely a correlation here and I think that that can be really harmful when we don't see the different paths.  In which these parts of ourselves can play out in various ways. And so I loved hearing Erica's story about, you know, putting down that beer at the concert and that was really liked her moment of okay. I think there's something going on here and then waking up that next morning in her Corner apartment in San Francisco and having another moment of enough this  Where it ends for me that isn't the image that were used to seeing we're not used to seeing the like Sunny apartment. We're not thinking about the person having a really exciting and new and shiny and glamorous job to the outside world. And so in a lot of ways Erica's story is just so polar opposite to what we're used to and I think for me  A just meeting Erica and knowing her it opened up a whole new world for me. When I say that everything that I had thought before was challenged and shattered. It is so true and it was shattered in the best way possible because it made my view of the world and the people in it so much more expansive and I think that is ultimately a beautiful thing. Like it gives me goosebumps to think about that and it came from meeting.  One person. I also really really loved when Erica talked about her. Sobriety being the number one priority in her life because I think as women especially we are brought up to be caretakers for other people and we're often told and even encouraged to put our personal needs aside in order to please other people and the fact that Erica came in here and was like, you're not my  Over one priority Ingrid. My sobriety is that is the number one spot for her. I have so much respect for that because she is putting her well-being first. And in this culture of self love and self care where we're seeing these words thrown around all the time and sometimes the things that are associated with those two phrases can be  Superficial this felt like something so deeply personal and really on a higher plane of existence something that you know is beyond the realm of facemasks. It's something that is very much present in all of her daily experiences, and I thought that that was just so beautiful and it made me think about okay. Well I  I may not be sober but what if I viewed my self care and self-love practice in a similar way. What would be the number one thing for me? And I actually don't know what that thing is. So this is actually a really great question for me to be asking myself and I'm going to be exploring this now probably for at least the next few days possibly weeks maybe even months. Who knows, but I'm really glad  That this question came out of her response because now it's making me want to dig deeper and figure out what is that thing for me? What is the thing? That is the number one priority when it comes to myself care that isn't just about me but touches every single thing in my daily life. So that's my challenge. I've been challenged once again by  Erica Anderson and I think the last thing that really stuck out to me is how remarkable it is that at 13 years old. She knew that she was going to have an unhealthy relationship with alcohol. Even if she didn't have the exact language for it. She didn't know exactly how it would play out. There was something inside of her that told her. Oh, yeah. This is a thing and again like I tie this back to  You my queerness not saying that like my queerness is like a disease, but I think that there are so many things that our child selves are aware of like we know ourselves just instinctually an inherently on this deeper level because we haven't been fully inundated with the broader culture and all of the people in our lives yet. And we do have this acute awareness about ourselves. When were younger.  ER and I often find that the older I get the more I keep revisiting that little girl inside of me and realizing. Oh my God, she was so right about so many things and I knew from a young age that I had an attraction towards girls. I didn't have language around it, but it was something that was just always kind of there and I think that you know, sometimes we can write off our younger.  Elves and not take them seriously and think that they didn't know anything and I think that in some cases our younger selves actually know a lot and we can learn a lot from them. And I think that this example from Erica that really resonated for me, especially in this moment where I feel like I'm revisiting that little girl inside of me and I think it's also a place of healing to to go back and remember those moments.  When I asked Erika, she immediately knew what age like the moment. I think we all have moments like that inside of us that we remember and when we get in touch with those moments, it might be initially painful, but when we learn to have compassion for what was happening when we are healing ourselves in on this journey of healing, I think that one of the biggest things that we can do is go back to our younger.  Olives and thank them for the awareness that they had and the gifts that they have given us and to tap into that. Well of just awesomeness that we often forget about when we get older. So now let's move into reflecting on season 1 of the podcast in general. I just have to say right up front that this has been such a cool experience. It's definitely been a creative.  Out of process there have been learning curves and it's just been really fulfilling and enriching overall. I've really enjoyed putting this podcast together thinking about what the episodes are going to be and reflecting on all of the episodes from this last season. I just feel like wow we did that. That's so cool. So let's go back to the very first two episodes. So I'm going to kind of do these  And pears because we have like the interview episode and then the reflection episode. So the first episode was mommy issues followed by to be a mom or not to be and this was around my conversation with Angela garbs who wrote like a mother. I think that some people were initially surprised that I chose motherhood and Parenthood as the topic that I was entering into this podcast with but I think once people listen to the episode,  Add the response to this episode was so incredible because it didn't matter where people stood in terms of their personal stance on whether or not they want to be a parent. There was something that they were pulling away from the conversation with Angela. You know, I think one of the coolest things that came out of the first two episodes is our first ever podcast club meeting of that we had at the wing in SoHo and it was a group of 10 people in one of the conference rooms.  I was at the wing and it was just so incredible to be with people who had all listened to the podcast who were all there to talk about the first two episodes and I felt like our conversation just flowed and as someone who is an introvert one of the best parts for me was knowing that there were other introverts in the room, but everyone participated more than once and that felt like a real  I'll Victory when you get the introverts in the room to participate not once but more than once I just thought that was so cool. And everybody had a completely different life experience to and it was so cool to hear how the different life experiences informed their perspective on parenting and whether or not they want to be a parent Angela's publisher Harper wave has also been really incredible to us.  A gay bus books to give to everyone who came to the podcast club meeting which was such a wonderful gift. So everyone that came got a copy of Angela's book as well as a sugar in the city lip treatment, which is my collaboration with fresh. So it just felt like a really fun Gathering and as a part of this Gathering I also asked for feedback from the group of people there and Christina and I worked on this together.  Sir, and some of the things that were requested during the podcast club meeting, you know wanting to hear stories that we don't typically here so topics that we may be familiar with but the individual story isn't something that were used to hearing and I think that that is 100% something I am interested in. I think the episode with Erica is a great example.  All of that and I'm excited to see like what we can do more around this General themed episodes around friendship. We're also highly requested and spoiler alert. We are actually already working on this for season 2 and we have a guest confirmed and I'm really excited about who this guest is if you follow things that I'm reading Ben you might know who this person is, but if the topic is  Friendship and there's a book on friendship that I've recently read and you know what it is. Then you'll know who the guest is, but I'm very very excited to talk to this person. And in terms of the podcast Club in general, we will be having two more meetings in New York City before the end of the year. So before everyone kind of breaks for the holidays, we will be planning to more podcast club meetings. So if you're interested in attending I  We encourage you to sign up. We will be posting announcements on our Instagram, which is one step podcast. So that's definitely where you want to be checking to see when our next podcast club meeting will be happening. They're really fun. And it was just cool to see people show up. I mean, the number one fear is nobody's going to show up in the fact that everyone showed up. I was like, well, this is already a success everybody's here and now I'm just excited to continue.  In you this because it really does feel like such a special space where we have the freedom to have these conversations that we may not have in our everyday lives moving into the episode with nittaku Chopra. One of my favorite people just ever she's such a light in this world and her episode was when your body betrays you and the reflection episode was sharing the thing you want to hide the most  When I was talking to knit akka I remember her talking about sharing photos that she had had for 17 years and how she came to that decision and it wasn't this impulse decision because one she had been hiding the photos for 17 years. And so it was something that in a lot of ways she had been doing her own work around and I love how she brought up in the episode the things that we are  Are trying to hide the most in us are usually the things that we've done the most work on like we formed an awareness around the shame that we might have and I just remember sitting there with her and having this brief moment of oh my gosh. I know what the thing I want to hide the most is what she's saying is so true. This is a thing that I have done so much work around if not the most.  Amount of work around and oh my gosh is this going to happen and I just remember looking at netiquette because we were sitting across from each other this thing that I was hiding inside of me this story just felt so big and heavy and scary and hearing nittaku story and looking into her eyes. I had this moment of oh, I think it's going to be okay. I think it's going to be okay because  Nitta has done this and I think it just has to do with netiq has presence to she made me feel like that was a possibility for me and I felt safe in that moment. Just even contemplating it for a second and all of this happened in a split second and then it went away and going into the reflection episode. I had been planning to talk about something else because obviously my brain came into play and was like,  Let's not go there. You don't have to do this. Like it's not totally necessary the people who matter in your life, they all know this story about you like every excuse that I could think of was there. So I had actually planned to talk about something else and then as we started recording I was like, oh my gosh, I feel this story coming up inside of me and I can either deny it and push it down or I can let it come out as it.  wants to come out clearly and my body was actually sending me that signal like this was a physical experience for me and I let it come out and that was another split-second decision where you know, I think about sometimes my life in terms of piggy banks and what I'm investing in and the piggy bank of integrity and honesty or the piggy bank of denial and lying and being  Kind to myself ultimately and betraying myself. So when I thought about it in terms of those two piggy banks, I was like, where do I want to be investing this coin? And I chose the piggy bank of integrity and truth and courage and it was unexpected. So I didn't like have a script or anything laid out, but I told the story of how I lied about graduating from college and  And it was scary. I couldn't believe that it was coming out when it was coming out. It was almost like I was having this out-of-body experience briefly where I was like my mouth is moving and I can't believe these things are coming out. But when I reflect on it now, you know, I realized that that really was the only choice and only path within my Integrity there were other options, of course, but they were either slightly out of my Integrity or way.  Of my integrity and this was something that was looking to come out so much so that I felt it in my body and I'm really grateful that I paid attention to what my body was saying to me because since releasing it I have not felt that same feeling in my body because it's out of me and the conversations that I've had from people after posting that episode I was telling Christina.  Ah this that I had gone into that week that the podcast was going to go up and I was a wreck blessed Christina because I was up and down like very up and down just like emotionally I would have days where I was like great. This is awesome. Like I'm living my truth and then other days where I'm like what the hell am I doing? And I think that's when you know that you're like in a vulnerable space when you're really just like toggling.  Can forth before he like release it from yourself, but I told her that going into that week. I had just been having a conversation about miracles. So someone had presented this idea around Miracles and how Miracles are actually a small thing that can happen in our lives every day. And so I loved that idea and I remember asking for a miracle.  That week and it wasn't a miracle of I'm hoping that people respond to it in this way because I knew that wasn't within my control and one thing that I try to practice is to not try to control outcomes, but to be present and what my actions are. So when I was asking for this miracle, I asked no matter what happens. Please help me to be drenched in love.  What my miracle was I had to think about it for a second because I was like I need to get past like the response from other people. I need to get past these first few layers. What would truly be a miracle for me? And because I carried so much shame around this for so many years the miracle and the antidote to shame is love and the day that podcast went up and the days following I received text messages from people.  people that I know and some that I don't know very well who just poured love into the messages and when I saw people they were so incredibly loving and kind and I was in awe that the miracle happened and the response from you as listeners has also reflected love and you know the letters that we  I have received the messages people sharing their personal stories. Some people even experiencing almost the exact same thing with grief and lying and lying about a degree like to know that there was someone else out there who experienced basically the exact same thing. I thought to myself. Oh my God for all of these years. I thought that I was just completely alone in my  Act Story and there's another person out there at least one other person who has felt this and has experienced this and I freed myself and I think that's my ultimate reflection. I feel like a different person after letting that go I feel like I have really stepped into who I meant to be right now. And who I meant to be right now is someone who is not ashamed of her past and her story. I  For so long it was just ashamed of taking a different path in life and having a life that people around me didn't have whether it was having a sick parent growing up and no one around me having a sick parent or having a parent died when I was younger and I didn't know anyone else who was my age who had lost a parent and then you know, I was in abusive relationships. I was raped and I was going through  A lot of shit. And so the fact that lying and creating a story in my head that seemed safe and predictable and comfortable like that makes sense to me that that would be my coping mechanism because I didn't reach for other things but we all have to reach for something. We all have coping mechanisms and moments of darkness and it's all going to look different for every single one of us and  Is happened to be my coping mechanism. What I've realized now is that I haven't gotten a job because I've said that I have a degree, but actually my career path is a path that I kind of accidentally found that happened to not require a degree and I followed that path and I have let go of that coping mechanism.  And I'm not afraid of my story anymore and that feels like a really really big deal to look at my past self with compassion and to know that there's so much healing that has happened and that I'm proud of myself. Like I couldn't imagine 10 years ago being in this place where I'm like telling the story I've gone to events think it was last week Christina and I were at an event and she was like in  And sentence you mentioned money and dropping out of college and that was amazing to see and I was like, oh my God, I did do that and to just know that that's the place where I'm in now where I'm telling the truth about who I am and I'm going to continue on that path and I'm going to learn more about myself and just have more compassion for my past self. That makes me feel really  Good about all the work that has led me to this point and I'm so grateful to have this space for the podcast because this could have come out in different ways. But the podcast felt like the space where it wanted to come out and I'm glad that I listened to that instinct. Okay. I made it through without crying. Thank God the last two episodes that I'll be reflecting on our money equals lots of feelings with Chelsea Fagan and  Money that changed everything since talking to Chelsea we covered so much but the thing that has really stuck with me the most that I keep thinking about now months after talking to Chelsea is that when you don't own your story people start making assumptions and filling in the blanks for you. I think this especially applies to your financial story because we all make assumptions about  About people whether it's based off of how they present themselves what they're buying what their job is and stepping into transparency around finances in the moments that matter with the people who matter I think is life shifting and I've gotten text messages from people that are like the next time I see you. I really want to talk about this more in person. Like I would really love to hear more from you. I want to share like what my experiences the  This part about that is that ultimately it's people claiming their stories for themselves and taking back that narrative instead of letting other people fill in the blanks. And for a long time. I let other people fill in the blanks of my life for me whether it was what I was expected to do go to college have this job or after starting my career on the internet what I should and shouldn't be  be doing what I should and shouldn't talk about and I'm just kind of done with that from childhood all the way up through my professional years. I have been told not to talk about money. I've been discouraged to talk about money publicly. And now I'm just like I will talk about money when I feel like I want to talk about it and it's the space that I want to do it in because I'm not ashamed of my story and I think  At this episode with Chelsea and then the reflection episode really helped me to dig in deeper to what my financial story is and it's something that I'm still in process with and I'm still learning. I feel like every single day. I'm learning something new but it does feel really powerful to be in this place where I'm owning my financial story and I'm talking about it and I'm talking about it.  It in professional spaces. I'm talking about it with my friends. My friends are sharing their stories with me. You guys are sharing your stories with us that just feels like a big freaking deal. Now. We're going to be moving into your Reflections. Here's what you had to say Ingrid. My name is Rachel and I'm from Michigan and I just finished your episode with Erica about her sobriety adventure and journey and how  You doing in recovery and all of that and I wanted to say that the episode really resonated with me because last night I went to my very first Al-Anon meeting to kind of deal with my own mental health journey in regards to an alcoholic that I love dearly and that's in my life. And I'm on this kind of weird spiritual journey that also just culminated me realizing that I needed some help and attending Al-Anon and so I feel like it was some sort of almost like a divine intervention that  But this is what your episode was about today. And I really appreciate breaking down the stigma around alcoholism and sobriety. I think it's really great. And I really enjoyed your podcast so far. I really can't wait to see what you have in season 2. Hey Ingrid. I honestly it connected with all of your podcast episodes so far, but this one has hit really close to home. It wasn't alcohol, but I had another addiction to drugs specifically marijuana.  Sickly I have been using it since I was in my teens and when I finally came out as gay I kind of used it as a way to cope with how people were going to treat me and the anxiety and the fear that I had that everything would be different and worse. But luckily I met my beautiful girlfriend and you know, she finally said something to me and it wasn't that she was forcing me to quit whatsoever. And she also made that really  Ali clear that if it was something that I wanted to do, you know that there needed to be a different way about going about it and actually doing it and I just kind of needed to hear that to see that I didn't need it and I don't want to do it so it's been a few months of me being sober and I haven't even wanted to try it again or felt the need to do it again. It was almost like a barrier between me and my girlfriend.  And just any emotional connection we could ever feel it was like I had so many things happen, you know, just like personal issues that have happened throughout my life that I was just trying to hide and keep to myself. It just all started to boil over and I just wanted to use any kind of barrier I could so that I wouldn't have those emotions come out and now I'm definitely more emotional, but that also means that I can be closer to my  Friend in our relationship and it also shows me that it's okay to be vulnerable and people still support you no matter what but yeah, I'm just excited for what the future holds for you. Bye. Hi Ingrid sober life is the very first podcast I've ever heard. I know I'm a bit late to the podcast party, but I am so glad I did and now that I'm here I'm here to stay. I had been debating sobriety.  For a while after losing my dad. I felt that alcohol was the only way I could connect with him. It doesn't help the fact that he himself was an alcoholic. It was just a very complex way that I was trying to find some form of grieving or support to alcohol, even though I've had realizations about it. I just never had the courage to act.  Actually act upon it and I can completely relate to Erica being scared of not being able to have a drink again. It's scary but it's been a week that I've been sober. I've made the decision to not drink anymore. Take care of myself. I'm trying to be more present. I've taken of meditation. I've been trying to make the change in my life. I'm trying to do it one step at a time.  Time thank you so much for being a catalyst for that change that I've made. Thank you so much Ingrid and Erica. Hi Ingrid. So I just listened to your podcast about sharing the thing you want to hide most as well as the podcast on so sugar about your friendship with Carrie in both of these episodes. You talked about your relationship with the coping mechanism of lying and I just really really appreciate that. You spoke about that it made  Me realize that I had been doing the same thing and I don't love that. I've been doing that. But I'm so grateful that I know about it now and can start the process of coming out of that and being my most authentic self. I also just want you to know that I love it. You're a queer woman of color that's talking about hard stuff and taking up such a wonderful space and doing everything that you're doing. So I would get lanky talking about the hard stuff and know that it's helping at least one clear girl out.  Here you appreciate you time. Thanks. Hello. My name is Marissa and I'm calling from Ann Arbor Michigan. I just wanted to say that I really enjoyed the first season of the one-step podcast. I just wanted to know if next season occurs. You were going to focus on more queer people whether they're in literature or pop culture just because I know that being part of the LGBT community or self that is an angle that you take with a lot of your content and  As a member of the LGBT community myself, I would really appreciate it. Thanks so much. Bye well, thank you so much for ISSA for calling in. We are definitely planning to make episodes that are more specifically lgbtq focused. I hope that you were able to listen to Erica's episode around her sobriety because we do talk about queerness and sobriety. This is a topic that  is really important to me and I would love to do episodes that are more specifically focused on this topic, but I think one thing that has been really cool about this first season is, you know, the things that we are talking about because I am a mixed race queer woman the things that we're talking about the perspectives I'm sharing are coming through the lens of a  queer experience and I feel really proud of myself for stepping into that space and really grateful to have this space and that makes me really excited to talk to other people about their experiences like having Erica here and talking about queerness and Recovery really like lit up this part of me where I was like who I want to have like more queer conversations with people so  If any of you have suggestions for guests that you would love to hear on the show, definitely let us know. It could be an author that you really love or maybe you just have like a general topic. You would like to have covered. We are open for feedback here. Hi, I'm good. My name is Sandra Kosta and my favorite episode has been the one about finances. I thought it was very honest and  and there are a lot of topics that I haven't heard another podcast about personal finances and all of that that I've heard here and also being part of the LGBT community. It was nice to hear about that as well. Anyway, keep up the good work, and I'm excited to do this. Hey Sandra, thank you so much for calling in. This voice mail has actually inspired me along with the previous one now. My wheels are turning and I'm thinking it would be really cool at some.  Point in the future to do an episode that is specifically around queerness and money because that was something that Chelsea brought up during our talks together and I think it would be really cool to focus in on that because it really isn't something that I have heard a lot about at least not in like one designated spot. I've heard like little tidbits here and there and like  personal experiences from people that I know and of course, I have my personal experiences, but I think it would be really cool to just make a full episode around this so TBD or maybe it's TBC actually to be continued. All right. So now we're going to be moving into questions that we have received in a written form and I'm bringing in Christina. Who is the producer here on one step and she's going to read the questions.  And we're going to answer them together. I thought it would be cool to have you here Christina since you're literally always here sitting next to me. Hi everyone. This is Christina. So our first question and it was actually really appropriate because we wanted to talk about this anyway, but what will season to include so we've been thinking a lot about season two. We definitely have the Friendship episode planned since that was requested and I immediately knew who I wanted to talk to you.  But what are some of the other things we've been discussing a lot of the feedback has been around hearing different paths. For example with Angela's episode hearing different paths to Motherhood other versions of what life can look like and I think that's something that's really interesting to me. So I'd love to have that on that podcast too. Yeah, I agree especially just around like Parenthood alone. There's literally like at least seven different episode idea.  That could just stem off of that topic. We also want to have the community featured heavily in the episodes to we have really enjoyed having that interaction with you. So I would like it if you send the people that you want to be featured because that's a huge part of our process and making this happen. Yeah, definitely and it's really cool to to like hear voice notes and voicemails from people and to hear actual.  All voices because you know, we're putting voice out there but to receive it back feels so special and personal it feels like when we called the person called us. That's so cool. Yeah, to be honest in the beginning. I was like am I gonna have to have my friends call and we have not done that just having your boys on the podcast. All of your voice has been really great. Oh my God.  I'm just thinking about our friends would totally call into if we needed them to okay. So the next question is I want to see the setup of your recording just curious. Okay, so we have actually been recording mostly at the YouTube space in New York. They have a podcast Studio there. But today we are actually recording at the wing in Brooklyn. So after we're finished recording today, we'll take a photo and we'll post it.  It on our Instagram account when this episode goes up. So then you can see what it looks like, but we're actually in a pretty cool room today. It's really cute. Yeah. See the next question is how much money are you making off these podcasts? We are actually in the red on the vodcast because we haven't had any ads running this first season, and we also decided to go in a route where we're not tied to a network. So we fully owned everything and if you're not familiar with like how podcast  Work networks are basically groups of podcasts and often one of the most valuable things about being in a network is that your cross promoted in other podcasts and that gives you more visibility. It usually provide connections with advertisers and facilitate those relationships, but we didn't take that route. You know, I remember talking about this with Christina and I was saying, you know, this is our chance to really  figure out what this podcast is to play with it and then we can work with advertisers in future Seasons, but I think it's actually been really cool having the first season ad-free. We're hoping that in the future we will become profitable but this was something that I was definitely willing to invest in and so I have put my own money into this to support the podcast and also just for transparency when we  Court at the YouTube space that space is free for creators that have 10,000 subscribers or more and I happen to live in New York. So it's within super close proximity. It's really convenient to use their space there. And then today at the wing we had to pay for the recording space and also the equipment and then we also have tongue here who is our amazing audio engineer and we pay her to so  So that's kind of a look into what's happening in terms of the expenses for the podcast. The next question is what's the most difficult thing to do about the entire podcast? I'm gonna let you answer this one first Christina because I feel like you this is your first time doing anything podcast related, right? So I'd say there are a lot of steps that go into making a podcast that may not be immediately obvious like working with the sound and  Here and finding a host for our RSS feed and making sure that every episode makes it all the different platforms so that you can hear it and securing all the amazing guests and I have a lot of experience creating content online, but I've never worked on a podcast before so everything that I'm doing. I'm doing it for the first time. So I would say that for me the most difficult thing is not beating myself up because  Cuz I want it to be really really good and I think Ingrid deserves that I think this community deserves that and so I have really high expectations. But I'm also trying to show myself some Grace to but I really do hope that you love the podcast. Well, I think you're doing an incredible job. I have been saying to people that I know how really incredible it has been for me to see you step into this space and just  Figure it out. And when I listen to the episodes when we're going through the editing process, I am just so impressed with how you have stepped into it. And I think you're doing an amazing job. So you deserve the grace, but you also deserve a lot of praise to because you I mean this first season is even better than I had imagined it. Thank you. Yeah you and the last question is do you regret sharing any of your vote?  Honorable moments. How do you keep life and work separate? Well, I've been on the internet for ten years now. So if I said I didn't have any regrets that would be a lie, because I think any of us who have been on the internet just in general. We definitely I mean just scroll back to your old Instagram photos, and I'm sure you can find some things there. But yeah, I definitely have small.  I can't think of like the smaller ones right off the top of my head right now, but just in general like a bigger regret that I have is sharing intimate and personal life moments that I wouldn't share now today. And so I think that's ultimately the thing about regrets. They are things that we recognize in this point in time.  he would not do and that's why it's a regret if we regret something we've obviously done a lot of learning to get to that point and for me one of the most important things in my life are my relationships with my friends and also my romantic relationship with Erica my relationship with my mom my relationships in general are really big deal to me and what I've learned over the years is that it's often the smaller moments that  That you typically won't see on camera or like in an Instagram photo or like hear me talking about those are the moments that I really cherish the most and I did go through a phase, especially in my early years of just being on the internet and on YouTube where I didn't have any boundaries and I had to figure out what my boundaries were by crossing over them. And then I started realizing. Oh that doesn't actually feel good.  To share that that actually feels like something I want to keep as a part of my private experience and so over time I've learned what feels good for me and what feels like I'm betraying a personal aspect of my life. And I think we all especially now that pretty much everyone is on social media and is connected to the internet. We all owe it to ourselves to  To have a personal life and when I go into sharing moments of my life and my experience or even having Erica on this podcast, there are conversations that happen if I'm sharing something about myself. I talked about it with myself. I write about it. I know why I'm there to share it and my deeper intentions behind it. If someone else is involved, we have like multiple conversations we talk about what  Boundaries are what we will and won't talk about and I think ultimately that's just given me a lot more. Peace and it's interesting how setting boundaries where it's some people I think confused boundaries with like putting up a wall and shutting people out. I've actually noticed that setting boundaries in my life has allowed me to go deeper into my story and my experience is where I'm actually sharing more meaningful and  information when I want to share it and that's what feels good for me. I'm living authentically through my work and I'm living authentically through my personal and private experience as well. Alright, everyone that is going to be it for season one. We're going to wrap it up right here. Thank you so much to everyone who is listening and who has listened to this first season. It has been an absolute.

Not quite right. It didn't occur to you that no not to worry on with the micro. Okay, so Emma says  And I have a creep story that shocks everyone I've ever shared it with. It's a true story a friend of mine lived in holes during her time at Uni in the UK for one of the girls 21st birthdays. They decided to order a stripper and they requested a fireman that night they all sat around the circle waiting for the stripper the doorbell rang at the door stood an older but still hot security guard stripper the girls decided to go with it. He turned out to be a total creep. He had all the girls put their hands down his pants and feel his penis.  Before getting completely naked and posing for photos. They were on a bit traumatized but they paid him the money and he left five minutes a day drills. Doorbell rang, the real stripper arrived. There's COBOL real stripper. He was younger hotter and a fireman as they had requested. Did it happen? The girls told him what happened and he was very sympathetic. He even offered to leave and come back another time to leave and come back another time. They decided to let him do it.  I mean you'd be full to the brim with strippers. But in the end of that nice too much guys, can we just go back to the first one wasn't a stripper. That was a soft. They should have called the police. Yeah, then again, he was sort of asking them to put his and they did it, but they didn't in the cunt. They understood the situation to be one thing man. Got a little rub from every woman in the room and got paid for it also gone.  Garage with each of them. Yes, there must be a follow-up whatever became of so they just so they decided to let that stress that constraint for it to just stare. Awkwardly Buddha bust at the end. Oh, yeah, the identity of the original man remains a complete mystery and then she finishes the messages BTW I have photos proving this might actually happen and then she sent them to you. Yes. Yeah.  So I was like, I mean, you can basically hear me panting in this message back and she says the photos are hilarious concerned. I'm like, oh my God, please. So there's first stripper. Okay, which sorry not actually stripper healthy young man. I was not young not that good underwear at least clean. Very white very white. That's a bleached white wife. He's the semi in that clearly does.  Cassie have you seen  You better be about to show us today my God so funny. I mean for a kind of a visual reference. I think he looks like Rachel Green's died in friends. Yeah, like remember he was quite leathery tange and that age. Yeah, and I did he have music or did you go to me? Was there any other Telltale think I mean did he say she goes number one fake stripper? No props just Underpants and then number two.  Real stripper came with Suds. What the fuck is the second pick is dumb and amazingly weeping soaped up. But he's wearing a towel around his name. He's got kind of a low-hanging towel to capture ayats honest. He's not in a bath. He's standing on the carpet covered in when much much more shapely what you would expect of a stripper enough body shaming. Thank you. Fantastic. I know it's so dark though. The greedy is dark like  YouTube video that's when REO and be like, what did I participate in tell me the circumstances again of which the first stripper arrived to arrive just rang the doorbell. Like how did he know that time is arriving to a gang of women. You think he just that's his Saturday night. It's just traipsing the halls of the University asking did somebody order a stripper and he just struck gold finally finally or he's the receptionist at the book A Stripper.  Business book A Stripper.com and was like, I'll take this one. I think that but he would have really try to look into it. I think they would have find out pretty quick. If it was that they socialist really like no nobody of nobody like that. What Anna the sudsy stripper seems like a sole Trader, you know, true true strips and swords and the fake stripper is feel you're right though Cassie. That's it.  That's a call to the police. So I'm absolutely grateful to the Bieber 21 like but see my defense like my my sort of like coming thought is you know, when you're you say you do you think you've left the keys in the front door or like that car and locked or something. You're like, well, what are the chances that are bad opportunistic person is going to saunter by at that exact moment for the five minutes that I've left the keys in the door and steal them.  Only to later return to rob the place. I'm like the chances of there being those amount of coincidences happen in tandem just are really unlikely. So like the fact that this guy just knocked on the door unlucky found a gaggle of women. He went expecting the he had the he had to be connected to the situation in some way had to be okay. He had to have known that they were they're expecting a stripper the very least agreed to it suspicious.  I think they seriously job Ginger them there couldn't come up with an answer but we now have a photograph of him that should narrow things down. Okay. Anyway, what are we going to do deep creep deep creep. You have a mini creep. Well, it's me, JD. Okay what I go for yours. Well, I go for the Deep creep. Yes, please. So this is also fun creep for me because I wrote it last week. So it's like coming to it fresh again because that's how much  Short-term memories working these days my oh shout out to Hazel Hughes a tcd fun. He sent this to me on Twitter saying that she lost his Sunday afternoon to what I said sounds like an ideal Sunday. This is a dream house and a Nightmare Neighbor. Oh, I remember you talked about this Jesus. Mmm. So as you're not crinkly, I'll just quickly crinkle-cut. I got an open it get your sweeties and guys it's going to  Along one few Parma violets kind of juicing in the crotch just in anticipation too much. It's very fun wearing it elective card good man. Yeah the Zippy and I'm wearing one knitting one.  Hey guys were all settled sweeties in does anyone need to be before we before we kick off know? Okay. So this story takes place in Westfield, New Jersey. It's a beautiful little neighborhood. It's the picture of the American dream. There's large spacious homes tree-lined streets white picket fences everywhere. Gorgeous the whole American Property things amazing like minimum you're living in freaking 2,000 square foot. Yeah. They're huge real is my  Massive so for Maria brought us and her husband Derek. It's the town that they really wanted to call their home. Maria had grown up a few blocks away. But Derek was raised and Main the couple had three children and in the Years preceding 2014. They had moved from a small house to a more spacious house. So they went from a property that was valued at three hundred and fifteen thousand to one that was then worth 770,000, but when you're moving on ugly by wouldn't be comfortable with that.  Sleep but when you know, I want to take it went but I'm in their families their fathers growing. This is you know, the family are young. Obviously they have I think they have more kids move into a bigger place. And then when I House on West Field Boulevard came on the market, they fought to secure it now and the reading about the Westfield property. Boom. I learned that a lot of houses Boulevard was considered the most kind of desirable place to live in  Westfield, so imagine it's like the know  Killiney killiney of New Jersey and houses on Boulevard often went for like a hundred thousand two hundred thousand even 300,000 over the asking price. So they were really competitive in trying to secure this house. Derek had worked his way up the ladder in an insurance company in Manhattan, and he was a senior vice president with a salary large enough for them to afford the 1.3 million dollar house big house right the house.  As previously owned by a couple named Andre and John Woods. It's fucking huge. It was built in 1907 the lipstick fuckin here, which is massive built in 1905. It was 3920 square feet and had six bedrooms four bathrooms. And it's it's about a half an acre of land. I mean considering its surrounded by other houses dots that's a gorgeous bottle and you could grow your potatoes and your rhubarb. There are no problem fish six of my houses into  That it has a wraparound porch a long driveway and in so many of the reports about what in this story. It was actually described as the nicest house on the boulevard therefore the most desirable house to live in in Westfield. Like it's big spacious its gorgeous-looking. I really looks like I put a picture up on the internet but it really looks like the kind of quintessential American huge mansion. Nice kind of them. I'm picturing like the house from Home Alone.  Yeah, but it's got yeah, and it's got kind of the traditional cladding on it in New Jersey as well. Like think of like think of like a kind of like Cape Cod kind of American Dream case that had wooden cladding. Yes. Yes. Yes kind of be our what are we talking about? I'd say a cost Fortune teeth fucking thing. Yeah, Derek, I'm Maria and their three children were delighted to be the new owners. And while the house was in while it was you could move into it. They decided they wanted to do it.  You minor refurbishments to the space before they moved it. It's - it's definitely wise. Yeah, they just wanted to put their own stamp on it, you know just freshen up. I feel like the intro to the story is so focused. I might have lost myself. I did create a lot of yourself did go onto Pinterest and how it'll go what I would do to the house now and not like I want to know what their kitchen Stitches the kitchen is actually quite small. It's disappointing for the size of the house, but they have like a living room a dining room.  Sitting room like they were about five reception rooms downstairs. They could definitely do something to move the kitchen. Yeah. Sorry back in it back in the room Jen. So three days after getting the keys Derek was in the house painting when he received a letter. It's worth noting at this point in the story that the sale was very private. They hadn't even put up a for sale sign and Derek and Maria had made much of a fuss about buying the house. So  It would be unusual like and they hadn't moved in. There wasn't like moving vans. There wasn't that much back and forth. There was a few Renovators and an output like not that much activity around the house that would warrant. You know, you wouldn't be like others new neighbors moving engine. Oh, so the letter was the first of many to come and it read dearest new neighbor at six five seven Boulevard. Allow me to welcome you to the neighborhood six five seven beautified has been the subject of my family for decades now as approaches it  It approaches its 110 birthday. I've been put in charge of watching and waiting for its Second Coming. My grandfather watched the house in the 1920s and my father watched in the 1960s. It is now my time. Do you know the history of the house? Do you know what lies within the walls of six five seven Boulevard? Why are you here? I will find out the left. The ladder reference details of the broadest is life, including their Honda minivan as well as mentioning some of the workers that were renovating the home.  Well, he said he was watching. Yeah, so he said I see already you have flooded of the house. Mmm. I see already that you have flooded six five seven Boulevard with contractors so that you can destroy the house as it was supposed to be tisk tisk bad move. You don't want to make six five seven Boulevard unhappy. So earlier in the week Derek and Maria had gone to the house and chatted with their new neighbors while their children who were five eight and ten were in the back garden with several kids from the neighborhood the letter writers seem to have  I've noticed that the kids were at the back and said you have children. I have seen them so far. I think there are three that I have counted the anonymous correspondent continued before asking if there was more on the way do you need to fill the house with the Youngblood? I requested better for me was your old house too small for the growing family or was agreed to bring to bring me your children once I know their names I will call to them and draw them to me. Whoa.  Yes, so it has no return address and it's really no no and no sorry that you some of them are being posted. Okay, who am I the person wrote there are hundreds and hundreds of cards that cars that drive by six five seven. Boot of art each day. Maybe I'm in one look at all the windows. You can see from six five. Look at all the windows. You can see from six five seven Boulevard. Maybe I am in one look at any of the many windows in six five seven Boulevard at all the people who stroll by each day. Maybe I am one.  That would really take the happy sting and you know, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, and this is how he ends the alert day and the ladder they well this is how we don't know whether it's a man or a woman at this point. Welcome my friends welcome let the party begin right then followed by a signature typed in a cursive font The Watcher.  Would you think it in your mind I would like this feels like the working of a teenage boy.  There's a lot of creepiness and therefore to be just a random. I like why why on Earth so like my go-to things like be a viral marketing stunt for a home security system or something. It's like if you listen to man in the window, it's that podcast by the Golden State killer. I've been on and off with us, but I could only sleep. It's like it's really really fucking creepy. But like there are advertising home security system middle of it like that is just the best content marketing I've ever seen so get people refund.  Freaked out and then give them a subscription-based alarm Services Simply Safe Keep Those rapists away and ask. What year is this again? 2014? Okay. So really could be viral marketing Sky could be right. So Derek took the letter to the police who took the issue quite seriously actually and he advised her to remove a piece of construction equipment that was left on the porch just in case the sender would come by and cause damage to the property. Maria was understandably really freaked out the couple run higher.  Art and reluctant to move into the house Derek canceled a work trip and whenever Maria took the kids to the new house to see it. She would like she wouldn't let them wander off too far. And obviously they started distrusting their neighbors. So couldn't move in. When I started this. I was like, it's either another bitter who's pissed off or a neighbor who's just doesn't want them doing massive Renovations and stuff to the house or just yeah like disgruntled.  No, I just think it's like disgruntled people. There's too much effort going into it's just be around them teenage boy. Like why would you sit down and type out a creepy ladder like that? Anyway, when Derek was giving a tour of the renovation to a couple who lived on the Block he froze when the wife said, I would be nice to have some young blood in the neighborhood. So that's how like they were so on edge that like, even you know, a phrase like that was was was freaking him out.  So two weeks after the first letter arrived Maria stop by the house to look at some paint samples and check any post. She recognized the black lettering on a card shaped envelope and called the police and the letter said welcome again to your new home at six five seven Boulevard. The workers have been busy and I've been watching you unload car Falls of your personal belongings. The dumpster is a nice touch have they found what is in the walls yet in time. They will this time he Direct  By their names but he misspelled their names. Mr. Mrs. Broadus. He said they're brought us this weird where it's happening, but he called them brought us and and they were starting to get really freaked out. Like was he close enough to hear their names was he close enough to hear them talk to the contractors The Watcher boast of Having learned a lot about the family in the preceding weeks, especially about their children the letter identify the three kids by birth order and by their nicknames the ones that Maria have been calling them when they're in the backyard.  Saying I'm pleased to know your names now and the names the Youngblood you have brought to me. It said you certainly say their names often. The letter asked about one child in particular whom the writer had seen using a an easel inside the porch. Is she the artist in the family, they wrote bouquet with the porch. They this big wraparound porch or in the house gorgeous, but there's loads of trees blocking it. So there's very few viewpoints from which you could see into the port.  I'm getting it now. It's the house from Scream.  Yeah, yes. I'm going to need to reference the house from screen, but I will show you the house Borg trees big bit of land but isolated but not not. Yeah, it's not easy. But like it's got good road Frontage and a good back Garden. So it's not like isolated isolator board like this good bit of space between you and your neighbors, you know, like you would neighbor see that Port from inside their eyes. Yes. Okay a neighbor could do you neighbors like least? Yes, but like  To be able to hear people talking you'd want to be really close wearing a minder on half an acre as well. So there are like half a football pitch you're not going to really be able to hear people chat and or even calling names clearly enough to identify their names their nicknames and their birth order. What about those listening from far away devices they exist.  Yeah. Yeah, but you'd want to see them because she's calling that obviously someone is watching her call her children and she's watching the oldest or the tallest one respond to this certain name could be someone in a tree or Kobe. I don't know. I don't know. I'm worked figure this all out together Jennifer. So the letter continued six five seven. Boot of art is anxious for you to move in. It has been years and years since the young boy.  Reeled the hallways of the house. Have you found all the secrets? It holds yet? Well the Youngblood play in the basement or are they too afraid to go down there alone? I would be very afraid if I were them it is far away from the rest of the house. If you were upstairs, you would never hear them scream so creepy. Oh my God, amazing have they started looking into the history of the house yet? Will they sleep in the Attic or will you are sleep on the second floor who has the bedrooms facing the street? I know as soon as you move in it will help me, too.  Know who was in which bedroom then I can plan better all of the windows and doors and six five seven Boulevard. Allow me to watch you and track you as you move toward the house who I who am I I am the Watcher and I have been in control of six five seven Boulevard for the better part of two decades. Now the woods family turns it over to you. It was their time to move on and kindly sold it when I asked them to I passed by many times a day six five seven Boulevard is my job my life my obsession and now you are to brought us family. Welcome to the product of your greed.  Greed is what brought the past three families to six five seven Boulevard. And now it has brought you to me have a happy moving day. You know, I will be watching. Oh, I mean, I'm I'm putting my own spin on the tone. They don't know any of the previous the woods stood the previous owners. So I feel like I would be a good time to contact them. And yes, so they do they do contact the woods at another point, right? So Maria stops bringing the children to the house.  Around the time of them receiving the ladders the first so the first two letters were two weeks apart. It's unclear whether this barbecue happened before the arrival of the second letter or after the arrival of the second letter, but around the time of the debtors the couple were invited to a barbecue across the road to their new neighbor John Schmidt and John told Derek about the lankford's the langford's lived next door to six five seven and Schmidt describe them as really odd Peggy Lanford was in her 90s on her. She'd several of her adult children in their 60s still living with her.  He described one of the younger langford's Michael who didn't work as a kind of Boo Radley character. So he seems a bit strange. So obviously all attention turns to Michael Langford and Derek contacted a local detective detective Lugo who had already visited the house. He was the one who would recommend that they move that piece of equipment off the porch. So he had been visiting the house to assess what proximity the watch Watcher might have had.  Add to the porch to see that the see the daughter he was drawing so he obviously went and was like, what are the viewpoints that are possible here?  The Langford house was right next to the he's on the porch. The family had lived there since the 1960s when the Watchers father the latter's had said had begun observing six five seven Boulevard Richard Langford, the family patriarch had died 12 years earlier on the current Watcher claimed to have been on the job for the better part of two decades. So when Derek went to Lugo about to talk to him about the langford's he said that, you know stuff in the letters match the history of the family that  Art of of the letters was really aligned to what the local history was of the family. So he's like it's you know, clearly the langford's except for the ground does because if the langford's only moved there in the 60s, yeah, but he could have lived elsewhere in Westfield potentially, you know, and so when he told Luke about the family go said he already knew about the family and a week after the first a derived he had brought Michael Langford into the police headquarters for an interview Michael denied knowing anything about the letters, but the broadest to say that Lugo told them that the  narrative or reacted Lugo actually himself said that the narrative matched with the things in the latest were saying and but there was without a confession there wasn't much they could do. So the broadest is feeling sort of unsupported really by the local police went and turned to several experts. So they employed a private investigator who stalked out the neighborhood and run background checks on the line for its but didn't find anything noteworthy and they reached out to a former FBI agent who the FBI agent who served as the inspiration for Clarice starling.  Silence of the Lambs do they love a girl carries clever girl class they just as a coinkidink and I think she must have been working locally in New Jersey who knew amazing and she wants me quite like old enough now this stage if this isn't 2014 and when we Silence of the Lambs 90s, yeah, she was young in silence for a beginner, huh? It was a film this is but she was the inspiration for the character.  Sure that your calories for a moment in Silence the landing so, oh so that Derek and Derek and FBI agent Clarice Starling. This is not we're just going to call it carries to Starling and they were on a High School Board of Trustees to go. That's how they knew each other just to tie that in there just did my research and they also hired another former FBI agent Robert Lanahan who conducted a threat assessment.  He recognized several old-fashioned ticks in the letters that pointed to an older writer. The envelope was addressed to M - M brought us the salutations included the day's weather warm and humid sunny and cold sunny and cool for a summer day and the sentences had double spaces between them. The letters had a certain literary style would suggested an Avid Reader and a surprising lack of profanity and despite the level of anger that he's talking about in the letters. And so thought it might be a less.  Is macho writer? So by the end of 2014 the renovations the house were finished. But Maria and Derek were reluctant to move in any more letters the letters continued and became more and more bizarre. Here's another excerpt from a letter six five. Seven. Boot of art is turning on me. It is coming after me. I don't understand. Why what spell did you cast in it? It used to be my friend. And now it's my enemy. I am in charge of six five seven Boulevard. It is not in charge of me. I will fend off its bad things and  For it to become God again. It will not punish me. I will rise again. I will be patient and wait for this to pass and for you to bring the Youngblood back to me six five. Seven Boulevard needs Youngblood. It needs you. Come back. Let the Youngblood play again. Like I once did let the young blood seep in six five seven Boulevard stop changing it and let alone  so the couple were like fuck this and they moved him at Maria's parents couple blocks away. So like close the house, but I think if I'd spent that much money and their continued with it and they're still renovating it. Yeah. Okay, so there's still no. I mean there's there there were renovating for like six months. It's the mom next door my eyes hurt. You don't think so.  I don't think so. I don't that there's no motive. Well, it doesn't sound like there's why don't you three things that they need motive means and opportunity who need let's take the like the the law in the u.s. When they're like trying to prove a case. They need to they prove motive means and up. It must be is that opportunity, but I guess that was another em, but this person said this is going to be another ladder day sensing whatsoever. I mean, it's implying the house is it?  Entity that speaking to him. He does what's even scarier about it. So someone has like this bizarre like nonsensical connection to this house. That's that's creating a lot of anger and resentment and it's completely illogical which I think is even scarier than someone who would like I'm you know, disputing your planning permission. Okay, you know, it's like yeah, it's someone who's just obviously not thinking straight.  And it's like otic and there's like continuous letters. Oh my little sleepy then what happens so six months after buying the house. The broadest has been each side dog passing through these distracting. She's so cute and she loved this house has loads of garden turn around gorgeous someday and so six months after buying the house the broadest has decided to sell it. They initially put it off for slightly more than 1.3 million a page to reflect the renovations. They had done.  Obviously not much interest in it, not much interest because there's potential buyers pursued the property the couple disclose the ladders and any interest seems Irish, but they felt like they had to and so to make matters worse. There was rumors of stalking murder and general creepiness flying about Westfield and in June 2015 a year after buying six five seven Boulevard, they filed a legal complaint against the woods has arguing that the woods is should have disclosed the ladder just the the woods had said just before they  they moved out they had received a letter but they don't disclose what was written in the letter but they thought it was weird rather than creepy and they the broadest has argued that they should have disclosed the letter and showed it to them. And so they were filing a legal complaint suing them taking them to court which meant they have to make the letters public they wanted to do it really privately in a quiet settlement. They hadn't told her kids about the Watcher and the lawyer assured them that add apps.  Most a small legal news wire might pick up on the story but like overall people wouldn't be too interested in this kind of like suit back and forth. He was wrong a local reporter have found the complaint which included Snippets of the Watchers menacing threats and after belated attempt by the are after an attempt by the broadest has to seal the story. The story went viral actually news trucks camped out at six five seven Boulevard and one local reporter set up a lawn chair to conduct his own watch.  They got more than 300 media requests requests, but with advice from a crisis management consultancy refer to one of their colleagues, they decided not to speak publicly to spare their kids even more attention. So they vague they left Westfield at that point at all. Just got too much and they went off to a friend's Beach House LTG. They had a friend of the beaches. Thank God. I can't believe that the investigation with Clarice had they're not  Only thing the only thing in can get to a charity but the only thing of Interest they pulled up was that they did a DNA sample of the envelope and they found that it was likely to have been written like likely to been written by a woman but what they can connect everything. Okay? Yeah. Yeah good point. So people were suggesting they do like that kind of heat. Yeah mapping thing, but they're not going to knock down walls not going to knock down loads of internal walls on the other end.  The threat that there might be something I go back through the kind of town records. They were going back and they found nothing of Interest like it's not like some Amityville Horror. No, no there was and there was a family that lived behind them and a couple that live behind an older couple and they used to sit out in lawn chairs in the rock garden and they were deemed to be like in close enough proximity that they could have heard what was going on and their daughter married a guy who used to  Even the house but like there was no ill-will. There was no bad blood that made no sense that there would be any reason for him to to hate the family had moved in and it was nobody else. I don't think like they went they eliminated all of the other bidders as potential and so specs people that were you know, either I think we went to all the other bidders and they'd either bought other houses or settled on other things. They were happy out like no made no sense so as this  Story gained more traction, obviously the community became more and more creeped out and children were scared families on Boulevard grew concerned that the media attention would impact the value of their homes and they soon turned against the broadest has the theories range that foot some thinking that the broadest that had suffered buyer's remorse and that they were concocting this whole mod story to try and like quickly. I don't know get rid of the house. But like we're surely just selling a nice house is a better way to do it.  They realized that I couldn't afford the home but they can you know, oh that they were conducting this to get out of the sale. But like it happened post-sales. So that's Harry was soon quashed and then there was a theory that they wanted to get a movie deal and it was all an elaborate weirder plot to try and get a movie deal which again totally unfounded. So a retired veteran in the police department was assigned to the case, but the only notable finding was the analysis of the DNA and the envelopes that can  glued at the center was likely a woman.  Maria and Eric continue to try and sell the house. They're my two year old still live next door that 90 year old woman. Yeah langford's Mom. Yeah Peggy. She still like ya to living there, but I guess she mobile. Oh, I think she was real died very early and start. I don't think she was like, well, you know, I mean, they just keep her in a drawer under the bed like that. After that. It is actually difficult to sneak around though. You're not delivering what they looked like, they ruled out the line for it as suspects. They looked at the line for it.  Sister and everything they were like, maybe Michael was writing the letters and she was just licking licking envelopes and they were all ruled out. So Maria and Eric continue to try and sell the property their estate agent suggested that they try to sell it to a developer and split the plot into two homes and but the community rejected the planning proposal to do so which really pissed him off because it broke some guidelines that there had to be like 80 yards of a plot and there's was like 76 or something like that.  That and yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, there was planning permission for other plots, you know in the in the area that broke the but, you know broke the regulations with kind of more of a margin of error, but they were just with the people at yeah, they had just turned against them. But you know, like they didn't trust them load. They didn't want to believe that there was something unsafe happening in Westfield is the real.  Problem. So to acknowledge the problem would be to say oh look, there is someone who's creepier stalker or has mental health issues in Westfield. Like they were very much like this is a perfect little town loads. We want to live here. Look at our gorgeous houses piss off with your problems kind of thing and so in good news, so they were stuck with this house. They were living in kind of a friend's beach house for a while. Then they gathered enough money from friends and family to be able to buy another house elsewhere.  Like they have no intention at this point in living in the house that really just be trying to sell it and but when they disclose the letters to people during the Sally the cell process so sale process people just drop out of it because they're that creepy like and there was loads of people who taught for getting on live in the house, you know, people be like, it's Grant or whatever. He were interested. He were pursuing it and then would read the letters and be like, no I'm not moving in here. So like their word are threatening to people so  They continue to come I mean after your idea of media attention so they somebody is seeing the our guests. Some of them are posted aren't it? Yeah, some of them are posted but they're getting at I think they're getting less and less frequent. Where you going.  And so they couldn't when they couldn't sell the house. They did get some good news that a family with grown-up children agree to rent the house. But on the condition that they could pull out of the lease if they were getting more letters and shortly after they arrived a letter was delivered and said violent winds and bitter cold the violent spiteful Derek and his wench of a wife Maria. Did the nude the nude there the other day L. Don't know Derek and Derek Maria of the broadest. Okay. Okay you wonder  The Watcher is turn around idiots. Maybe you can even maybe you even spoke to me one of the so-called neighbors who has no idea who the Watcher could be or maybe you know me and are too scared to tell anyone could move. I walked by the news trucks when they took over my neighborhood and mocks me I watched as you watch from the dark house and attempt to find me telescopes and binoculars are wonderful inventions, six five seven Boulevard survived your attempted assault and stood strong with its Army of supporters supporters. Barricading its Gates my  Soldiers of the boulevard followed my orders to a tee They carried out their mission and saved the Soto six five seven Boulevard with my orders all hail the Watcher. So the letters suggesting that the planning permission was rejected because the water has somehow convinced people of the time to let the house stand so still not satisfying still not satisfied with just pushing the broadest has away from their dream home. The Watcher was vengeful and ended threatening violence towards the family maybe a car accident maybe a fire.  Be something as simple as a mild illness that never seems to go away but makes you feel sick day after day after day after day, maybe the mysterious death of a pet loved ones suddenly died planes and cars and bicycles crash bones break.  Lady fucking creepy. So this better not just Peter. I have some emo poetry, you know, isn't it? So the broadest is never moved into the house after borrowing money from the friends and family. They managed to purchase a house nearby but far enough from six five seven, but of art the latest that I found on the house is that it actually did they did manage to salad sold in July of this year for approximately nine hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Bargain. Yes 6,000 square foot.  Bargain Hazel the final latter the Derek received red you are despised by the house and the Watcher one The Watcher never identified, but Netflix have just commissioned the film this ha ha ha really come on. Our the broadest has executive producers pretty sure they are because I think they did it to offset the loss at their reasoning was of setting the loss of what they mean. They've lost like $350,000 in this house plus the  Years of their lives. Yeah, it's huge. I can't believe they weren't able to locate that considering the square football free. I think we've ever had I know I was so into it. I was waiting for it to transpire to be something but guys, I'm sorry. I slipped it. I went on Reddit try to find load speed there's loads of theories of like who it could be a lot of people on Reddit from the area believe that it's the lying for its but they were ruled out as suspects so I have to  But you could also see it if you were walking by the house and walk close the house. It's not the only spot from which you could see it and The Watcher. He never actually did a thing to them. Just so just loads of threatening letters and creepiness and ruin their dream his eyes Talia Italian for not a load of 60 year old single to their mother.  Eve night that the Langford Czar have mental health issues are could be have severe learning difficulties. You know, like I think there's a reason that there's a couple of adult children living at home. They could certainly implied with Michael Langford that he has advanced learning difficulty. So he wouldn't have been able for the letters in the first be might have been it but he wouldn't have been declared him. Anyway. Yeah declared him Tom.  What's the highest address called again, six? Five? Seven Boulevard Westfield, New Jersey you'll like the way it's six five seven Google suggests immediately and one realtor to have a look at it. Yeah, so you can because it only sold recently there's loads of interior looks like a mummy's Amityville Horror house. How do you say that a medieval? I was evil and so blue balls in creepy. Yeah, but  First but there's a great long form read in the cut about it. That's where I yeah, I just gasps creature unless his name the journal name was fucking journals and its recent it was a ridden last year and it's the article has been the starting point for commissioning the film why it's a really really long reach and thank you again to Hazel use for slipping on in to my DMs. Thank you come with that.  Or any I fuckin loved visuals of the letter theirselves on the or any of the letters imaged Reeves Weidman was the journalist beautiful name just flows off the tip of that. It's such a gorgeous house that when I tell you something for nothing, right? If someone did that to me when I build my lovely gorgeous Big Heist and Waco for me and Scout and as you live and grow our potatoes and rhubarb, then I'm still going like they love writing letters in Wickliffe.  Do they they hate planning permission don't they? Thank you Kathy Kathy. You guys are welcome. You want to hear mine? Yes. Have you ever heard of Area 51. Do you know where it all came from? I don't know. If I do. I'll tell you Bob Lazar your guy. Yeah, so funny that he put Area 51 in the Muppet what 30 Years Ago by  doing an interview with a journalist stating that he worked.  in a place  Called S4 which is a military facility near Area 51 and so he was working for the as far as he was concerned for the u.s. Government in a top secret. So I really wanted to be like workin for the man every night and day fucking while Sophie. Okay. He was working for it bit of background on Bob very interested in propulsion.  explosives  As a child he built a what they call it like a jet engine for the back of his bicycle. She still uses around his own home now to this day. He's a science man and has various or so. He says degrees from MIT and he's qualified person of science. Okay, and so he was hired because of his background in propulsion.  And replied to an ad went to the interview, right so so turdy years ago.

Yeah with his, you know, resume and his knowledge of explosives and interview is going well.  Seems like he was getting the job. So the guy who was interviewing him and said look, I have to do a load of to get you clearance. I'm going to have to go away and do a load of work here is some information on the job that you've been hired to do. So he slides across the table a load of files and so Bob was like, all right, so we start flicking through the files and it's looking more and more like Bob was hired.  To reverse engineer a spaceship. Oh, hey. Yeah, so he was like, I can't discuss this unbelievable. It's absolutely unbelievable. Unbelievable. So down the pub after people did his head to the guy directly presumably at the time as well. He was sworn to secrecy and sign for ya. Never say anything so concerned he can turn so he went to work doing just that. So Bob's job.  Job was so according to Bob this facility had I think it was nine spaceships. Some of them were operational as in they were able to move them around fly them even some of them weren't and Bob never got a look at any although he did say once he walked past a corridor window a door on the card or you know, one of those like you see them in movies like thick glass lots of metal like  Through it. Oh, yeah lured an in there. He saw what he thought he saw were two men in lab coats speaking today down to a small figure with very long arms sitting in a chair with his back to the window. That's all he really was willing to talk like him Space Monkey. I fuckin Spaceman a lie a lie, of course, he told his alien so no. No, he said no, he backtracks a bit there and talk side and said look, that's why.  I think I saw it was a tiny flash of a second. I don't know any more than that. Mostly we're focusing in on the spaceships. Hmm. So the spaceships where were exactly as you're imagining a disk. Yeah. They had at the bottom three like propulsion element things. Look the way he described the moving is does check out in terms of sash tag Science. Bob does know about science.  T run yeah, I know the this day a company called Earth called like nuclear elements or something. It's very sciency scientist. If I was to be a scientist don't convince people. I was a scientist. I would definitely call my science company. I'm giving popular a lavash I hear right this plant science are so tear in his current science companies a lab. He has people working there and what they're making is their kind of you can buy and sell small bits of science like like a small amount of  mercury or you know, you can for like home experiments that like up above board. But so back to the spaceship in Barber deserve. I'm absolutely am but I'm trying to basically like a bob runs the Arts and Crafts shop for science to look at Bob. You would say domino science. Okay, he has a kind of a way of to wear a lab coat. He was wearing a lab coat and base. Okay, Harry Harry watching an episode of look arranged. No. No, this is a legit. I  Entry on Netflix. But the reason this is also in the news right now is because there's a Facebook group that's called storming Area 51. It's a guy who set it up as a joke or some I think it's due in September right gain traction then so he said like here look they can't catch us all yeah. Yeah if we just brought in. Yeah, so that's the whole idea now we got acting I think a hundred thousand people are confirmed going to this event. Are you attending? Yeah, and so Bob has come out and said don't do that, please as he's the last guy who tried to do. They just shot him dead. So,  So look do probably more than a hundred thousand bullets. I will never back to the story. So Bob's job was to figure out how these things worked and how these things worked was by letting I hear you had a great. He told me that he had great. I'll see if I can remember correctly. So basically they were bending they were using gravity to propel. So bending the space-time Continuum effectively, so he described it as like put a bowling ball on a mattress now press  Fist into the mattress and then the bowling ball is going to roll into the hole, which if it's just so that's how this things would work and there is an element that was allowing this to happen, which was coined element all one one five. I think I think it it that's a very important thing. Anyway, there's element to our confirm what exactly it was called was something that Bob talked about in his interview right with that name and he explained it as interview back then.  He hasn't changed in 30 years. What is this? Markovian? Yeah. So what's an element 1 1 1 1 1 5 so this element exists now but it isn't can kind of controls basically haven't been able to put it into working function. It was only discovered in 2003. There you go. And Bob was talking about this back 30 years ago. So basically what's happening now is at the time of the interview catching up with Bob, correct? Yes. So at the time of the interview everyone went fucking well.  It seems like it was sort of a big fucking joke. Basically I think as well because he was in his 20s in the interview and you can see the old interview footage. He was sort of trying to there's a lot he was very self-aware it look it was a piss. He's a bit cocky or I don't know it just you just didn't want to like him did he just fuck the job in and do the interview. He stated his belief. Yeah, he did and his belief was that this element would change everything everything now it would effectively end the  Need for any kind of fossil fuels or any type of it basically all propulsion or things that Propel forward have kind of you know, they Propel and they there's something comes out the back right? Yeah, but there was there is no output for this particular kind of reaction and that's what makes it so unique. So, you know, when you burn fossil fuels they release carbon monoxide and that's the iPod or and the explosion in a car engine like in the in the  The Pistons and then your exhaust yes kind of the output so that's what's so amazing and valuable exactly exactly everything. That's yeah so it and even back then there was real. Yeah. So what they were doing this like cars for decades, I have one. So so what they doing what they were doing this lab was absolutely locked down secret and he signed away away energy. I think yes because like  Like he goes on to say in various articles and in this documentary available on Netflix Netflix called Barbers are this if they released it if that it would change the economics of the world. So he's kind of reasoning for doing the thing. And so I'd blown it all up was that we have this we have this now the world needs to know about it this needs to be action. Now we need to start using this and it is kind of convincing like he was like, whatever about the fuckin aliens.  They have them to this point. Yeah, but I think it is true. I think I think it is true what they say that the chance of there being no other living or you know life in the world or in our universe is highly unlikely and Ice probably, you know, there are aliens totally the first martyr. He better looking than we are well apparently much smaller and longer limbed. So anyway, so where was I so it's it is fascinating but what Bob also said was in the early interview talked about this hand scanner.  Machine right that he that you were used to identify people as they came into the lab and what it would do would be measured the length of the bones in your hand. That was effectively that was sort of put supposed to be like fingerprint. I guess it was unique to you and if that was kind of what he talked about back then that was part of the you know, his things he could remember as being proved. So another thing that has come out as being true fact, so the guy who was doing this documentary he is for Netflix. Whose name. I can't remember Kay.  Came to interview Bob with a photograph of this hand scanner that Bob had been talking about years and years and years ago and I was like, oh my God, I can't believe this I haven't seen this in but that's exactly it. That's the very one now if you go online and do a bit of sleuthing a lot of people  Basically debunking Bob Yeah. Well, yeah. Yeah and this particular piece of Machinery, you know Close Encounters by the Third Kind apparently this featured in that movie which was even a hand scanner. Yeah, which was in fact just before it was in the late 70s or something films. So look, there's a lot of it's really just a fascinating story and it does really feel like Bob is telling the fucking truth.  So there is a bit so it's science. There's a bit shot in the film and towards the end of the film and basically Bossman sort of played by FBI raids various people trying to fucking kill him. But you know, and he is places raided his kind of you know his lap and he owns is raided during the process of filming this documentary and it sort of he's suggesting a feels like because Bob said to the documentary record look at the they're saying verbatim conversations me and you have had  So it's nearly suggestion. Are you a doctor or it's most likely he's booked. So there's a piece in it rice. So you're watching the film and the FBI raid happens and he's texting the documentary maker saying the FBI are here again the rating my property they're saying things we've spoken about and he sends the documentary maker of foot, you know clips of the FBI in his home. Hmm, and there's a breakaway then and it's just a documentary maker.  Asking Bob like okay you wanted me to film this section. We're going to put it under lock and key this particular piece and you can like it's just going to exist. It's not going to fit if you know feature in the documentary, but it feels like and they kind of sort of exposed that it sounds like Bob might have smuggled a piece of this element out of the lab back then and there's a suggestion. That's the reason the FBI are continuously searching and searching his property raiding the  I'm trying to figure it out. And so we don't know so it kind of breaks away at that point and the documentary maker said look Bob. Okay, that's there. So whatever you said exists and proof now and time. So whatever happens from here on in that's something you've told me and it's never exposed basically, so we don't know as a watcher what that is, but it feels like Bob might be saying  here's where I'm keeping it. God damn it. This is where I told me thing and it him being like Oh, I have a Muscovy. Mm. Yeah I back it seems a chest freezer. Exactly. So this is a fucking amazing story. I would highly recommend going and watching the watching the documentary and it's fascinating and I did you ever get sued for breaking the original NDA. Well, it doesn't sound like it I didn't go deep on that and they don't talk about it much in the film, but he talks about it didn't work there long.  Did he try and reverse engineer the thing he did? I mean, yeah you work tonight and he he I'm sure along with his team. Yeah, so he drew out exactly how it worked and it makes sense as long as this particular element is exhibitors. And because when he says able to be stabilized and used for that purpose, like currently it's not there's a suggestion that it's not it would never be stable enough to do it. But it if it's my very brief reading. Yeah, if you could problem is it's not stable exactly then this is exactly what it could be used for.  So that's the story so far of Bob Lazar and it definitely isn't over Baba is it is a really really compelling like yeah. Yeah, like his story hasn't changed in 30 years at all. He also goes on and on and he's like, he's lost money from this. He's lost jobs. He I think it won't put in the interviews, like look if you knew now watching, you know back then do you think he'd even do you think he'd have done this in?  You said definitely not. Yeah, like it has been costly and even then like why so you while I what yeah was like you were saying like but also what's happened what has what has happened since it's so Bob had a couple of other jobs at various places on the lead-up to being hired by In This S4 Place. Hmm and his whole like they've wiped him from existence. You can't find any proof of his  his qualifications were his previous job experience and I'm Bob himself was like look, they hardly just hired me out of high school. Yeah, why would I have gotten the job but the place he worked previous to this s floor place and another science-based thing more about propulsion said they had no record of Bob Lazar every working there. But if you I think one of the guys got a like a roll call of that basically extension phone numbers. Yeah and his  I'm was there along with what you presume was his extension at the time. Yeah, so this kind of bits and Bobs like that and it's you think of delete the government could do just erase your fucking degree from git I'd say they could do that. No problem. Absolutely. No problem. And even when I was thinking I was like to win why I got this shit they did with the fucking MKUltra and shit like that. Like it's nothing's off limits for them. Yeah, so then so yeah, so I was thinking then as well like this would  Not have any proof of being in college, but I guess it's there's no fucking facebooker to know you're like, yeah, I don't really remember. There's enough Witnesses also the products what happened to him that they don't want to be involved maybe that but there's also his Pals, you know are saying like, yeah, we went to college together. Yeah, and I dropped him off every day. And yeah, so it is like his friends have stayed remained the same and his friends have backed him up.  Ever since like he didn't lose. Do you know he's obviously showed his friends element 1 1 pipe. Yeah. So there's a piece as well. I fucking should have paid more attention, but there is there is a piece of footage that they show and it like 60 second. It's like a like under a microscope but some sort of reaction. It proves nothing but then it's marked as element 1 1 5 it's like as if it was a piece of film and Bob had said, oh, I don't know where that is. I think I have a bit of footage and your mama dog.  Andrew Baker went through all of his gear and find this VHS but again doesn't necessarily prove anything. Yeah, you know just labeled it as I expected but your non-scientists amongst us. Yeah, we wouldn't just like a kind of a dark thing. Anyway, yeah, so that's the story of Bob. What are you looking at there? I'm looking at the project that we're they claimed that they were making experimental projects one called Ox cart and 1/4.  Nerva that they think inadvertently prompted many of the UFA. You have a rumors like it's the obviously official line, which is that they the oxcart was apparently unprecedented. It had a wide disk-like fuselage designed to carry vast quantities of fuel. Apparently. Yeah. This is what they're saying. Bob's getting him few. Yeah. They're like pops just confused. Yeah, and we were actually just trying out.  A flying saucer Mushy Mushy looked an awful lot like like it but also on the Facebook event to storm Area 51 is actually close to 2 million people shit for don't have that many bullets. Yeah, when is the temperature million and a half are still like a waging confirm when it's like confirmed it interested. There's like a hundred. Sorry, then 1,400,000 maybes chanted.  So it's scheduled for the 20th of September. That's dude. You're right. It's billed as storm Area 51, they can't stop all of us in an attempt to see them aliens. Bob suggest. We shouldn't do that. Oh my God, Sophie amazing, though know very, you know, you can see why they would want to block us. You could understand but those taught me you're watching and death is in there. Yeah, if it's not like alien technology or whatever. Thanks.  Great-looking but theory is that people should be told of a swell wait for this. I read at me down Russians get it building the ark no no listen way over it. The and Dan was like I was like hardest yet saying all those things like Jesus, you know, we really got to we got to know what's in there and I said, well, maybe not Shane clock to Armageddon. He said well what if the aliens are watching us and kind of gauging how how our technology is coming along and if we surpass a certain point of knowledge in terms of  AG doll just destroys but until then we're not really seen as a threat. So he was saying what if the government are using the technology in order to potentially build a force field of protection so that if I don't dance darks forgot  Why bother when you can talk anyway, that's Bob. That's I love Area 51 like there's lots more juice for years on it. Yeah, we need an alien specific shape next time. Okay, I mean, obviously I fully believe of course. I think it's complete like the height of weird arrogance to think that were the only yeah, like kind of know, we're 100% not the only living thing but it's real are they  To be honest, well as you see it here knitting you're continually large Square would be interested in you that were where did she get the technology? Am I right in saying there's a piece of thread up the whole of one of the knitting needles know there's needles are attached to knitting needles are attached to each other. Okay. That was a little segue. Anyway, thanks for listening. Thanks said it was okay to come by.  This money asking and we did a bit on the dog chat. Give us some Patron if you want to that's fine. If you don't lovely but please do consider purchasing my forthcoming book. Oh, yeah filled with a little book called filter this it's actually there's some elements of creep to us. It's not out yet though, but you can pre-order it reorder it now on Ethan's or debris. It's called filter this and it's by Sophie white, right? Yep. We'll think of other things to flog next week us father's I'm not interested. I've creep on Twitter.  I'm creeped. I've on Instagram. That's that's it or just in the streets. We love when you come up and say hi. Nobody has ever done thankful fucking happens they have to do is I don't know why people don't do to you. I think somebody actually I feel like I should shout out to Emma who wasn't the post office chick. Oh, yeah. There you go. What's up? Yeah, what's up mother reported? It's too hard not to worry. Thank you everyone. Thank you all thank you to especially our patrons the truth is out there.  Bye so he's like stuck in thought there.

spotify:episode:3yay5bqGUN6ER82mTNlDQT	Hello and welcome to swell the lgbtq podcast where you get to learn how to love yourself and also learn about self care tips overcoming physical and mental well-being issues and various other.  Lgbtq, related hints and tips that we find good to discuss about. I'm Anna and I'm from the real massage, which is an lgbtq massage service in Brighton, and I'm George a lgbtq focused personal trainer also based in Britain. And this is our first ever episode of this well podcast. So because it's the first time please go easy yet. We're vegetarians. So go slow.  So over the next few weeks and we're going to be discussing topics, which we feel the lgbtq community would like to be listening to and could benefit from hearing about such as self-care trauma addiction alcohol abuse depression mental health anxiety. Yeah, and crucially what we want to do is we want to talk about our own experiences with with those things and how we got through them to the other side to where we are now. Yeah, basically our paths crossed.  Business and then we discovered that we both actually been through quite a lot of shit and come out the other side. So when we picked it apart, so actually there's quite a quite a lot that we could discuss and potentially help others with going forward. Yeah, and I think what's really important to say there is that when our paths crossed we were both in this really really great happy place and it feels like when you're in that space it's really important to give back to the community and to share thoughts and ideas.  Diaz yeah, I mean particularly lgbtq community that there's a lot of talk about what we've been through and or suppression and the bad things and that's very necessary. But actually there's not a great deal of material about talking people talking about how they've got through it. And now that they're thriving yes, there is light at the end of the tunnel. Yeah, and sometimes all you see a reference to those people say it gets better. But what does it look like and how do you do it? Yeah, we're both.  Well, we discovered that we're both lucky to be in positions of privilege because we feel happy right now and I just want to share that. I just want to help other people learn techniques and learn how to be happy and their best selves actually. No, I mean babes I do and part of that means sharing our stories The Good the Bad and the Ugly the very ugly the monkey the total month and absolutely  so collectively George and I have both been through some really serious shit and fucking our history is like George. I think it's fair to say you had a bit of an issue with drugs a little bit and I don't think there's anything by a shepherd of double it up, you know, actually I have  And other item there is a write up her nose at various points. Obviously alcohol issues for both of us. And what about you Anna? What else do we got? Well, we got bit of Developmental trauma PTSD, so and we both kind of struggle with our bodies. Absolutely and that's what led to our paths Crossing in the first place struggling with queer identity and Body Image. Yeah.  Yeah.  So George, let's talk a little bit more about your struggle. And what went down there for you. Okay, I mean I struggle with anxiety and depression. I wasn't an anxious kid. Not that I remember but I think I developed into anxiety as a teenager and what I think is even though even now it's more accepting to come out but I don't care how much it's accepted it still really hard for you to understand what's going on.  In your head and I think that was part of something that made me anxious like what the hell is going on? Why do I have feelings for this person? Did I mean and even though that was like 15 years ago, so it was harder to come out at that point. I just think I really struggled with that so that probably contributed to my anxiety and depression then that kind of intertwines with drugs and alcohol doesn't it's like a form of escapism. I've had a bit of a dealing with suicide which I'd like to pick apart in another podcast. But yeah some stuff some stuff.  What about you? So I grew up in a really rural Scottish community and I didn't know what gay was and I think when you're growing and you're slowly realizing there's something different like the Disney movies don't really apply to you. You can't ever really see yourself with a man. If you don't know what gay is it's like you grow with no sense of self and I can remember being at school and looking back. I think this is my first ever interaction with someone.  He was gay though. I didn't know it at the time. I had a PE teacher who is like as far as like what your view is birch. Oh my God. I had a standard isn't it have absolute idiots like to have a bitch PE teacher and I remember a lot of the the mums and dads would talk about her and there was just this General vibe that whatever she was was not okay, you've got to picture this. This is like a rural Scottish farming community in the 1990s. Okay. It's  Very Wicked man. Yeah, so we're making little straw dollies for the Harvest Festival. Okay, and we have this Harvest show at everyone from the community gets invited to come see us perform a higher show in the church Hall and incomes my PE teacher and she is legit wearing a suit with a tie in brokes good for her. I bet she rocked it. She did but you couldn't hear that. She was rocking it for all the deafening silence in the room because everyone just went quiet.  I remember knowing like whatever she's just done is not. Okay, and then in the car ride home, I was just very aware that.  Everyone else in the car, like other kids are their parents. It was not okay. Hmm, and I think maybe somewhere in me. Subliminally. I knew she was gay like maybe it was like little baby gaydar was just starting to take tentative flight. I knew that my teacher was was a lesbian, right and I learned that it's not okay that that wasn't. Okay. Yeah, so that was kind of like my first interaction with being gay. So I learnt the wherever I was that wasn't to be that yeah.  Want to be gay and that led to like a lot of really really vulnerable stuff about doing anything to feel accepted and to make people believe I was straight and that lends a lot of Rudy trauma for me. Mmm. So then how did that come about like, what does that turn to in terms of alcohol? And/or? You know, I think as I got older obviously when you're younger how you suppress your identity is very different to how you do it is as a young adult and I think as I go into my adolescent and young adult years I started  By doing a lot of shopping lot of spending money buying clothes. I supposed to make myself look like what I thought a straight person was. Hmm and I started drinking alcohol to make myself feel comfortable in straight situations that deep down. I didn't want to be in because I was gay. Yeah food babes Technics. Yeah. So one of the harder things is understanding what's happening, even though you're young and you feel like there's something different about you.  You don't know what it is and the penny isn't dropping just yet. If that makes sense. Just this niggling feeling something's off that you're different. Yeah. Yeah, like for me. Do you remember when Tipping the Velvet came on TV? Oh my God. I love Tiffany of those unite are like your 31 and I'm 30, so I would have been like  14:15 right about that age when it came on the TV and I could just remember being like what the actual fuck is this? Oh my God, I gotta wow. I have a bit of an embarrassing story want it but you go first I watch Tiffany over I was at my grandma's house and she was like, oh there's this new period drama and I really want to watch it and I'll say okay. Yeah love a period drama sitting in the lounge watching Tipping the Velvet with my grandma. I was absolutely mortified.  It's and then there was obviously lesbian sex scenes and I was like Pride and Prejudice. It was not right and I could sense how awkward she fell and at the same time I had such Roseate but my face was so red obvious because I was obviously excited and confused and sat with my Grandma at the same time. I'll holy ball bag. This is horrendous. So yeah, that was my first experience of Tipping the Velvet. Did you like it though? I loved  And then I went home and obviously watched it on my own and just thought this is what is a family show. Like wow. I was like why am I so connected to this almost but because I was 14 15, I'd already started to think. Yeah, I like girls, but that really hit home for me being on TV and it being from years ago. Like I think I was at eighteen hundreds or something. Yeah. So this is a real thing. Yeah, and it was a real thing. Yeah, toe.  And I think for me like I was in the same position that like I was starting to think maybe I liked girls because you know how it goes like you start getting like really weird crushes on just like women on the TV. Yeah, and you can't work out if like you want to be the best friend or do you want to let it show go get really confused and that you're going for let the Freeman's catalog and you're like do I like what you're wearing or do I just like yeah. Yeah. Do I want to wear that or do I want to look at you?  I was going through that and you've got imagine this like there's a little suppressed pathway in my head. That's like Girls Girls Girls Girls Girls Girls Girls Girls good. Yeah, exactly. Yeah is it mostly greens are so I think yeah. It's like a Motley Crew playlist my head 24/7 at this point little 14 year old me and suddenly Tipping the Velvet comes on and it's like that little pathway just gets like blown to fucking Smithereens because suddenly I'm like, oh my God. Oh God.  I'm only a Victorian lesbian what's going on in my annoys to go? Like if I'm just a nice to go? Yeah, and I got so into the actress to play Nan Rachel study that in English class and I don't know what the fuck to my English teacher thought was going on, but we had to write some creative writing. So I wrote a Rachel Sterling fan fiction when I got two kids Rachel stirred egg. And can you believe I handed that it took for marketing?  Like here's this is my he's my biggest sexual fantasies for Utah. That's a mark. What grade did you get? Probably you probably liked going there for probably got like a fucking letter to the council my very first crush girl crush. I remember I was 14 15 and Tipping the Velvet came out. But the first one where I remember thinking. Oh God, what is this? I'm feeling was do.  Of the my parents alien. Try to say what you were feeling. Mmm was gay. That was the feeling of okay, but do you remember the show? My parents aliens? Yeah. Oh my God, so I can't remember how old I must have been when I was watching. That was younger than that. I'm just maybe 10 or 11 and Mel the oldest sister. So there's three of them. I want to remember their names Mel Josh and it was the other one the little girl think the smart girl. Anyway, that's it. Smart-arse. Yeah.  Is that Mel was like this teenage angsty. Like I just thought she was the coolest thing. I fancied her so much. She had all this makeup and piercings and just choose. Yeah, and I was like man, I dig that and I was like, but what do I dig what's going on is the hair clips. Nice it the girl. Yeah. That was my very first lesbian Crush that I remember. Yeah. Yeah, but actually just on a side note.  He quickly I do remember watching Lucy Liu and Calista Flockhart kissing and Ally McBeal when I was about 7 and remember my sister saying oh that's really gross. And I remember thinking is it that's so like yeah dig that too and that I was really young when I watch that. So yeah, so I know what do you feel like those experiences taught us as we were growing up?  I think it taught us that we couldn't be our authentic selves and the we learned that being gay was a source of Shame and as we've suppressed that that's led to some of the difficult stuff. We ended up going through later in life. Yeah. I think that's a very good way of putting it. If you can't live your authentic self, you're not going to truly happy in my opinion and that's what this is all about. So that brings us to the end of the first ever episode of this world the introductory episode.  There's next time we're going to be talking about alcohol and drug addiction in the lgbtq community and how not to be a hot mess and how not to end up in hospital or how maybe you have been a hot mess or R1 currently, but, you know, you can get through that you can just be hot and days, so we're gonna sign off now, so bye guys later.  How do you think that like do you think Rachel Sterling is going to sue us? Wow, I don't think I don't think we even need a hit baby. Okay, I was kind of like it if she did do so when you're into I'm just a nice to go for whitstable Dunstable whitstable. Don't support unstable. Where is Dunstable? I don't know. 	This is the first ever episode of SWELL.  Meet George and Ana, two LGBTQ practitioners, and listen as we start to lift the lid on our stories of growing up facing homophobia.

We are chatting about all sorts vlogging online classes batching podcast and finally getting away for a holiday and some down time. So I hope that you enjoy the episode. Let's get straight into it. Hello Laura he going I'm very good. I should I say good morning Laura. It's bright in the mornings here. The sun is coming up at about 5:30 a.m. So we've been getting up very early doing bits and bobs.  As in the mornings lately, it's very good witch and a while ago on the podcast. I tooked about how how I had changed in that area and started getting up and doing a bit of work in the mornings and that has continued on I think I'm probably into about six seven weeks of that now it'll be interesting now because we go on holidays to me today. I wonder if we'll still get up at 5:30 quarter to 6:00 every morning. I think we will accept the clocks go forwards so it's going to start.  Like darker in the mornings. So that's going to trip me up. I think I'm enjoying it being bright at 5:30 a.m. At suits me. Yeah, it's not easy out of bed. It was good because we were shooting the Vlog. Yes. Yeah, we've been able to actually do some videoing first thing in the morning because it's been bright enough for us to get out about and about and the great thing about shooting a vlog in the mornings is that there's very little people around and I know it shouldn't make a big difference but you you know,  II get I get self-conscious filming people on front of other people. Yeah. I haven't got to that stage where I feel all that comfortable, you know walking into a shop with a camera in front of me, but I'm hoping to get there eventually because I wanted to take our Vlog to different places that's part of my vision, I guess for it is that we get out into art shops and visit framing people and framers. I should say we come visit framers and things like that. So,  Exciting things that could we could do for season 2. Well we're talking about the Vlog and we're assuming that everyone that listens to this podcast Nails. We have one. I know where you started. Sorry, that was could say why? Yeah. So for anyone listening the Vlog has been a bit of a a little bit of a passion project for us over the last couple of months. And what we have been doing is recording these little videos. They're usually anything from about 5 minutes to 15.  In minutes and usually we just decide on the day what we're going to chat about it's very calm and relaxed I guess is the word I'm thinking of not a lot of planning goes into it's on the Fly we did it. So I Vlog is kind of like a blog post in video format. So if you think of the old days of logging when people would just you know post what they're up to the Vlog is a video version of that. So sharing what we're up to in any given week. We know that  Some people the podcast it's just not their thing. It's funny because we listen to so many podcasts you kind of assume that everybody loves podcast, but it took me a while to get into them because I am also a very visual person and you used to listen to them and I'd be like now, I don't think I'd ever get into podcasts but I have not everyone listens to podcast and the Vlog is a fantastic alternative and it has the added benefits of  Being able to see stuff which is very handy when you have an art business because you can show your supplies. You can show your paintings share a little bit of your process. Yeah. So we've become big fans of the Vlog. It's got a bit of a life of its own. I like the Vlog because it's really relaxed and I still get to do my work. Yes, and you've got some certain rules around the Vlog there Unwritten rules because I do I have rows and what are these rows?  No lights, no cables, you know, yeah, I had to come Richie down keep it to one camera, you know unless there's painting if this painting will always do an overhead, but normally we'll just stick to one camera one more week and let's just go where we go all natural light. It's pretty funny because for one of the Vlogs you got a little bit carried away didn't you? Yeah, so it was almost like we were filming an online class because you had said of the Mets down to kind of dampen the sound and had the lights and  and multiple cameras and I walked in and I wasn't impressed. This is a vlog. This is meant to be just super relaxed and for me not having all that stuff the lights the sound proofing and all that. It makes me feel more relaxed. So it gives the Vlog a much more chilled out kind of energy, which I really enjoy. So yes, I have Unwritten rules now to rein you in  And then we have an 11 year old daughter to keeps walking past saying, you know, that's not a vlog. Yes. So we've had the whole debate about what a vlog actually is. So I call it just a video version of a blog post. Yeah, me too. That's what I call a but my daughter is always telling me that a vlog is when you get out and about it's not when you're just in your studio. I reckon going into the studio counts. Yeah. It's outside of the house. Yes. But anyway, so  So she rolls her eyes at us and cringes when we call it a vlog but maybe it's motivating us because we are looking at how we can take it on the road more and have that that kind of energy where you visit places and go kind of stuff you often see on YouTube when you you know watching YouTube videos and you think of those Brave luggers that are out out in shops or cafes and things like that. I don't know. I don't know how we got ourselves into this.  I guess the one thing we have going for us is that there's two of us and I'm filming you. So I guess when people look over there like oh, you know, they're making a video. Yeah. I don't know how to YouTubers do it where they film themselves and they walk around with our camera talking to that camera. Yeah, they're brave people that's true actually because like I've done a bit of filming at local crowd the cafe where I have my work and when you've got kind of a crew or people around you it's not actually so bad, but just doing it on your own would feel better.  Awkward but it's great because it's pushing our skills. And I love a challenge, you know, I love to kind of stretch out my comfort zone bit by a bit and the Vlog is helping me to get better at speaking sharing talking about my work and if any of your audience out there thinking of doing some online classes are getting a podcast. This is like a great way to practice speaking and creating content because the  That you don't use you can put on Instagram. You can take your voice out. And yeah, and you could film a vlog on an iPhone. It doesn't need to be on a fancy camera. I mean the reason that we do it on a camera is because we have cameras we have cameras and your you are a videographer and that way you get to do your craft. So you get the fun of recording it and editing it and doing your thing. So it satisfies both of us creatively, but you could definitely do something like this.  This with an iPhone especially the New York new phones the smart phones that we have today the cameras on them are so good. Oh, yeah, they're amazing unbelievable and and starting like you suggested starting with Instagram Facebook doing a Facebook live. Yeah, those kind of things. What was our first Vlog a studio tour. Oh, we've done all sorts, but the very first Vlog that we did was in the studio and we had just finished putting together a body of work for a new Exhibition at the cafe. Where  Show my work. Yeah, and it was just a random thought we had it all laid out and I thought you know, it'd be cool to share this. Let's do a little video at this point. I didn't even know where we're going to put the video whether we're going to just pop it up on my Facebook page into Instagram or something like that. It was all handheld One camera and I just chatted about the art walked around the studio afterwards I said to you that was really fun. And that was easy. I enjoyed doing that. Let's do some more of those and that's how it started.  Yeah, because it led us to something didn't we didn't know where we were heading with it when we started as I said earlier, it had a bit of a life of its own. So we just started sharing whatever was happening during the week. So that included me getting a big box of art supplies and testing out those suppliers and deciding what I was going to do with them not being too sure. So going out into nature and collecting inspiration. So we did get out and about on that one. I shared a couple of places near where I live.  We live I should say and then I talked about the fact that I was meant to be filming an online class and I was procrastinating and I shared that whole process and I got started with loose layers and eventually it did lead to the new class which I'm excited to say is finally open for registration. So that whole process helped me to develop the abstract Landscapes class that we are about to kind of get into so it's open now for registration.  Tration and then it will start on the 16th of October and we've never done anything like that before where we've shared the I guess the behind-the-scenes of how a class is developed almost the inspiration behind it. So it doesn't really get into the detail of the class. But you just see the Sparks like even shared a couple of books that had inspired me. So I had a painted landscape. I'm not sure. I think it's Amber Cresswell.  He put that book together. And then there's Gypsy by sibella Court like two books that were super inspiring to me in this whole abstract landscape the path that I was following, you know to put together the abstract landscape class, like there were books and things and I like the color palette that yes pied me Tink over the 10 weeks or the sorry, the nine weeks that we filmed the Vlogs you've touched on the substrate that you use the location of the Landscapes that  You're drawing your inspiration from the color palette that you use the books and the inspiration. There's these tiny little hints like that dark lose our most. Yeah, and I even did like a little watercolor painting that was inspired by a landscape. So if you watch the Vlog and I will leave a link to the Vlog. So there's this is the last episode. So the episode that we released today is the last one for season one and we'll talk a little bit about why we're doing seasons in a minute. So there's 10 episodes and old  That in the show notes for this podcast so that if you want to you can watch that journey and find out a little bit more about how we got to where we got to I guess with that with the class and and it's just, you know, little bits and pieces that I think if you're into artsy stuff, you know, there's just something there for everyone. So what's in the class, what's the class of belts? I'm not going to say too much about the class. In fact, I'm going to point people over to I'll leave a link to the class trailer because we put together too.  A video where you can see and I think it's like many things you really want to see a visual don't you with an online class? It's all about the video and how that's put together. So I'd encourage people to go and watch the class trailer and read about the class. But in a nutshell, this is a class about creating loose Landscapes. So very freeing. I'm using a lot of fluid materials. I'm using Fluid acrylics primarily, but I combine that with other mixed media supplies.  Working in layers, very gentle delicate layers. That's enough. Am I saying she might see that's what happens. This is what happens? Okay, so, let me calm down a little bit about the class. How can I say it in one sentence? It's yet loose nature-inspired abstracts. Yeah. They're gorgeous. Yeah going out and you see me going out to various locations and just I guess the interesting part of this class is how is how you take inspiration.  Ation and translate it into something that's quite abstract, you know. So how do you look at color composition Mark baking combine it with your imagination in a way to come up with something that's not necessarily obvious, you know, which is the beauty of abstract. There's that mystery and at all. Yeah. I think I think you say something along the lines of you're painting a feeling. Yes. That's right. And this this class is very much about the feeling. It's a just the materials lend themselves.  2E can't really predict what's going to happen? So there's a there's a freedom there in a letting go and that's what this class is all about. I think the last four or five videos in the course is by far my best work yet. Like I'm very proud of it. Yeah. It is a very visually delicious class. I have to say that it's that's why I want to talk about. So yeah, that's all Richie that's nothing to do with me. I'm very fortunate in that.  That way because Richie does all the all the videos stuff all the editing and puts it all together. But anyway back to the Vlogs. Yes, you're mentioning the season and when we first started doing podcasts you wanted to do it in seasons and I was like no no, no the podcast needs to be every week forever with the Vlogs. I think we both agreed that we give season 1 ago ten episodes and let's see where it took us and here we are.  Release of our last episode of season one and we're going on holidays. And how cool is that? Yeah, I think when we started I really didn't know why we were doing the Vlog and it's not that any everything needs a purpose. But you know most of the time I do think things through and have a reason for doing something but with the Vlog it was just kind of random desire to just do it and because of that I thought well, you know, it's easy to get in.  Enthusiastic about things, you know, you new ideas thought. Well, let's not commit myself to a whole year of these because I wanted to keep it fun. So this is where I've managed to convince you that for this particular Endeavor. Let's do a season of it and do 10 episodes and take a little bit of a break which actually works really well for us because we work in school terms and that's something that we've just had to adapt to because we work from home and our kids are  School and so what we try and do is get most of our work done in their 10-week terms. So they have four terms a year that are roughly 10 weeks. This is actually a fantastic way to work it forces you to think about a 10-week chunk and manage your time. Say manage your time. That's probably the area that we struggle with it because we always bite off a bit more than we can chew. So inevitably it means that the like first few days of the school holidays where usually  Lee trying to scramble and it doesn't take us too far into the school holidays. So we're actually heading away now for a week. We're going to a caravan park with staying with a group of families and having some downtime and as a business owner I've realized that this is super important for me. I I don't know how you feel about this, but I need to book something and actually get out of the house have a holiday if possible even last holidays we booked this.  Time we only went away for three nights, but we still booked a we stayed in an apartment for a few nights just to have that little bit of Separation because when you work from home, you'll work you work in all those cracks when you wish you didn't and it's easy to be working when you could be present your family and your kids and so this is something we just have to do in order to make sure that we're prioritizing our family time. There's something about just getting out of your home environment.  Yeah, and it makes makes you be more productive during the 10 weeks. You know, when I first started with this art business, I was all over the place had no Rhyme or Reason and it's funny because I remember before we start taking the school holidays off. We were talked about patching things. We would talk about like although really intelligent business decisions and we just wouldn't do them. Well now this time around we're starting to do that like we have  The artist interviews which we batch. Yes, we got this course ready in the school term. We got it edited in the school term and now it's releasing while we're away. Yes. We are getting better and we have talked about this on the podcast before many of you may have listened to us chat about wanting to be better planners and the kind of strategies that we were hoping to use we're beginning to do them. So with the artist interviews, so on the podcast we've been chatting with other artists,  It's giving Richie a bit of a break there are not my favorites because I don't have to talk. They're genuinely my favorites because some of the quotes and the lifestyle changes dealing with adversity is super inspiring to me and I get to hear all of these things because I added I absolutely love the artist interviews. Yeah, we love doing them and we've been getting fantastic.  Comments feedback. You guys are really enjoying hearing from other artists and you know, I can totally understand why so we're going to be doing more and more of them and to make that happen. We are sort of batching them up. So I've been using a little planner called calendly, which is knowing. What is it. It's a scheduling app or program. The reason I'm using that is because it helps me with all the time zones because I'm chatting with people from all over the world and what you do.  It's really clever. So if you ever have to do a series of interviews, what you can do is go into your calendar and you can connect it up to your Google calendar and you can let it know when you're available. So you can just give it blocks and it will also make sure that you don't so if you've got something in your Google calendar won't let you double-booked. So you let this program know when you're available and then you send that out to your participants. They get a link with all the different times that they could choose from and then they choose it and you  To get to know what time that is in the time zone where you're at isn't that magic? Yeah. I looked like I was blown away by it. I'm not sure if I've explained it very well, but it's it's called calendly and it's it's definitely made my podcasting life easier. Yeah, it's great. So basically you just send me an email and I get a little calendar tab opens up and I pick my own time. That's right and what it's what it prevents is all that back and forth. What I was Finding was that that part could be quite time.  I'm consuming when are you available? I'm available then does this suit maybe this time all of that is gone now. It's just a click of a button. So I'm feeling very fancy about it all so that's been helpful. And yeah, we've also been dedicating time to the interview. So we had a week recently where we did quite a few interviews in the one week. We're actually ahead of schedule for the first time ever on the podcast, which is very well. We kind of had to be because you're heading away for a few weeks. So that has four  To us in a way, but we have some fantastic interviews coming up on the podcast. So we'll be chatting with Amica whincup an Australian artist who I adore. I'm also chatting with Mary price. So UK artist known as artists in the shed over on Instagram beautiful colorful vibrant work Wonderful chat about all the different things that you can do as an artist or the Avenues. You can explore also chatting with Pamela Bates Pamela is  In the US and we talked about all that one's a great one. I don't want to say too much but it gave me chills because we talked about coming to Art later in life. And and that it's never too late. Yeah. I'm trying to bite my tongue and not say anything on all three because they're just amazing. Yeah one one artist painting her shed. Yeah. She's our she's great another lady lives up. She's from Australia here and  Oh my God, she gets really really honest about heart journey and and Pamela's is just and plus she's married to it and Irishman from from Dublin. Yes had a soft spot for that one because I get to say hello at the very beginning because I do a little sound check. Oh my God, and when we were talking about your artist interviewers are think we're talking about him a couple of days ago. I was saying something along the lines you should do a podcast about the a  Art as podcasts and we just start going through because my idea was to do a little trim in a piece on each ad as podcast. And when we start talking about it, I was like, oh my God, three minutes per podcast wouldn't be enough. That's how we started chatting about it in the car and going through each podcast and the way I often think about it is each one gives you a gift because every time the artist will chat about something or as you say, it might be a quote or something will  In a and shift inside of me with this is what happens to me happens to me and it'll change the way I think or are approach things. I've had conversations that have literally got me out of my chair and into the studio painting because they are that inspiring they make you want to get creative. I mean that is a gift I'll be editing them and then I will text you a quote they are amazing and I feel very blessed and fortunate that I get the opportunity to have these  These conversations it really is a pinch yourself things. Yeah. I've been having a lot of pinch-me moments lately. So very thankful for everyone who's encouraged us. And of course our wonderful guests. Yeah, and you're very approachable. So because I know there's a couple people that have emailed you and said, can I be on your podcast? We do have a way that you can register your interest. We can't have everyone on the podcast. So but we love to hear from you and for you to put forward suggestions. Okay? I think it's time.  Time to wrap up for this week because we are about to head away on holidays. In fact, once we stop recording this. I'm going to start packing our bags before we go. I want to say a huge. Thank you to everyone that listens to our podcast watches our Vlog and sends us lovely comments provides us with feedback and encouragement. We are so appreciative of all of your kind words. So this week's episode of the Vlog is the last four season 1 and includes a sneak peek of our brand-new.  New class abstract Landscapes. So I hope that you enjoy that and we're about to head off as I said on holidays. So next week we'll be having an artist interview. I am chatting with Anika whincup. This is a must listen for all artists but enough from me. I hope that you enjoyed this episode and that you tune in again next week.	Recording podcasts.  Filming vlogs.  Making online classes.  Just a few of the things that you ll find us doing on any given week.  In this episode, we chat about why we love taking on these kinds of creative endeavours.  We also talk about the different ways that we batch our work so that we can fit it all in and still have some down-time! 
spotify:episode:1aAm12OYJQNrn2HRrt0bsm	First day of the Gold Cup, this is Gold Cup daily. I'm Lisa Vasquez and joined by Miss. Amy Lopez says that is my soul. And for the first time in the Gold Club daily as called Gold Cup daily. Mr. I'm just gonna go ahead and reduce yourself. What do we have in front of us today? Alrighty. Well, my name is Ivan Pineda host of The Eagle Eye podcaster Ivan. Welcome to the Gold Cup daily. Well, well, thank you. Thank you for having me. All right. Well first we're going to Start and the first question I have is for mr. Cecil looked at in the room. If all of you guys are which all in an attempt to all of you guys always do and look at Cessnas players rating after every Mexico game sets are for the very first time in the history of the player ratings for ESPN FC gave someone a 10 so we're just going to address that right now. That's not a yeah. Hello a 10. Yeah all the lights turned off and now there's just ask people like he's great. People are now looking at us right now people.  We're at the workroom in the bottom of the stadium and we're recording this but we're first going to have to go ahead and say okay. Here's the thing. It could have been any player but he was at the right place at the right time. It could have been Jimenez. It could have been Alvarado it could have been for all I know it could have been Diego Draya's you're just out there off like corners or set pieces. But until he should be given credit three goals and assist you gotta give the guy credit for that. Okay, like I feel like the car is the fact that Amy there is a one performance at everyone.  And it happened twenty four two guys a second game in the World Cup vs. Brazil where Ochoa had best, you know performances by keeper not only a mixing Keeper in the history of the game people still reference that name are saved and he got a nine point five. So we're here to settle a score why I'm doing I got a 10 score. It's just like look.  Right now than me. If anybody tries to claim it, you're Liars just another by yourself. All right, guys. Well Ivan's over here going what have I gotten myself into I'm just questioning. Why not in the love it?  I think it's I think because there were mostly goals one is true, but they weren't like the one goal of those. I feel like he was always a happy day it is and now they don't have to stick with him, you know, ironically enough. This is where I think a 9.5 happens trust me. He's doing his job. Yeah, which is the score of the goals. He's doing his job. Yeah and stuff he's doing it well, but again, it's the  the circumstances. I mean I said that this was a game where he could be highlighted specifically because he has Pace but you're a little sloppy on the ball when he hears it but this is kind of the play the game where he could polish all of that. Yeah, and so I don't think that he was perfect. Well sadly, I can't give point five. So it's either now. I know you can wait you can't give it you gotta round up. So we finally settled it.  Because I did because I was doing my player because I says look at and that's where I think the 10 is kind of going into what that the side of a dumb boy on so it's kind of like the every little thing like they're still pretty young give him a chance. If he doesn't if it doesn't do well for the rest of the Gold Cup, like obviously like he's just put all right. Okay, there went to play writing our intro went a little too long. You guys are mostly wondering why mr. Tom Marshall is not here today. Well he is hard.  At work behind us and he's making a face. He doesn't want to acknowledge this right now, so he's out there. But so we're going to go ahead continue as Mexico 7-0. It was expected as everyone thought we were all counting. How many goals I said 6ss. I think you said 7 1 or 6 1 I thought five I thought by five less Amy. Were you about five? I said 13 13  So, why did you think this is real that it won't I welcome to there was there were there there was two two ways. I saw this game going. It was either gonna be a go-fast which we got or it was going to be one of those games in which the Mexican national team got chances but struggle to put the ball into the back then yeah, which I had moments if periods of the game where we were just only 1 1 mil up it seemed like it was going to be let's be fair. We've seen those kind of games in the past before to against concacaf opponents. Yeah, but you don't see them at that table who still hasn't had a single game. That's under 3  Will be true that is very very true. I saw that first 90 seconds and then they scored so for me it was going to be some kind of goal. We just saw from what that that was saying in the press conference before and we talked about it yesterday in the in this pod where Theta is there to make a statement that I was going to go guns blazing that that is, you know said that in the press conference, he wasn't going to let the gas out because it respected Cuba and you're going to keep playing which is kind of this whole controversy that people keep talking about, you know, the 13-0 why stop and we're going on I'm coming out of it as not only a win.  It 7-0, but the fact that no one was injured. Yes. I think that was definitely think that was in my mind. I use the gift of the of the coaches running and hugging each other because that's how I felt but let's talk about the press conference has taught the saying I think the quote of the night someone asked him, you know, what advice you would give the player that we're all talking about in the first, you know, five minutes of this pod and interesting thought that did say, you know II really don't go on social media. Don't get you.  You know, they'll get happen at the end of that quote. He said look at my player. Oh my gosh, there it is. But one of the things that he did say at the end of that quote was kind of like looked at a media kind of smiled, you know, you know, you shouldn't that word in flower right? You shouldn't Elevate him to a level because this is a long tournament. And yeah that is so I kind of like that about that the already kind of telling everybody paste that yeah, what else thought that stage during the Press coverage, but that's like I'm interested like what else stood out to you guys will press conference just because that was something that I completely missed out on so I was there. He said, you know, we  Can't really take a lot from this one because it's a 7-0. It's one of those it's a win and it's great way to start a tournament. You always want to start with the right foot forward with the wind, but we also have to know that the the opponent wasn't, you know, an opponent that we face and that's something that kind of stood out also because you know a coach would it be like, yeah. Let me let me take this and start analyzing these players and who did right or who didn't I think it just taken it a step at a time with this type of window. So I mean, I'm glad  it took it that way because I think a manager could also be like very excited Bob lot. Maybe be a little over the top but I think it's good to be at least for managerial sensor be like kind of conservative and recognize that it was a seven nothing win over Cuba. I think this is something to keep in mind something like this probably isn't gonna happen against Canada and the next game like I doubt it's going to be guys. I really think that they're going to everyone keeps saying the candidate might lose points ice Canada today didn't impress me like everything went for nothing. So, yeah, so I don't know maybe can't really take the grant special you look at communicating.  Roster to like I've haven't really paid much attention to but we look at the roster and seems like they have like some pretty interesting talent in there. I just think that we were able to beat South American teams three four goals and maybe they weren't a hundred percent but they're getting ready for for the Kremlin wall. And now comes the Canada which I don't think I saw like that Ivan to you anything negative like something that if you got any nitpick at this win, maybe you know something that you're like, I wish I would have saw or anything that I'm not end. I mean if we're being really picky about situations, I think  the fact that our main Striker document has had a couple of chances in which he could have easily walked away with five goals the but you know didn't didn't actually end up getting getting himself on the scoresheet as much, you know, two goals. He has granted it is it is great. But you know, there was a chance where he just sculpted in front of go, you know, and this is a one-on-one also. It was a one-on-one. We had a heavy touch and you know, it's kind of key moments like that in which you wonder you know  You have to be the number nine, you know, you know, this is your time to kind of take the step forward and say, you know, I'm the future number 9 for the for for this world cup process and you know, if we're being nitpicky about it, I would I would have wanted him to get at least a couple more girls be more refined in these final moments because it is like you said it is against Cuba it would imagine these situations which is probably going to be the easiest. If not the easiest thing he's going to have to do in this in this tournament obviously going to have more teeth as well. But you know,  It's these moments of what you think. Okay. We're all you really need to kind of be a hundred percent going into this game and to miss chances like that, you know granted I guess maybe could have been one of those games where as well. You know, it's an easy one. So, you know, you can get more chances are it doesn't matter whether or not you put the ball in the back of the net but I would imagine, you know, like I said nitpicky about this it would have been role being a little bit more clinical. Yeah, not that we could go on a nitpicky but one of the things that I noticed and I mean to you is I didn't see it.  Clear domination in the goals. It wasn't a colossal from outside. They were all mostly tappings after a rebound. I know we shouldn't be that nitpicky. But if there's a constantly nitpicking no, but what I what I wanted to see was can we go from one side of the other and score a goal, you know with like passing and going over the our opponent not just, you know, a tap-in after after hit I would like to see if we're going to do that. Why not against Cuba  I mean that's kind of true but I think something that you see me differently with this team under thought that is like just as much as they go back and I think you saw it against Paraguay and then you saw it again and I'm sorry not paragraph Was it Venezuela and stuff like that will back up and they'll try to recover the ball as much as possible do the same thing. And yeah, they're ugly goals, but we've seen Mexico also - ugly goals in the past and not get seven zero results. I mean, I've been just said it himself there was hesitant about thinking that Mexico's able  When with a lot of goals because they haven't been there. They have played games against a team like you when only one like to zero. Hello. This is such like a Mexican soccer fan like conversations like yeah, we won but goals are ugly like to see like a good kind of what was that goal that was like 25 touches, you know, like that's the type of thing I would like to see is  The same time it's a good win against weaker team and concacaf before and gold cups before and they've tied Guatemala's and turn into Legos and and not saying cubers like that. But it's like just like that to said the best thing is starting with the right foot and winning the most poorly they did what they needed to do. Yeah. It was whether it be three nothing or seven of them they did what they needed to do and there were no injuries. So I'm happy with that. I will add to that the team looked well, you know, they move the ball around very well. Did they  They understood what that they wanted them to do. It's just no way. It's just like you said you would go back to the the nitpicky about is yeah, they are ugly goals in a sense because they're not, you know, you know 20 yards out, you know placed in the top corner, but it's still saw the ball being worked around very well clear attacking identity. There's definitely a clear attack identity with that four three, three two fullbacks pushing up. There's a lot of focus on the wings. I want to overlap in runs lot to pass this. Oh, no, I definitely agree with that. Yeah. He's laughing.  I think he's laughing because he's not here, but I just think it's kind of funny that we're gonna have four goals today and in the mix Zone like always which is where I get angry the fact that only five players are allowed to speak to the media and I think there was a catalyst on sale. Alex is vague, but it wasn't really anything.  I mean the fact that you again everyone kind of regurgitating that you know, not to take this win, as you know, something magical but at the same time it's a good start for everybody. So there wasn't anything big sigh time. But as part of that although I would love to asking about his 89th game his 10th goal 10 goals that he has but he ran past me and I wasn't allowed so I'm a little bit around that what do we expect for Mexico? They leave tomorrow on a flight at 3 p.m. And fly to  Denver to the altitude I think continuing, you know, I think the recovers of the injuries in the games that are that are coming up with you no more and no there wasn't really any updates as far as injuries will say that so what else are you guys? What are the other story as we have after the game? It's definitely the injuries to see about the status of Edson Alvarez. Like you said Morano as well to see how the team are those plenty several. Yeah, John Dos Santos to Pizarro because those are dumb up gently some players. You want to see on the field, especially some like these are all right thing has been probably  Most impressive player to me him and Charlie Rodriguez so far under thought the matheno. So yeah be interesting to see the status of those players. All right. Well, thank you to I've interesting I know he's about to leave and then we just pulled them over like nobody give a little shout out to the second now, right? So yeah, so we're still DUI podcast you guys can still Catch Us on Tuesdays Live on YouTube, but we do have a new home in which we are now going.

I'm actually gonna put this out in my carry-on so that he doesn't he can do anything. No one told me about this. That's no one's no one's what I guess. That's our bag. We'll figure it out.

Herds is back going on everybody jump over here with Adam Kaplan and a lots to get into today. We've got another quarterback injury for the birds. We've got some players to evaluate from the preseason opener. And of course, it wouldn't be an eagles training camp without an in Camp Trade right Adam. Yes. Yes. The Eagles did make a trade for Eli Harold they cut or they traded Ryan Bates who probably would have been the first cut if they had to get down to 75 Jeff. So right I'm he was an undrafted free agent. Anyway out of Penn State who just did not  Do anything and they were hoping if he would have performed you could been a practice squad player, but nevertheless Lots going on here. You know, I'm in Jacksonville Jeff as we speak here. That's right, Jack. The Jaguars have 15 players are unable to practice. So the Eagles were not the only team that's going through injury issues man. Well, let's talk about the big one because I think there's Widespread Panic All Over the Delaware Valley with Nate's unfilled having a left wrist fracture. And then what did the Eagles do from here? And you've heard all the you know, the the names out there and McCown Colin  Pretty cool my God, they have to sign somebody now they came to into the season with Club with with Andrew coated cast. No Trudy Kessler Kessler. I'm getting confused with Andrew Kessler. I think is Agent, but correct and they're not related and they're not related. Right? Right. Let's all shout out to Andrew there. But uh, yeah. No Cody Kessler as the number two guy. I think the big thing we all have to do is kind of just collectively take a sigh or a breath of fresh air here. They've got still about  two weeks of training camp to go and if this is only a six to eight-week injury is probably not going to be that big of an issue this maybe even being non issue at all Adam. Yeah, so he should be back with twins weeks three and five with with wrist fractures as long as our and there are no complications, especially because it's it's son Felts non-throwing wrist. It's his left wrist. I mean, it wouldn't ship would not surprise me if he comes back within that the fact if it really heals well, maybe throws lightly or will they let him throw because it's not  Is Right risk may be the 11th start throwing a week 5 who knows but decision was made that they were in a not going to put on any reserve list is he was going to come back fairly early and that's really the reason why they're not going to sign a quarterback. Why would you why would you sign a veteran and by the way if the guys on if he's not plaid for termination pay he could you're going to guarantee his contract for beyond the the Roth week one roster. He so why start a veteran like Brock Osweiler or any of those journeyman? Why not just go someone has  been with the team the whole offseason. Now you Cody Kessler you and I have talked about me doesn't throw the ball very, well. He's not real big physically 6 1 2 tenths of an inch moves. Okay, but thing is he knows their offense will execute it. Well Clayton Forrester does not ready. He didn't abominable game personal Source Who watch the tape said look like the moon was too big for him. Like he just was not ready mentally for it. The hope is Jeff and in the second game. He gets all the Jitters he was  Clearly nervous there. He was tight. You could say whatever you want and saying it shouldn't happen. But he was he's a rookie right first NFL game. He struggled mightily. He was let's call it. He was terrible. Yeah. No, no doubt about it. We weren't expecting that. Yeah. Well, we'll talk about that a little bit. But obviously the accuracy you would think was the the in accuracy was because he was a little bit jittery out there. So we'll have to if you can I guess in some sensors at least there's a reason for it and it's not just that maybe he's a  Louisville quarterback and it was terrible evaluation, right? So what we will get it to him a little bit. I guess the only argument to be made that I've heard that makes a little sense is that you want if you're gonna not if you don't want Kessler to be your top back up and maybe your quarterback who if Carson Wentz for to get hurt signing someone now lets you get into camp and gives you a two or three weeks to get a familiar with the offense or anything like that. But I look at it and say if they're going to sign a quarterback, it's going to be somebody who's probably familiar with their offense and it may be even some  Is caught you know, maybe gets cut closer to cut down day or at cut down to anyway, so I understand what people are saying, but I still think it's a little bit like a too much of a five-alarm fire right now. Yeah and Josh Johnson wasn't that I had mentioned on Twitter that that's probably something that could have looked at be some of the Lions and he does have he does know the West Coast terminology because he played in with teams that guys played every offense. Yeah, exactly exactly. That's exactly it, but they decided not to be passed on.  Him, I'm told so Doug at his word was was corrected want to go with these guys and week to the preseason. You could expect who's got to split the snaps. What kind of evaluation in you talking to your people did son fell get before he left with an injury. He obviously had the really nice bum to Mark em, Michelle. Yes, he played well, but he did miss a couple throws early fact the past behind goddard's back. I mean he did he throw to the wrong shoulder was behind ghadir. Yeah. There was wondering  Over the middle, right? He just a little bit too strong, but after that he really he was very accurate overall. He was good. Now the the the 40 yard pass and then the the the 35 yard run by Michelle that pass was a touch pass. Now if you've seen a subfield fro, he's got a power arm very good on very big arm. Yeah, ten times bigger than Kessler's I mean, it's just he's got a good arm. He's got good size. Yeah, the promise of felt is an  talk about this. He needs the raps. I mean, he's a guy that very inconsistent in Camp and we're putting it mildly right he needed these last three weeks of reps and unfortunately, he's not going to get them. I think that's that's a concern because if someone has to play this season, he'll have missed out on at least three weeks of work of putting work and training camp and preseason. Yeah. It's kind of fun. It's a little bit of how Nick Foles, you know, missed a lot of that time in 2017. Everybody was worried about how it was gonna play the elbow.  The Super Bowl so it'll be interesting to kind of see with all this Miss time what that does for son felt. I agree. He is the type of guy who probably needs as many reps as you can get obviously not unlike Nick. He's not been a starter somewhere. So it's just not like riding a bike for him. So this will be a little bit of a setback for him and we'll just see how long it takes. But you bring up kind of when we talk about the quarterbacks and injuries. They're almost indirectly related in that lane. Johnson is now going to be out for a little bit and  It raises the question. Will do you play Carson Wentz now with one of his best protectors who's going to be out for a little bit? Yes. Oh Jeff Lane soccer play the in the preseason. I'm told not going to be an issue for Week 1 I can he stay Eagles will actually put out an injury report. How about that? They about that I could say they had so many and good for the pr staff to do this. Really I'm glad that they did that for us her sacrum and staff deserves credit because I know that dogs been reluctant to do it, but you know what this does is this  Not going to ask any questions if you just put it out there. This is what doug did your one no more questions. You could just get into football. So those actually smart move. Yeah. So let's the dress just quickly to me. You don't put Anna and and I know that Jordan Jordan my lot of played really well in the this preseason game. I'm very surprised because remember the tides came in with a lot of defensive starters in the lineup. I was actually with the Titans on Saturday. They review their tape they were really happy with their their first units that  At the start is at play there very happy but enjoyed my lot of he definitely played. Well, there's no question based on my sources who watch the tape. However, are you going to really put him out there to be their starting right tackle in let's say the third week of the preseason want to really mean something really he's probably gonna he's gonna be out there for a quarter or a half. I that to me is very risky, but and they don't want to move on dreidel or to right tackle that it has. Well as he played in the opener. They are married to the idea that you have practicing and left tackle. So it does leave them kind of in a situation.  To figure out. Well, how much are we going to play cards and whines if at all if he's not even going to have Lain Johnson out there and maybe not even Jason Peters out there because Peters doesn't really play that much in the preseason. So do you think that we won't see Carson Wentz I haven't asked yet, but I just know that dealing with teams over the years that are very reluctant to play with backup tackles and really backup players with the starting unit. They just team coaches don't like doing that because a risky be definitely worked a lot together because they're getting they're going to get  Work in practice and training camp there the it to a certain extent. I mean, they're not going to get very many with the first team. But here's the other thing with Brandon Brooks not ready at though. I'm told he's getting very close. That's great. So, yeah, but again, we don't know it's not decided when he'll start practicing it. I have not been able to get that exactly exactly. I'm sure I know more than sweet but think about it now. So if I tie is the Right Guard now if Brandon had been coming back in the next two weeks, then you could consider just  Putting big V left tackle because he's done it before she's been right up. Right - yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, we'll have to see I mean you want guys to get reps. They that I always I say the preseason is is important from knocking rust. I think it's hard to go play an NFL game at that speed when you've played 0 preseason snap. Some people say it doesn't matter at all and I would disagree with that. I think you know, it's anytime you do something at the pace of an NFL game in the speed that  Anything that can prepare you for it, even if it's just a little bit is better than nothing now granted some quarterbacks. You just don't want to take that risk and I get it but in general, I think I think it's important to play some like you'll see like on Sports Talk Radio should players have preseason just pieces of matter word should every all the starters not play the first teams that you know starts and I say, I think you got it. It's important. It's not completely dismissible. Yeah. You look go.  Back to Donovan McNabb and I I'll never forget this and I still to this day never got an explanation any re put it Donovan. I might have been the year after that. He keep he broke his ankle was a sewer towards a see. I don't remember what year it was. But what would have been probably the ACLU because I was a season Ender he I'm not joking. I think he played him for one snap and took him out something like yeah, it's ridiculous some like what know why even put them out there. What's the yeah one snap doesn't do anything.  Please tell me won't one good series as soon as we get the good series of could be the first and they're all out. Yeah, that would be fine to me. But I would rather the starters be in there. You really have to be careful right of playing guys who have not gotten any work with the first team reps or very little that that's a problem. Sure. Let's move on to some player valuations because you obviously spent some time talking to some people and you have some really, you know, I think to the naked eye you and I anybody watching can say hey Audrey Diller play well or this person, you know Market until quite a nice pass, but give me something  Insider e that stood out in your conversations, I will start with the offensive line of the big stories Andre Dillard you and I talked in the offseason. We are concerned that the lack of functional strength he was way behind in hand usage because this is all new to him client went three point stance and bright light is gone on the last two weeks, which we've outlined on our show and this game his athleticism and he's footwork and his movement were Auto flew away. Yeah, so really naturally fluid  Apparently the scouts that I talked to her at the Senior Bowl were blown away by them, but they did all say to me. Look. He's not the strongest guy. He needs to be in the weight room for your hopefully you won't have to play and I will see the Eagles are hoping that Peters plays all 16 games and he's a year over well over a year from removed from the ACL. So he looks good, by the way, I mean not that he's playing right now, but he's had a very good camp, but getting back to dealer looks look the part didn't ask him to a lot in the Run game, but he's getting the footwork down.  And the Hand usage in technique or where they where it needs to be and it was not the case in OT as where he struggled mightily and I've kind of learned my lesson the hard way not to to over evaluate OTAs, especially with players are being asked to do things. They've never done before because he's he's at this level you're going to run the ball a lot more. You know, right College show. Yeah. He looked he looked exceptional. I few hundred. Oh I and I hope as the preseason goes on a little  a bit that we see some more intentional just power type run just just to get get a glimpse of how he does when he's got, you know, two hands on the ground and when going right now that you know, a maybe a like a seven techniques and were lined up right across from him, you know some power football or even even Zone run where he's uncovered a maybe launches into the second level to get on Allah line back. I want to see that kind of athleticism transform. I want to see a parlance of the running game of because I already we already knew about the past Pro that we figured that was going to  Area even though he struggled early in Camp that he would naturally catch up to well speaking of catching up Jordan. My lot of the big issue with him is going from the left to the right side. He didn't take to it real well on the start training camp. He was probably if we graded them if we were able to get people to tell us who's probably of the eleven who are going to make the team 10 or 11. He was probably one of the lowest greater ones along with Matt prior, but he is really taken to the techniques better and it all showed up in this game.  He had by the way in this game. He had not shown this before this kind of Competency. You know, I don't have an explanation for it just happened. This is what he did last year. He really came alive during the games. Yeah. This is I was talking to someone the Jaguars today who is a Personnel department. They were you know, they like many  Tommy he's the one guy says look when you talk about a rugby player. It's you don't know what you're getting because it's yes it's a physical game, but you're not blocking the way that you block and Rugby's completely different here. Yes, you have to use your body in your arms, but the technique is completely different and then when you from a metal stick and point Jeff when you asked him go from the left to the right side, that's another position. You gotta learn like this kid. This kid is incorrect 23 years old. Are you see? I mean, I think he's got everybody can't  It's about his capacity and potential and and what he can do if he has to play or when he'll play just amazing six-foot amazing. All right body fat unbelievable it so how about Lyme bags out of anything the linebackers. I thought to me to my naked eye Singleton seem to stand out as far as being around the ball be active, you know making plays from sideline to sideline. Yeah exact Brown was tremendous in the Run game to people who greeted tape so that he was exactly what they were hoping for a downhill.  Run stopper Nick Gary really good in coverage executes well in coverage when he has to do it for some good some could be better look right now as I've said from day one after the after the combo grugier-hill injury, which is going to keep him out. Why as we know for a bit? Will you really look at this thing? They've got four linebackers that could really use right now if the season started today and and you know kimono you just hope that with  You know a great a Grade Three MCL could be as many as 10 weeks. I mean, it's typically it's typically between six and eight. It's the injury that Evan Mathis had Evan Evan told me years ago. He was in tremendous pain when he came back, but he you know, he graded it and toughed it out. So they're going to miss Camus a minimum of the first couple weeks. I would say probably least the first three weeks and Gary's going to have a pretty big part because he can cover and he can execute that part but against the Run  He almost has no chance because he's so small. Right, right. All right, anyone else stand out in your convert? Yeah. Yeah, the result Douglas was pretty much graded out perfectly whenever he was thrown to he had the receiver guarded like he with his luck with his lens. Mmm, as I said before. I know Darby's bat doing more than he was but couple weeks ago.  It's going to take the only way that Dart the that that rissoles not starting is if they give somebody a starting job without our knowing it. I mean Douglas I've come around on them with first year was not very good last year when he was supposed to be the fifth corner. He had a start as we know he came on a little bit as we discussed last year on our show and now he's been their best cornerback in training camp. Maddox obviously is very very good. And yeah, it's his chance, but we're still Douglas you can make the argument if you talk to the right people.  Been their best player in the offseason. We're going to have to take offence on defense deeper dive into the whole Corner situation. Maybe not next week, maybe two more weeks when this thing really starts to around into form because we have to still see how Sydney plays and Avante place because all season in leading up to Camp you and I discussed will what happens if Sydney Jones are Avante. Maddox is better. What do you do with Jaylin bills? And we didn't. Yeah, we did not talk about rasul Douglas. We also assumed and I don't think we're full.  So that at some point in time this was gonna be back but now it's looking like it could be longer and even with Darby who's just now starting to practice a little bit, you know, yeah, maybe rasul Douglas starts because a he's earned it and because two guys who you have thought we're going to start aren't even going to be healthy enough to play. So there's a lot to the process there. We just have to let some weeks go by and see as others get healthy what happens exactly, right? And then Josh sweat very very good. I need to mention because he's been our guy for luxurious doing a half months. He put it together very good technique.  He went against Taylor the one who had to play because he's suspended four games to they're trying to get him time. Right and I guess the functional strength part of it is about three times better than I was last time this year. He was a little bit I want to say thin but he was not filled out like he is now and just 15 pounds of muscle looks terrific. His technique is really good. He's knows what he's doing. They shot Hall was the surprise though. He had really been a disappointment for the Eagles. Yeah. He really lived up. I was always smoke.  He was shot out of a cannon. I mean that's that's what this come from. Maybe you guys are feeling the urgency. Now Joe, you know, well, I think you know, whenever you start to practice or play against people who are not your own teammates after two weeks. You just get it rekindle something in you I guys talking about that all the time they just and we'll see you in a week or so when when they do the joint practices with the Ravens. They any time you watch a joint practice and you know Adam that there's just so much more intensity and urgency out there on the field when it's somebody other than your teammate that you've been hitting her not even allowed to hit really hard for  Two weeks, you know, right which and then see if there's anyone else had defense. Not really. I do want to mention on offense a couple guys that I thought help them will not help this us before Dallas got it got hurt. You should have for captured by the way the same one. It's just you. He not the exact Earth can't do this stuff. But Goddard is so big physically. It's a very huge safety cannot cover me. You're not going to do that. You're going to have to get it.  Corner or linebacker on immunity too damn big and it's got to be a corner as long like Russel Douglas. So he's going to be a major factor and we do want to mention the other guys Mark and Michelle who yeah, if you're a great if you're grading 90 players, he's in terms of training camp performance and plus this one game. He's in the top 20. Well, that's something and I mean, this is so nice older brother mean he's bounced around a little bit. This is this is there's room in a great story.  This is a great there's room we've talked about how there's room to make this team as a fifth and maybe six receiver depending if they want to do that and go heavy there. But certainly he's a guy who with that speed and the ability to Parlay it into special teams as well as anything. He might do for the offense that that's that's a that's you know, you look at all the receivers the Eagles have kind of battling for these spots. Some are big strong guys like a Charles Johnson who's also fast, but some are like Braxton Miller were great warriors.  Or they're kind of these versatile slot guys, but Michelle has this that probably the best speed out of all of them. So that might give him a leg up here everything they've asked him to do. He's done it. He's answered the bell every single time. You know, Matt Collins bat is backed by the way fully knock on wood bar. Yeah, I was gonna say not to do it back. Yes. Oh look.  This I know score wasn't ideal. But look this Titans played a lot of starters Eagles basically didn't play any you know, it really just rested just about everybody so we'll see what they do in week two, but nevertheless there's there were some good stories here that don't let the score full either a lot of good stories in this game. Yes real quick before we wrap this up. I want them to talk about the trade. We mentioned it a little bit trading Eli Harold for Ryan Bates. Bates will have an opportunity to make the bills if you can they have all sorts of offenses.  Mine injuries, but Eli Harold is do you see him as can't body or because he's been in the league and was what like a third-round pick several years ago has maybe a little bit of a I don't say a leg up but has maybe a better than average chance of Ghana pilfering that job away from so I would think that it's still just sweat type of job to lose and it is for Eli Harold to win. Yes. Oh, so I talked to coaching Source who work with them and one of us stops and said that when he came in,  He was strictly going to be looked at as a 34 outside linebacker Chris. He's long. He's 6 foot 3 3333 in charms, really really struggled with technique. He was very raw. He he clearly was just an athlete coming out of college. I'm pretty by the way a very high character kit good kid, but we so raw and never performed for the Niners. He played DN and strong side linebacker for the Lions. This coaching Soros said that  So if you're going to play mat end, he's probably going to need to get a Little Bit Stronger because he's somewhere up to 45 it 6-3, which is a little bit light. Maybe maybe it's is outside linebacker more like it. He's got an outside linebackers body, but he did play he played with his hand out in college at UVA. So he's he's gonna have a chance here. He was a guy that was I don't see was overdrafted because he was supposed to go in the second or third round and he went in the third so he'll have a chance. Look Sharif Miller, although he had a  Really nice place in this game. He's a long ways away from ever. He won't play the season at all if he's on the roster, which you should be. He probably won't dress to see metabolic. He's there. He's been on like a teens. He's 30 years old and we mentioned Hall, you know of any Curry of course and Josh wet. So they're going to just throw competition should just some enough for with Eli Harold. I mean, I still figuring to keep 11 defensive line in which is a lot hmm. I don't see - day Shaun Hall making it although he played he's going to have to  tear it up and weeks two and three probably for as well to make it but that's where if they keep 60 fensive ends. That's really what do you worry? Because we know that sweat and Courier locks, it's your assuming they're going to keep Sharif Miller because he's drafty and then if you're going to keep six because Joe Osmond is gone. It's either going to be hall or Harrell, right? So yeah, we'll see how that shapes up a over camp, but I think you hit on the head. There's the depth there is going to be so  Right now that it's going to be difficult for him to make that team. So we'll have to you know, see how it plays out and see who stays healthy over the next few weeks. You're who are in Jacksonville right now, the birds are actually headed your way. Although I've trained ready for you're getting out of there what today? Yeah, actually no, I'm going to be here and what we're taping this on a Sunday. I'll be here Monday as well. Alright, okay, and they'll be a head down there for their previous crease in the game. Yes. Yes, and they play Thursday. It's a situation where the Jaguars they sit up to about four or five days.  Ago were relatively healthy. Now. They've got 15 players who were injured. It's crazy. They against the Ravens in practice apparel.  You were very good. But in the game they struggled because a lot of starters didn't play because they're hurt. They're they've got a minimum of two offensive line starters out. They've got to start a receiver who's out there. Very later running back. They're not going to backup quarterback defensively. They've got a bunch of guys hurt. It's just it's going to be tough. So the Eagles will play in Jacksonville this week, they'll depending on who they want to use their going to have they'll be they'll be able to get things done. But I think in the end when we just sum this up for  The eagles they learn a lot in this game about their backups again. Don't let the score full you. Yes their backups who had to play against the Titans first offensive unit. Didn't fare all too. Well, although I think Joshua had held his own against chalawan, but you that's what you expect. Your hope is the backups will have to play as much against the ones that they'll they'll just when you in terms of when you need a breather. Yes, you could put them in doing a during the regular season and hopefully hold up, but your hope they don't have to play.  Out of minutes because that's when that's when matchups are a little bit tougher for them. Right? Right and we'll talk about it again next week after the Jack's team you and I will do this and we'll give you player evaluations and we'll go through who stood out who didn't hopefully there won't be any major injuries and will say maybe there'll be another trade knowing how way between us. All right, that'll do it for inside the birds the leading podcast if Eagles tell intelligence check for Adam Kaplan, I'm Jeff moisture, as always. We appreciate our listeners and we thank you for flying with us inside.  Hide the burns.

spotify:episode:4MjU516jPJacKKv6NilTGL	Kane is in the building. Balaji bro fly Hollygrove chicks to my Hollywood shows and I wanna tell you something that you probably should notice that Slumdog Millionaire Bollywood flowing on recognize that voice morning's never hear from me later Mia Drake on there and we got Lil Wayne. I like your song. It kind of bugged me a little bit that they use it for the TV.  Show Ballers. Okay, because I feel like it Waters it down a little bit. I feel like the reason you put this on for the podcast today was because we gave you a hard time about not knowing what the best rap songs were when we did that list on the air. Yeah. Well that list is garbage by the way, and I'm pretty sure you said this was your favorite song It's a my top 10. I don't really have a top like an actual order to my top 10 but I love this song. I like Lil Wayne a lot. Is this like your in your top ten rap songs are your top?  Songs of all time top 10 rap songs, but I do like this song that with you my top 10 rap songs. I don't really have it though. That's what I'm saying. I'm just saying like this would probably be in the top 10 if I was thinking about it. Okay, you know, I like Lil Wayne's collaborations with Eminem as well as find that's a nice pairing between the two if I hear Lil Wayne A Millie, come on. I can't I can't turn the station no matter what station is on Millie. Let me see if I can find.  Dead come on, of course, I do right here. I got it. It's on my top. Ten list. This is my kind of rap song what you like.  Little little little like deep heavy baby and knowing or Jam. Yeah Medtronic my Millionaire on my Young Money Millionaires of my generation are my what was the song that they said was the greatest rap song of all time Avis ridiculous because they were all super old songs and they were all influential in their time. But when you add up all the songs, there are in the  The world I bet you the like fight all the top five that we went through are barely getting play Grandmaster Flash was a lot of founding fathers of rap. But the the number one song. They said of all time was juicy by Big E. Hmm. That one's still getting played quite a bit. Yeah. Yeah, and I have apparently I'm the only person who had never really liked I wouldn't have been able to tell you the name of that song.  Just and I think it's mostly because I only got into hip-hop and rap or whatever, you know in the last 10 years. I didn't grow up with it. You got a lot of music to go through the I know I like those documentaries that play on HBO every now and then they have like the series where they look at the origins of rap music totally. It's kind of cool just to get a brief history of all that just like it's cool to get a brief history of any music.  Genre, like you know, when I first started working for an oldies radio station when I was in Regina, you were working for an oldies radios. Well, there were two stations in the building. There was CJ me Regina is best oldies and then I was on like z-99 today's best music. I was working back and forth and I didn't know any of the oldies songs, but then I was they gave me some stuff to watch the material to go through. Okay learning about you know, why all these  Are so significant and cool, you know how like the evolution of rock and roll is essentially? Yeah through artists like Elvis Presley and the Beatles and you know, British Invasion stuff. So that was interesting when I started working and radio. I was working at a classic rock station as you know, because that's when we are careers cross paths many years ago. Yeah. I love this story. You know, which one you're going to tell I used to screw up. I was like 20 and I was working at a classic rock station is used to screw up the names all the time.  Time if there's Bruce cockburn and if a tree falls in the forest or a soggy, I remember there's a song called In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida and it was like one word In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida and I remember seeing that going like what what is this in the god? The the man got out of Eden? Maybe I know that song. There's another oh, there's the Jimi Hendrix who do chilly actually pronounced Voodoo Child. Yeah, but I it's spelled  Voodoo, Chile. Yeah. Okay. What's the girl T to do that's around the time that they switched me to the top 40 station gotta get this girl off the stage and blowing her credibility. Yeah Classic Rock Fans. I worked at a classic rock station as well. And I found that classic rock fans are the absolute like I don't want to say worse. But like if you if you mess something up. Oh, yeah, if you like a song like Strawberry Fields by The Beatles, I knew I don't know how many  He hops in the in the building. That would not song was playing. There's a there's a part of the song where it fades down. Yeah Fades back up. Yeah. I don't know how many hops like cut the song This song there. Yeah, just get over phone calls and text messages. What's wrong with you Helter Skelter from the Beatles. Does that as well? It fades out about 45 seconds before the song actually ends, then it fades back in learned that one the hard way. I remember after the chili is it?  I decided that I would answer every single phone call and I took that would have been great radio if I put all that on the air because I just it would have been great. You know that beat to shreds. Oh, I mean the phone's kept ringing for like 45 minutes after tell your DJ the cheese a dumbass. Yeah, that's me that's been talking to her. A lot of people think it's like I talk radio station where you're going to call in and you're gonna get some call screener.  When you call us when we work on an FM radio station, we're all in the room. We can all hear the call. Even if it's not one of us answering. It's Bunda see, you know, and we can hear you we can hear so in here, there's no like, oh tell the person on the radio. He's an asshole. It's like what you've just told me. I'm the person on the radio. It's funny how much softens when they're like, oh you can hear me. Oh, you're the person on the radio. I mean, all I need to say is that you know, you really should do your homework. Yeah. Well, I told you that time when I am accidentally  He did a sports trivia question and I was like, where's Wayne Gretzky from and instead of saying Branford. I said Brampton and it was just it kind of came out wrong. Oh my God. Same thing as Classic Rock Fans Sports Nuts. Oh, yeah. Well just need to drive it home. Same thing probably had a hundred calls after that you dummy well because I was doing a contest with someone and I told him they got it wrong. Yeah. Yeah. Well, no, I think I don't think they sell.  Said Branford, they said something else and I said no Brampton. Idiot. Yeah, I get Brampton and Brantford and no brand fraud from Bradford Bradford. See forget it. I get those two mixed up all the time. It's confusing traffic and I got like a collision and Bradford. I'm screwed. It shouldn't be allowed to have two cities that are towns named so closely, you know Afters we using the similar letters or how about this.  A speaking of the worst. Uh-huh. You know what you see here are show on Wednesday. Sometimes we do the worst Wednesdays. The worst is Whitby and Pickering both have a brock is Brock Road and Brock Street one of them now it's changed since they've reconfigured like added the new highway to the 407 but it used to be you'd have to be on Brock and I was getting mixed up road to get up to the 407 the one that's in Pickering. Yes anyway.  I got off the one that was in Whitby or whatever before and was a whole nightmare. I just remember swag. Why would you have two of the same name? So close to each other? They're literally what 10 minutes down from each other on the fall one crazy. It is crazy. You know, it's like it off at Dundas F versus Dundas Street, like why you never do that? No, we're have Whitby next to wit blue or you know, like when Yahweh we play or Whitby stupid.  Welcome to another podcast we do to usually to we can we always have the take two podcast which is where we just have like a compilation of all the stuff we did from the week on the radio that we put out there and then we do we try and do like just a new content version. Yeah, which is what we're doing right now and we try and get one out every week. But sometimes we miss one for whatever reason there's things that come up. Mmm. I'm not sure what exactly you want to do. This one. I could play you an audio clip here from  Kelly Clarkson she's got a new talk show. What do you think the chances of this lasting are you know, I've interviewed Kelly and she is lovely and just lots to say always right. Yeah. She's never a boring interview. So I think she's going to be good at this job. You think yeah. I wonder if people thought the same thing about Ellen because I'm a little more skeptical of Kelly Clarkson's ability to like Captivate an audience for an hour every day. She's funny. Did she start off with a few big like  Yes on her show though, too. Well, she was supposed to have Chris Chris Hart no heart Kevin Hart. Sorry and then he got in that car accident. So the rock ended up stepping in for her him. I just be nice. I just noticed that a lot of the audio that's being sent to our away and some of our prep Services. It's just her singing on the show really like their yeah, it's as though it's like well, I don't know maybe you can sing because that's her real skill set. So, this is Kelly Clarkson covering Miley Cyrus is  Is Wrecking Ball on her show?  Wow, I mean she can really sing but I find that weird. Like if singing came up in a natural way in a conversation and she just started belting out that would be cool. But the fact that she has a band and she's doing like a mini concert. What?  It's nice. Okay, we're and she's doing it a lot. Here's Kelly Clarkson covering the weekend. I can't feel my face. It's almost like she's doing a variety show, but she's the only guest I feel like I'm at a wedding and it's like a wedding band up on stage and you'd rather hear the CD version of the song, you know, yeah.  I mean, she's so talented. I just find it a little bit annoying when you have people that are really good at one thing and they just assume they'll be really good at another thing and I guess with daytime talk shows. They do that a lot with celebrities. I know Harry Connick jr. Had one for a bit. I can't imagine that show still on I never hear about it. Alan was definitely a rising star in that format. Who would have seen that coming maybe you know, although so good. Yeah, she  She's the new Oprah, you know, everyone was wondering who is going to be the new queen of daytime talk or King for that matter and she's definitely rise and risen up to that level. You know, who I the jury is out on Lilly Singh. Oh, yeah. It's seen her show. She can do some funny bits on her show because that's sort of what she did on YouTube She's a Canadian YouTube star from you know, the greater Toronto area and she got this job. She comes on. I think it's called a little late.  Her with Lily saying so there's The Tonight Show, then you got Seth Meyers and then it's her show and what I find a little bit annoying as it's just I'm getting tired of seeing people hired for jobs that they have no skills to do and it's all based on something else. They've done in their life. So you're saying based on her YouTube content. This is totally a stretch for her. Well look for the bits, and I haven't watched a lot.  Her show but maybe there's tons of bits. She's really good at the bit part. But then the whole talking with people and having to do the other 85% of the show. I don't feel like it's really her wheelhouse per se because I watched parts of it a few times trying to see if you know if it's any good and it reminds me of an infomercial where you have somebody playing the role of a talk show host and you know, it just is that it's got that stick sticky insincerity or you know, they're working too hard to do it.  Well, you give her a chance man. I will you know, how people are Rusty when they first get going took me many many many years before I felt like I figured out yeah morning radio, but you know, you had worked in radio a long time before you had a chance to do morning radio. And before you got a regular shift on the radio, you were doing overnights. You're working your way up. And so here's somebody who's a YouTube Star. Let's give her her own show on a major Network in the u.s. Right away.  It's a Blog. It's a lot to take in and I'm starting to see that in radio a lot where people are hired for all the things that they're good at off the air. Yes. Yes, it's hot Trend. Yeah, you know, you see people it's like oh, well, they look like the demo, uh, you know, this is a radio station that's trying to cater to 30 year olds while they're just under 30 and they have great Instagram videos and they have a large Instagram audience. I'll block they must be good on the radio. Let's put them on and then it's a disaster. It's  funny how important Instagram followers are these days even my acting agent said like you now when they have casting notifications that go out to agencies across the GTA. They will literally sometimes say we only want people who have over 10,000 followers to come out for this one. Yeah, because they want influencers who are promoting whatever the show is on social media as well. Okay, I get what you're saying, but if the product ends up being  Bad then it's a lose lose lose lose. The person gets on camera and they suck well because like with Lilly Singh for example, right for some reason the Rotten Tomato score by the critics it giving it a hundred percent the show, but wow audience scores at 49 and on IMDb the scores at three point three out of ten. So there's a massive disconnect from from what obviously suits or critics or whatever looking for versus what the audience is actually looking for and don't get me wrong. I mean it television hosting is a hard thing to get good at until you're doing it.  It right sure so radio might be a little different. I'm just I guess I get a little bitter because I had to work my way up and then I see other people just slide into these jobs because they you know shot a quirky Instagram video and I'm like what the hell is going on? And you know, what I loved is when is when they hired to replace David Letterman because they went with experience over like the somebody's image. Okay, and it  This is all part of the evolution of reality TV. And you know, you don't need to be a skilled broadcaster in order to be a great broadcaster and that may be true some of the time but they hired Steven Colbert to replace Letterman a guy who's like already 50 ish, right 50-something. Yeah, they didn't you know, you would think looking at the trends in television and radio and stuff. They would hire somebody who's young they have a great Instagram following and they'll figure out the job after he was a guy who was on The Daily Show. He had his own talk.  You know like character-driven TV show with The Colbert Report and he's Super Hyper intelligent and funny and smart and he went in that job and now he's number one. Right? And I love that because he's definitely not the person you know, when I was working at the other radio station, we were at yeah our boss when we first got there just after I was hired they hired our new boss. Yeah, she would have never hired me for that job. You told her that to her face, but because you know, I didn't fit check all those boxes.  Is everything else outside of being on the air right? Look the hair box the hair box. I'm not single. I'm not on Tinder. I'm not doing all these things at a relatable to our audience, but it's like it doesn't mean I can't talk about them. This seems to be a trend in the entertainment business that it's not about how good you are at the job you're going to be doing it's everything else and I find that annoying. So I feel like that's a little bit the case with Kelly Clarkson. She's this great performer on stage, but now she's doing a talk show and it's feels a little weak does it?  Feel like she's doing a talk show. It feels like she's doing a concert Terror feels a little bit like Canadian Idol or I American Idol I should say with her playing these cover songs. Yeah, and then she has to do all the interviewing and stuff. But you know, maybe she'll learn enough and Conan O'Brien was not amazing when he first started hosting late night television because he was a writer before he was ever a performer, right and he got good at it. So man, it's a tough gig I've done live TV before it is terrifying.  Bye Mmm Yeah, but I count you down 3 2 1 then they throw it to you and you're like, you know, there's a certain adrenaline behind it and you get kind of addicted to that high. But if you screw up, it's gone like you can't get it back. You can't redo it. Yeah. Well, I want to see Lilly Singh do really well because she's Canadian and you know like you do so female hosts are yes, but then I you know, I also think of like, there's a lot other stronger females that I think could have got that job, you know.  Sarah Silverman or like Whitney Cummings or a Tina Fey, but you know, they may not have even wanted the job. So he knows your true. It's like the late late late later show that comes on at I she must come on at 1:30 in the morning or something live. No, no, no. Okay. Yeah, it's all recorded. And to be honest all late-night television these days nobody is even watching it live you ask, you know, Fallon or Kim or any of those guys and they say it's all about the bits that end up on YouTube and getting the views there. Well, there you go. That's why they hired  Leasing I guess it's alright the bits that end up on YouTube. Why do you think they hired her? Yeah, but yeah, that's a really good point. But then you actually go to watch the show and inside when you're not doing the bit. It's a struggle, but I guess if they don't care about that, maybe it doesn't matter. Maybe it buys her a bit of time to get stronger at that interviewing part. If it's really about the YouTube. It's right. Yeah, they must know what they're doing those suits. Yeah kiss. I'm starting to sound like a grumpy old guy you had to be good at  At the job to get it you have to move to Regina. I had to live in hell Saskatchewan was a hell. Yeah, you wouldn't go back a nice people. Oh my God. It's the last place. I would go really in Canada that are met Manitoba would suck. But I think I'd rather be a Manitoba because they have close to Lake of the Woods and canora and Lake Winnipeg and I like to sail and stuff but Saskatchewan there is water there, but  In a whole lot else that is a boring Province an amazing oldies station. Apparently not anymore turned into a news talk when I was there. I was the last morning guy on that oldies station. Oh really? They had to change the whole format after you left. Well, no, they fired the guy and then they like hey, why don't you sit there do it for two weeks before we flip to a new stock? Okay, so I did do it. You know who did it was the morning guy? There is the guy who does the weather for CTV News Tom Brown? Oh cool downtown Tom Brown. Wow, he's always out of breath.  He is a breath I think about when I'm watching is whether I'm like it's okay. We got a little extra time. He's on he's under the gun again to squeeze it all in my TV. Yeah 45 seconds to get it all in I think he's great at it. I think it's good. Yeah, what did you want to talk about in this podcast Laura blew me away. I've been reading all morning about this huge sex trafficking ring. That was just  taken down in Ontario and I know it's bit dark but like these are things I only hear about in the movies and to think that it's actually happening it like the Kingpin of the sex trafficking ring was in Toronto when they arrested him this happens all the time in in our country and you know, so in my experience in you know, reading about these stories like you're talking about is that people's perception of what sex  kicking is versus what it actually is are two different things. Everyone just assumes that these are people who wanted to come to Canada. Maybe they came across in a container hidden or something right there rushing or Eastern European they end up here and then there you know used as you know prostitutes and stuff in order to pay their fair, right because all of a sudden the price went up when they got here and there and don't get me wrong that happens, but it also happens to people who  Are from Canada who live here? It could be someone who runs away from home and all of a sudden they meet up with a guy who's like really helping her out and then all of a sudden they start doing drugs together and it's all like they basically luer you in and then before, you know, what you owe the guy a bit of money and now in order to pay him back, he's going to start bringing you to the strip joint to start working for your money that way on. Oh, by the way, also you're going to have to prostitute yourself.  Self because now you owe us two thousand dollars for the drugs that you've been taking with me and then you're stuck in this world of like doing drugs and owing people money and they hold you hostage essentially because of that and debt to pay off and you have no one in your you've left home. You're not you know, you've left home for a reason because maybe you're being abused there or whatever and you're stuck in this world and no one's there to rescue you and it's scary to think that someone who's born in Hamilton or Toronto could end up in the wrapped up in  I don't know what the circumstance was. But the victims were from Quebec. They were all women from Quebec about 33 of them and they had moved them to Ontario and west across Canada. So they would slowly move you to places across the country and you'd be stuck in this, you know, either apartment or terrible hotel room with like other women who are in the same boat. Yeah, they Shuffle you around because there  are so many people who are part of the the Trafficking Organization that had little stations all across the country. But these were Canadian people Canadian, you know, kingpins and Canadian women police see that there were two extremely terrified women who called police they had tried to escape before and failed and were like violently beaten and assaulted they told police these guys were holding roughly 30 women hostage they were using  To keep them there and based on that phone call. They were able to start this investigation a year ago and caught basically the Kingpin organizer of this sex trafficking ring. But the thing that freaks me out is like I saw a photo of him getting in the back of a cruiser. Yeah, and he did not look like a pimp wasn't wearing a fur coat like the pimp costume you get yeah Halloween that  Rises you I mean not looking like a pimp at all when I went to University. I lived in a building that was owned by the Hells Angels and the these two have a went to a place called Bishops University and in Lenox Hill Quebec. They had a clubhouse there. Yeah, I think it's now gone or shut down or something, but it was a legit Hells Angels compounded had bulletproof glass in the building. It had electrified fences out front. Anyway, our landlord would tell us stories about the guys who you know, he would have to interact with because he was  Working for them. They have a lot of legitimate businesses because they have to be able to launder their money that they get through drug sales and stuff and he would say, you know, a lot of these guys don't look anything like what you would imagine, you know, they're not always riding around on their motorcycles wearing their cots with their patch on the back. Sometimes they're wearing suits, you know, they have to play the role of business people and they are business people. They're just in a business that has a lot of corruption and crime. Yeah.  So yeah, they never quite look it's never like you'd imagine. It is in the movies right very rarely. Anyway, I know so it's amazing that they they they got this drug ring. I'll tell you, you know, when I hear these stories it makes me think that we really should legalize prostitution because there are women and men who are totally okay with making money in that industry. Yep, you know if they get treated fairly and if it's safe and the fact that  Tushin isn't legal is what allows all this other criminal activity to exist. And I don't know if he would ever eliminate it completely because he would be you know, we're seeing it now with legalized weed. You think one of the reasons why they did it was to put the drug dealers out of commission while they've done such a bad job with it. The drug dealers are still operating. I'm sure there's fewer of them, but it's still happening. Maybe they'll get better, right, you know because I'll get better and they not you know, like don't you think if you wanted to sell your body to make money you were comfortable with it.  Didn't bother you. Yeah, don't you think you should have a right to do that? Sure. If you wanted to it's your body you can make that decision. The problem is is that in a lot of cases with the sex industry is there's a lot of people who are being forced into it and it's not their decision and they're not comfortable doing it and they end up it's essentially it's a form of rape. So are they afraid to come forward because what they're doing is illegal, is that it like well, what do you mean that people that are being sex trafficked? Yeah. No, I think they're just being held hostage and they really don't see a way out.  The duty as you said that you know people were getting beaten if they try and Escape. Yes, and they're not given access to necessarily phones or whatever. You know, we say by the way, if you're ever in a situation where you're around somebody like this and they're not act they're acting like it's okay and that you know, they're happy to be there that it usually isn't the case and they're told to put a front up like that sure and you know, they have the fear of of the retribution. Yes, but also some of these  People and it's not just women. It's sometimes man, but they, you know, they're addicted to drugs now because they're trying to cope with all the terrible things that are going on in their life. So it ends up being this like terrible hole there in that. They just can't imagine climbing out of yes, because you know, they get the drugs through the people that are holding them hostage. And and now you owe the money so Gary. Yeah, it's terrible. What a great topic for our podcast. Yes. You're welcome. I saw an article about a serial killer.  I did see a segment on 60 Minutes about this serial killer that they've who's in jail in the United States and they figure he is the worst one in the history of the country. I read an article about this one it figure he's killed possibly run 90 people and he got away with it forever like a 70s or something. There's an old man and now he's starting to talk. There was this one guy this one police officer. I think like a Texas Ranger and he ended up having a conversation with a guy and found.  A way to get him to talk and now he's been super Cooperative to the point where and this guy's memory of the crimes is insane. Really? Yeah. So these serial killers are killing people and they're taking you know snapshots with their mind because that's how they you know, they live off that it's almost and they have their trophies and stuff like that and some cases it's mental trophies. This guy was giving details about crimes that happened decades ago that were spot on which is how they were able to figure out that he was telling the truth about the people he had  Old he was providing information on all these cold cases that were never solved and so in that they've linked him positively to so many more murders than he was in initially charged with when he was caught the first time. So what kind of mental trophies does this guy have? Well, he just he has a photographic memory of the crime scenes and the things that he did to these people and stuff that only the killer would know, you know what I mean? And so there he's providing this information to this.  Texas Ranger who ended up having multiple interviews with him because he was just like this Floodgate of information it got to the point where this guy the serial killer was painting pictures of the victims and they were able to identify the victims from the paintings. He was doing and in some cases they're just be someone he followed from a bar and murdered. You know what I mean, like think about interactions you had a month ago with somebody that didn't lead to murder buddy on the street, but, you know trying to draw a picture of them and this guy had the image just crystal clear in his  Ray so after watching that episode is do you think that there is a way that you could have deterred this guy from choosing you as a victim or if he was killing you. Is there a way that you could have like did he get pleasure in you being in pain? So all that all the terrible things you have nightmares about you is like you're not in pain. Is that going to make him stop? They didn't really get into that. I have no idea. There's some sort of fight back. Don't fight back, you know, try and make them feel. Well. There was a story we covered the other day.  Where somebody was able to convince the killer that you know to feel bad for them and they were able to get away even in Silence of the Lambs like once the woman who was in the well started telling him about herself. Yeah. He's getting angry about it angle it. Yeah. I just wish there was a tactic you could use I don't think there's a tactic to deal with, you know one that works for sure right? Sometimes it probably works to fight back other times, maybe not I mean  The one thing they always seem to do in these movies is when you see someone kidnapped or abducted is that they try and get the parents or the family members on television hoping that the kidnapper or abductor will see it and then feel like summer more some remorse and you see the humanity and the person they're not an object. They're not like a yes a tool for sexual gratification. It's a daughter. It's a brother, you know what I mean, right we talk about something else.  This is so dark speaking of 60 Minutes. I can't believe you don't watch that show. You send an email to me last night about how much you love the show. Yeah, and I was like, okay, I'm going to watch it. You are a but I can't find it Sunday night 7 p.m. Okay, so I'll be ch-ch-ch RCBS having the Canadian. I tried to like find it on demand not available like really on Netflix movie know. Okay. I'll try to file. I'll set the DVR. It's such.  Great show if you want to try and figure or learn a little bit about something sounds a bit like an old man show, but I'll get it totally comes across as an old man show, but you start watching an episode of 60 minutes and chant it. I very rarely would I ever want to fast forward? They're so good at what they do really? Well even understanding like what's going on in the US with the impeachment and what the different sides are saying, you know get caught up on that. Yeah. We're like there's all kinds of protesting going on in Hong Kong. Do you have any idea why like you see  The clips on the news and so, you know trying to get a better understanding of that. They give you like a full idea of what's going on why they're acting out. I need to understand that because I hear the Raptors at the first like home opening game. Everyone's getting a t-shirt that says, you know, the Toronto Raptors stand with Hong Kong. Well, there was an NBA official somebody in the NBA who tweeted something that was pro-china. Okay. The Hong Kong is sort of its in  The control of China but it's always had a level of Independence. Okay were able to act and they and so the people that live there wanted to be a full democracy. Okay, and China wants to be able to pull back on the freedoms that they've had for so long and so now the people are protesting and then it's getting one of those things where the cops are beating up the protesters. So the protesters are now using violence against the police and the armies and that's very interesting. I shot a couple of episodes of an HG TV show  Years ago in Beijing and I remember being there and my boyfriend at the time came with me and the production staff was like, you know, you guys should wear wedding bands because you need to be married to be sharing a hotel room. Oh, really? Yeah in Beijing although but that seemed to care that's China right? They were like you really should wear wedding bands guys, so that that was interesting. Yeah. That's a learned about great white sharks. Okay. What about great whites  There's a lot more of them on the east coast of the US and Canada. Oh, yeah, like around Halifax Nova Scotia. Is that why there's more shark attacks? So we're hearing there is a well there certainly was like the first death since the 30s in Cape Cod as a result of the great white sharks and you want to know why there's more of them pollution. No because there's more seals in the area because they are a protected animal on because seal populations have been increasing around Cape Cod in that part of Eastern United States.  The the fish are coming in to eat, right? Well that's quite Couric's or sharks were like borderline is extinct for a while. Great whites who great whites were seen there were fewer and far between and that area now, they're repopulating. But what I also learned from that episode of the students here is that nobody's ever seen a great white shark mate, isn't that crazy? They have no no one's ever witnessed them mating or giving birth. I don't think what would be crazy is witnessing a great white shark.  Having sex with another I'd be like, oh my God. Yeah. Are you seeing this that shirts penis is huge even know how they mate. I'm just I was just about to Google. Yeah. Well mate. I don't think it's like thrusting. I'm sure it's more of an injection some are. Yeah, but there must be some Rod that goes in to do the injection is there's so many animals. I have no idea how they made. Is it a laying of a  An egg situation and then another shark comes along and fertilizes the Egg sharks. No because they give birth they have it in the belly. They got it inside so they got to get see millions in their belief based on observations of other shark species researchers believe male white sharks must first bite their mates near their heads and a little affection Larry the very end there. They don't hang around in pods. They're very autonomous. They sort of move around on their own. Okay.  Then they insert their claspers claspers American class. / yeah. Sounds like you get a little jolt a it. Sounds like you get a little jolt. Let me look at a class. / yeah, here it is. Is it similar to the male penis it actually when it's totally up underneath the underside it almost looks like a vagina.  Because it's got it this sort of two of them and there's they're held up underneath so they look it looks like the opening of a vagina, but I guess they kind of are able to extend them. So is a shark mating with another shark belly-to-belly or is it back to more of like a through the shark's mouth female shark has a marine biologist join us on our next podcast. Now, I would imagine that the the private parts go into the private parts.  No, but I mean do you go belly to belly or just one have to go on the other back? Hmm. I'm looking at pictures. I can't say that I'm thinking about it. I do remember being at the Toronto aquarium and seeing shark eggs. Oh, yeah, so do after their inseminated do they release the eggs? And then they hatch or do they hatch inside the like uterus? So whatever it is would be in the shark and then swim out. It's crazy, man.  Oh my God, there's so much. They didn't cover that in a 60-minute episode. You clearly learned nothing. Yeah, but all I'm telling you now. I mean, I feel like I learned a lot from 16 minutes of a piece. Uh-huh. I love watching it. Well enough that's kind of sounded like I knew what I was talking about for a while there and now it all just fell to Pieces about the pimp costume. No for cocaine. Yeah. Did you know that term?  No was hit by a hurricane. My kids tried to tell me this story. I guess they were learning about it in school or something. I'm like, there's never been a hurricane in Toronto. Like maybe the after effects of a hurricane. Yeah, you got to be kind of near a coast. Yank. But it was 65 years ago. I think even this week it's the 65th anniversary of a hurricane that hit Toronto where a bunch of people died. In fact, it was originally a  Corey for storm that affected South Carolina, but it was still registering as a category 1 hurricane when it slammed into Toronto back 65 years ago. It was called Hurricane Hazel and 80 people were killed really they thought they didn't really have the kind of forecast that we have today and they were expecting some rain, but what they ended up getting was 200 millimeters of rain really quickly and it flooded the Humber River.  River as well as the dawn River and people used to live down by the Humber River really in a van down by the river know and you know, they had homes and stuff and so people and homes and vehicles were washed away and people drowned there was thousands of families 4,000 families were displaced as a result of this man, and it's so they eventually changed the whole rules about where you could live around.  These rivers and because of this hurricane, so I guess they've learned a lot from it. I find like when I'm driving on Bayview and the Bayview extension by the DVP when you're down in the valley when you're near Evergreen brickworks, I'm like, why don't more people live down here. It's beautiful. Yeah, why because it's a protected area that you're not allowed to live in they you know, people whose homes were fine. They ended up like knocking them down and write displacing them as a result of that. I just hate when I'm  When my kids are like there was a hurricane in Toronto like this never been in a hurricane. He talking about there's no way we're in land right like bitter was and then I looked it up and I was like, oh my God, you're right. I can't wait for your kids to prove you wrong over and over again, you know, well they will they will for sure. I'll tell you something when you were 13 year old that they are right about everything no matter what the truth is really that. Oh, yeah. So annoying. Yeah, why just even remember?  Something as stupid as my daughter was trying to tell me that we'd became legal on October 21st. I'm like no it was October 17th. We covered it a lot at work. No, it was a 21st. We had to do the whole well, look it up. You know, she sounds exactly like you a little carbon copy of you Tucker's wow. Wait till your daughter's older. I can't wait. I love that. I know that direction you're headed in because I have two daughters. I love like seeing you go.  The different steps that I've already been through reminiscent like do you have fond memories when I tell you about like yesterday we were in The Distillery District. I was picking her up from daycare and she pretty much jumped in every single muddy puddle that existed on my way home from the daycare was soaked from the waist down. Yeah. My difference is I wouldn't be as fun as you in that scenario here. I stopped her and less we were you're right next door. So I guess it's not a big deal. Yeah. I was just like do it and all the tips.  They're having fun. Yeah, that wouldn't really bother me I guess but if we had to get in my car and go somewhere I would have never allowed that to happen because then there'd be you know mud everywhere. Yeah, my guess that's gonna do it for us Maura. Yeah fundus fun times as always if you're listening to the end of this. Thank you. I don't know. I don't know if it was a really good one today if you like.  It was sort of dark and all over the place happens sometimes when there's dark stuff in the news, right? And I was also like feeling as though I was talking about stuff. I didn't really know about it's not really an expert on shark mating about a lot of stuff and that's all thanks to 60 minutes.  Anyway, thank you and we'll see you again.  You know me.	We share fun stories of screwing up at work and then getting put on blast for it!  Tucker rants about about people getting jobs they aren't qualified for or don't deserve and then somehow we end up discussing sharks mating...  Just 3 friends hanging out and talking -- never know where the convo might go!

Welcome back to Fair. It's gone episode 5 here with Ryan and Gabe Simmons is actually back from his long long time away due to homework. I've been doing for the last two bars. Love Justin it. Was it just this last one. Now the last two well, that's two. I know you gave up. Oh, yeah. All right. I'll go homework. No. Thank you. All right.  Pat I want Chief today on the lineup, of course, we got postseason talk. We have an interview with Jordan break. We have our top 10 first baseman's list and of course r 1 star R from the postseason for the first week of the postseason. So let's kick it off by talking about the NL Wild Card Game Brewers Nats. What a game? Oh my goodness. So I was just that was Tuesday night. I just phone into Chicago for the conference sitting in the hotel room, right?  Going on two hours of sleep. So I was wiped out and had the game won bottom of the eighth the Nats come up hater through two pitches and I literally turned the TV off because I was like, okay, this is over. I'll go to bed and get some sleep and I woke up and one of my good friends at Tech is in that span and I almost texted him the next morning and told him how sorry I was before. I checked the box score and lo and behold the Nationals won. So  Yeah, I don't think anybody expected that and as much as we want to pin it on hater boy Trent Grisham and right field on that play. I was pretty so that's something you'd see in 10 year old. Totally. I can only imagine if Yelich was in right how different that game would have been  yeah, it's actually funny because before the playoff start I threw my predictions up to again to Justin. I guess the didn't make the last pod but I said for the NL I picked Milwaukee to beat the Nationals for three and I said the Brewers come back from the two run lead in the ninth inning. So when the game and I was almost right I had to score right? I had the cam back right? I just had the wrong team. They're all getting and for of all people for to meet Josh Hayter was pretty astounding he's been one of the most reliable both in arms and all baseball last year's and  Last year 10 shutout Innings the playoffs for him to be the one to blow that game was shocked me. I was pretty astounded. Yeah. I mean, I wouldn't put it all on him because awfully nothing routine play in right field base is cleared. He should have had a shot to throw out the second guy at home instead, but I mean, yeah can't you can't get the bases loaded either as a picture. I mean, I'm sitting there in my apartment watching this game. Yasmani goes deep offshore's overstating. I'm high by one.  Nashville has to lose next thing. You know, she's next thing. You know who went deep in second. Thanks. Things went deep big muscle boy went Deep - 81 my power curve ball out of the Zone risk Flex at 400. I'm feeling good. What just pumping 100 Bullpen comes in souter gets the job done pomeranz gets the job done like okay Josh hater one of the most reliable closes and all of baseball. It's coming in to shut the door and oh my gosh ball.  Ball ball ball ball. I'm like, come on man. He's little he's literally couldn't make an adjustment. He was 98 99 at eye level every single pitch and he didn't have a slider and then obviously Trent just messed it all up it look it almost looked like he was trying to get around the ball to throw somebody out. I think he was succeeding that run or succeeding succeeding. Yes at home plate, and he was trying to throw whoever was going out to Third and try to wrap around the ball and was too late on it and  It took some kind of it had some weird spin on it like you took a weird hop. Yep. Yeah, I think you should just safety stopped it and let your closer try to get one more out. But there was two outs right? Yep. Yeah, that's right can't have that. Yeah, so Nationals 143 they advance to have to go play La Al wild card game raise Athletics, but Nia Morden.  Jonnie Dee has started off with a ding dong first at-bat back from the il-2 on top of that was his first hit since like July. Yeah. Yeah, he's been on the house of July they end up when it five to one and he big thoughts about this game. Um, I can't remember but I think I had Oakland winning so a little bit surprised but I mean Rays have the rotation and I didn't think they quite had the  Up to match days, but when you're pitching is on your pitching Zone.  If it was a five-game series, I'll take that Flex every time because I think they have a better offense, but you have a one-game series where the pitching is huge. Yeah, a tray is definitely better rotation. And it showed I thought like it was a minaya. Yeah. He was obviously not very sharp, but the bullpen for the A's game of chance to come back. They seven Innings of one-run ball pretty darn good but they should never got their offense rolling and that was the difference and I was pretty disappointed because I picked the Athletics to not only win the wild card game just  You always have to get upset right? I just picked them as pick beat the Astros and seven for around five rather's. All right, although we all know that's probably not gonna happen. And yeah that half Astros are disgusting. But yeah not when Verlander's out here Berlin during teams true. Yeah. Well, I didn't think Warren pitch that well, I mean he gave up eight Bay shores of five innings. Just FYI. She couldn't get anyone across all that matters. Is he gave up one run? And I'd say that's a pretty darn good ball game.  Yeah, I mean watching the game. I really thought the Athletics lineup at some point was gonna get going. Even when Borden came out of the Zone. It came out of the game. I mean, they have a pretty stacked lineup one through one through nine and surprisingly they got shut down. All again raised have an underrated pain though. Oh, yeah, that's some good guys. That just aren't household names Castillo Anderson. Yeah, Alvarado's heard obviously, but Anderson has been ridiculous, since they got him. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Hey remember when  Protected him from the AL Wild Card down the first podcast and y'all boasted Indians. Yeah. Yeah, it's not just that they're you can throw out whenever you get right which I'm sure happens more than I'll be right. But yeah, you also pick the A's to beat the Astros in the distance there. Yeah, that's fair. Hi moved all over to the nlds Cardinals Brave series tied at 1-1 Cardinals win 7 to 6 in the first game. It was it wasn't nearly as close as the score.  Or says Braves take again 3D 0 in the second game. I'm just going to scam a come out game one Hakuna is I don't care that you go 3 for 4. Look. I'm I will be the biggest proponent of backflips, you know pictures running off the mound - your own team up, but you cannot bat flip a ball that hits the wall my yeah my quick five-second or ten second rate with that.  You can if you hit it for 50 and clobber, you can pimp it all you want. I think the exit view all and that was 93 if you're hitting the ball 93 Oppo down the right field line. You better split the first base and if it gets out, you can jog the rest of the way, but  I mean that was not one. He really got into it. Yeah, that's just inexcusable. But again, you can't what are you gonna do bench him? Yeah, exactly cannot yeah, but I mean those are separate issues. Like I've never really really thought if he has been like a super arrogant type or anything like that. I like him as a player. But yeah, that's the second time this year. He's made a mistake like that and at certain happen happened Leo.  Oh, yeah, it's not going to yeah, he's out there benched. I'm not saying that but yeah, that's exactly why you have to hustle things out and it actually I want to bring this up. So hustle is just one of those things that can make such a huge difference that no one ever talks about Ryan. You know remember this play Virginia Tech UVA last year in football. Remember the plant before half-time Ryan Willis chased him Brian Willis chase down eating a guy who had a wide open TouchDown if you through pick if he puts his head down doesn't hustle UVA ones that  Football game and we're not talking about streak anymore all that stuff. It's critical. It's just one of those things you can't make mental mistakes. That's what it is. It's a mental mistake. So yeah a community fine. Yeah, I guess it's a mental mistake, but that's the one thing. I mean him not being able to call with whatever.  Anybody can host there's zero excuse for not hustling and that's something I guess. He didn't learn from it the first time but yeah, that's something again if you pimp one 450 go ahead that flip all you want but if it's questionable run and if it gets out, you can jog the rest of the way. If not now you got to hustle double. Well that that it's a crazy thing is it comes up in the night thing it takes Carlos Martinez 450 and then sit like, okay. There you go. I mean pimp that one, but I mean, I don't  A short of a portion is out of SunTrust of the right-field. I mean that ball is off the fence. You have to at least maybe it's I'm not even telling you to bust it 100% out the box, but he literally hit it, you know the back in walked his first 10 12 steps. Exactly. Even the even if you just like half run it just seven days and turn it on in the second 90 you're there but whatever. Yeah, he's not the reason the Braves lost the game don't panic. I think he would have gotten stranded at third that in any way even if he  Had gotten a double. But again, it's the principle because he could very well have done that in a situation where he could have been the tying run and that made a huge difference. Yeah, that's game five. And that's has his Brave season ended. Yeah, but again further along in the game. He's not the reason the Braves lost Mark Martin comes out Braves, you know trade deadline acquisition comes out has an oblique hip something went wrong with them had to come.  Outlook Jackson comes in cold goes from it takes him 700 feet. He gets tagged for another run. We have to bring Melanson in a long learner. He gets tagged for a few doubles down the lines Braves Bullpen per usual implodes.  Rolling in the game to go ahead get what he got. How about how about phone see? Ya good stack the game.  Yeah, it's awesome. Hold faulty. What a what a performance seven Innings three hits seven Kaze. No walks.  Yeah, he out pitching Flaherty who's a Scion candidate this year?  A faulty over the last month or so has really turned it on.  I mean for like yeah after being AAA all year. I saw the Tweet. Someone said imagine if you are Braves fan and June and you woke up in a coma today and you saw that Adam Duvall who was in AAA and Mike foltynewicz choose and AAA LED you to a postseason Victory. We all know he could do it. He had that outstanding season last year. Just whatever happened first half the season. Yeah, he was great. That sounds exactly like Colorado's entire pitching staff this year. Yeah.  Outstanding season last year and then what the hell happened here? Yeah, but for like some reference the last seven games of the regular season foltynewicz for and 11.7 three era in 41 and two thirds Innings .84 whip he's been bet it's good as anybody except player to come down the back into the regular season. He's continued on into the postseason Duval hit a two-run shot.  Max freed comes in Melanson gets to save pretty cut and dry so I can game.  I'm like these Brands given the name of the series that that game the game to just folds out pitching their race that's got to be pretty dumb or less for the Cardinals even though they are at home. So game 3 is huge but the Braves game of game three, I don't see the Cardinals win it who's going for the Braves tomorrow stroke Soroka with a 1 5 5 regular season CRA at a way fields and the Cardinals are throwing way. No, I believe so because Hudson is safe for game four.   Uncle Wainwright  tomorrow for 10  I think the biggest thing that I have the last take I have on this series is how good Max freed has been I think he could step into a big role even if the Braves don't use them as a starter. Now that Taran has been called up in the postseason roster. I mean, I'm not set on tearing as you know, one game he could give up seven bombs and seven batters, but freed his looked really good out of the pin. I hope that they stretch him into almost Andrew Miller type role to where he's going two innings 2 and 1/3  Because in both outings, he's had he's absolutely just shoved game 1-1 inning two k's game to another inning two cases one hit that's that's my last take on that. He's whacked. It's between him or Kershaw. He's got a beautiful purple. He's got one of the best best two curveballs in the game. Laughs are all about riding who's hot and if he's hot if you fry them thrown, two three things if you're in a close game, that's all that's what it's all about. You don't want to get guys  There's had an IRA last three outings. Yeah stretch them. Absolutely great moving on to the other side of in ideas Nats Dodgers Dodgers. Take game 1 6 0 Nats come back take it forward to thoughts. Um, did anyone think Shares are was gonna come out of the pen yesterday until he started warming up. I mean, I guess I saw he was going to throw a side session anyway, so that kind of covered is side session. I think he's still on track to start Sunday, but  Yeah, I was not expecting that but honestly good move by David Martinez singing outside the box that was a must-win game for the nads. If you're going down. Oh to in that series to the Dodgers, you're not climbing out of that hole, especially with the Nats playoff history. Yep, absolutely agree and I was registered by Tino Martinez. Yeah. He managed that game like a game seven and he needed to 100 percent agree.  Yeah, I mean Corbin look terrible what he walked four in the first inning settle down ended up not having a bad game, but walk forward in that first inning of game one ended up walking five that game.  Nats Bullpen per usual gave up four runs late jackpot in a matter not the Americas Walker Buehler was freaking amazing. Yeah, goodness. Six Innings one hit one hit in a case. And he's my whole year to by the end of next season. I think Walker Buehler will be a top-five pitcher in baseball and I don't even know if that's a hot take that's not otic I could say. Yes. Yeah he is.  He looks good. You did walk three but I mean that's a good Nationals offense. You shut down one in six Innings. That's pretty darn good.  Well, though yeah, good now you got it. You got it.  Are you still talk about game one that was good with it on. Yeah, that's that's yeah. Okay, Kershaw takes a loss game to the Kirsch all postseason curse continues. I guess he didn't he didn't have a bad game. But again, he takes a loss the bullpen does. All right. They only give up one run.  Obviously Scherzer came in and shut the door with three cases in one inning Stroudsburg pitched one heck of a game six Innings, 10 cases one earned run only allowed three hits top of the lineup did work for the Nationals Turner to four five Eden to four five randone two for four.  But yeah, the Nationals took this in my opinion pretty handily.  Yeah, and I don't know I could be wrong but off the top of my head. I don't think Kershaw is really been helped out by his as much as we talk about his postseason struggles. I don't know that he's really been helped out by his offense and toning those playoff games either. I can't really remember a game where his offense jumped out to a decent lead. He was kind of always I mean you make one mistake and you're down to oh and you're still sitting down 200 in the fifth inning. It's a little harder to pitch when you're not getting support from your offense.  There's not one game. He had a few years ago where he had like seven runs terrorists are of yeah. I think that it's more like six runs that game but like every other game, he's pitched fine not like saw a young one point five year a good but fine have a quality story last night throat. Did he throw? Six Innings? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, six Innings three earned runs. Yeah always start that exactly that's not the level of dominance you expect from Kershaw, but that's by no means a bad game. Well, I think that's the biggest thing.  You see what just not necessarily in the postseason, but over the course of the regular season what win percentage teams have when they're started throws a quality start?  And I went and what percentage of Kershaw's Playoff starts have been quality starts because you know, I feel like a lot of those games he gets a bad rap for he loses three to four three two one. It's not a ton of help from his offense.  I think that narrative comes from like I'm just looking at his numbers his postseason career is 4-3-3 his career regular-season are is twofold for so that extended dominance of curse on the regular season does not come over to the postseason he needs so even if you just gives up three runs as a quality start, it just adds to the narrative that I'll Kershaw lost. But yeah. Yeah, although I made two runs is a pretty substantial difference and the amount of games. He's now pitched the postseason with Dodgers make it literally every year 31.  I started research. Yeah exactly that's starting at some point like okay. Yeah, exactly. It's like a full season of pitching is fourth. Can we see Kershaw having a 4-3-3 era in season. I mean now maybe just are not find a little bit. Yeah, three. Oh three. Oh three Euro. Yeah exactly. I mean I'd be curious to see his breakdown because in the playoffs you're facing top tier teams. I wonder what his season ERA is against teams above 500 and Below 500.  Right, you're right. If his era against teams above 500 in the regular season is closer to his postseason era. Yeah move it all over to the AL.  Yankees twins this area looks just about wrap table Yankees went into for game one. They won tonight 8:00 to 2:00. I mean, they're hitting the living cover off the ball. Are you guys doing a Gregorius is Grand Slam in the third inning? I did. Did you see his little stand and watch it fly. I did. I'm not sure.  about as nonchalant suddenly disrespectful as I've seen  It was pretty cool to watch but yeah, they've hit the cover off the ball 174 game 1 8 2 2 or no. Sorry tend to for game one eight two two today. They've scored 18 runs and 18 in a or know, I guess 16 Innings because they don't hit the bottom of the ninth. But yeah, that's serious is about then. I don't know who start I think odor. Is he starting for the Twins game three on Monday. They actually I don't know if you guys saw the twins started Randy dope neck.  day who rookie was an Uber driver 10 months ago and  I think they saved odor is he because he's more of a flyball pitcher. He's one of the highest in the MLB as far as flyball rates and that's never that's that's really smart when you're playing Yankee Stadium. Yeah, that's why oh, yeah.  Is the twins pitching has been obvious more? They walk 16 guys eight in each game - yeah, like what the with the Yankees you walk a guy and I don't care who's in the light of one through nine. Someone can take you yard, especially playing at Yankee Stadium. I saw Nelson Cruz pimp a home run in game one that barely got out of made with and it would not have gotten out of that emu or any college field. That's 330 down the line 314 barely Skies out and those firms pivoted. So I mean Alison, welcome. Welcome to New York if you is, I know that  Win set the record for most home runs this year. But if you look at the Yankees lineup up and down there's not a hole in that lineup Yankees were like what what all for something they were not want to walk and stand no hit three home runs this year. Yeah and stay and they all had all those injuries. Yeah. Yeah. I think I heard a much Miss time and Sanchez Miss time, but their worst hitter might be Gregorius and he had a grand slam today and Gardner was one of their well, I put in quotes worst hitters and he's he was super hot and September 27 home runs this yeah, I doubt if I mean,  And he's hitting in the three hole right now. He's in the three hole both game. So far this year. He's yeah, he's been fantastic. I hold yeah, he's now they're gonna die. Oh boy. That's scary. That's Carolina. No, I mean you look at their lineup lemahieu leading off. He's been one of the best if not the best hitter in baseball this year as far as contact getting on base judging the two Old Judge Gardner is hot as anybody hitting in the three hole in Carnac Stones, finally healthy hidden fourth Stanton hitting fifth kleber hitting six twos.  Played tremendous this series and all season really 39 home runs Gary Sanchez hitting seventh Didi Gregorius hitting eighth and Geo Rochelle who hit over 300 this year sitting night. I don't know of any team that's got a guy hitting over 300 over the course of a season in the nine hold as ridiculous. And Gary seems is hitting seventh who holds the record. I believe for fewest games to a hundred home runs in the entire Al not just catchers Al history.  And he said see if the Astros the Astros pitching staff and slow him down because it's right now shaping up that that's giving the ALCS. Well, I think yeah, I think the Yankees Achilles heel is their starting rotation. Yeah, but obviously the twins have not been able to get anyone out of the lineup or out of there as Tanaka went, you know, five innings seven case and Lupin who pitch game 1 the Yankees - doesn't matter.  Doesn't matter who they start we're gonna win. They won't start the game against Houston, but and I said this last pod if the Yankees can get one of two if the series sets up so that you got Verlander Cole game 1 and 2 and Houston at the Yankees can get one of those games. I think they have just as good of a shot. If not a better shot to beat the Astros in the ALCS.  I see that but we're not there yet. Still got a little ways to go yet. That is very true. Move it all to the other side of the a ODS Astros take game 1 6 2 to ashes are currently up one to zero at the end of 4: sneller going right now game one Verlander Verlander and seven Innings one hit.  Glass tile didn't pitch a terrible game, but you know the Astros lineup. Can I go ahead and declare that series over? Yeah, you've facing Verlander: Greinke the first three games in a five-game series depends on tonight if they come comeback win tonight. I think they still got chance, but if the Astros win, but I don't think they will Cole was the second hottest picture on the planet right now behind Justin Verlander.  And he's got to leave now. I just even if they come back and win tonight. I cannot see the and I don't know if it'll lineup. If the Astros can get a just have Verlander: Greinke start over the five-game series. There is no way the Rays beat those three guys three different times in five games just for reference to not his cult called as four Innings one hit seven gaze. Yeah and Verlander gave up one.  Hitting game one. Yep. Oh, yeah, we're talking we're talking to the slim chances here. Even if it's a pretty slim chance to raise went a given like maybe 20% but that they chance well, my thought process is I'm going to go ahead and declare it over.  It's probably over. Anyway, I said 98% chance. I'll take that 2 percent chance because if I'm the Yankees, I'd much rather play the raised in the ALCS. So either way I'm fine with the result. Yeah. I'm not I'm not disagreeing with you just saying there's a chance. Oh, yeah, I'm fully aware Franklin went yard tonight. That's how the Astros have scored their first run out too vain to run shot last night.  You know a couple other just you know, Doubles Doubles Doubles, welcome to the Astros lineup because as good as the Yankees lineup is used to matches up decently. Welcome to no. Yeah. No, I agree. I would when you're running out Springer out to vape Brantley bregman Alvarez, goryeo. And when Korea is your seven header like, you know, I think the Yankees have the edge in the lineup just by a tad. They definitely have the bullpen Edge in the Astros definitely have the rotation Edge. I think they match up really  Yep. Can you talk a little bit about like it's not just baseball butts like sports in general now seems to be going towards you either tanking or you put together super team and baseball written B Cup last couple years. Have you noticed it's kind of starting to go that way as well. I'm not sure if it's coincidence because the Astros developed all these guys and the Yankees developed all these guys, but it's yeah that I used some developed all these guys without tank is the thing. So yeah.  Yankees the time there was no teams challenging them really for that title back. Then there's a good teams but not this level not this many good teams.  I think he's an Astros are I think in their own tear right now? Yeah, Phillies Phillies good teams back the late 2000s early. So 20 times they would not touch not the top three teams baseball sheer. They want to touch him. Well, I think that's I think that's the one thing that Mo be does different than the other sports is you know, you tank in basketball. Do you want Zion Williamson job Moran or do you want the 20s or do you want the 14th overall?  I'll pick who probably isn't going to be a superstar in baseball your eighth round pick out of some Juco could be your star player in five or six years. I think tanking is kind of it's not as important. I think that diluting your major league system for prospects as smart. Acquiring is mini Prospect again. That's what the Braves did to become to get to the spot there at I mean, they traded everyone I mean they were picking up a guy like Luke Farrell I believe.  Shana Madoff free agency get his trade value just a little up and you deal them to Texas for you know, just two random prospects. Hey, they might work. Hey, they might now they didn't but you know what? I mean, and that's that maybe that's the way teams are taking now is they're just signing guys getting the trade value up and shipping them somewhere else but drinking in MLB. I don't think of everything and it goes hand-in-hand because I mean if you're selling off all your major league Talent you're doing that with the  Not expectation, but being fully aware that your team is going to be terrible and you're going to be competing for a top pick, but I don't think tanking and itself for draft picks is quite as incentivised in the MLB just because I mean you met you saw the Tigers pick the case e mais. Yeah, he's not going to make his debut for almost a year and a half like  You just don't see I mean Zion is going to come in for the Pelicans and play immediately and probably the their best player. If not, he's going to start immediately and you may get one guy in the majors if he's not a boss that plays in a year and a half and then to wait for your next topic to play. It's going to be another year and a half. So now you're sitting in one guy makes such of a such a smaller impact in baseball too. I mean you saw the actor is it took them five or  Years of being absolutely pitiful and then another 2-3 years of contending but not being quite good enough. And now the last three years they finally turned it on. But yeah, it makes you want to give a shout out to those small Market teams. Like we saw that in the actually a wild card gasp Champa Bay AL Wild Card O is a role in the majors are consistently competitive. Yep. It's a wild card game is almost like a celebration of the to to the  best of the lowest payrolls like that a is and raised. Yeah, they have some down to have some bad years, but that's to be expected but they're consistently like every ten years paper have three four seasons that are pretty good and that's hard to do but their payroll so shout out to them good job athletes you define to get over that hump at some point, but the Rays good on them. Ya Tek Tek Alum Eric neander does a great job down there in Tampa Bay is the GM and  I think in it surprised me a little bit. But then again it doesn't surprise me. Tampa Bay has the lowest payroll in the MLB this year and then to have them playing in the ALDS right now is pretty insane. What does that tell you about? Some of the other GM's for some of these higher payroll teams that did I mean, I guess dombrowski's out now in Boston believe they had at least top three highest payroll in baseball. If not the highest payroll in baseball and not even making the playoffs.  I think cash does such a good job with that team though as like her manager. Oh my gosh. Yeah just such a good job with them. Just getting like what like exactly like diadem and you're out since July and they're like, yeah, you know, we're gonna fucking his leadoff spot right here go ahead and tank and he hits one and I mean no no other managers doing that in baseball. I mean, what is it looks stupid if it didn't work out. Yeah, but hey, it worked out so it looks more. Yeah.  It's all about lucky spot more Smokey smart more often than you look dumb. And if that's the case then you're probably smart.  So I'm also sitting here playing the show right now and I pulled hater out of a headliner packed. So that's nice but moving on right now. We have also the founder of  life Outdoors right now  Jordan break catcher Eastern Mennonite University starting of college life Outdoors. Thank you for coming to the studio AKA Apartment 204 at no 38. Welcome glad to have you here. Thanks for having me man. Not too far will walk over here from where I'm living. Yeah, all the way across is right across the street. Yeah, let's let's just get right into it. Uh, so baseball has always been a big part of your life. I'm assuming football was too but how much did how much is based?  I mean to you today in throughout, you know, your entire life. Um, I want to say honestly it's been a really big part in like who I've become and like I guess my character and everything but like I said with football that was kind of like the I guess Foundation of like being an athlete and I had a really good football coach in high school, but like being in the weight room for all that all transferred over to baseball and I was able to be more successful in  ball and I felt got to you know fall in love with it more and I mean, it's giving me kind of a purpose, you know to come to college like I mean, you know how I am I hate school with a passion but being able to come and have the crop camaraderie with you know, the team and being able to have fun at practice every day and it's just something that is really became a part of my life and a big role of you know, why I'm in college and  Absolutely. I feel you 100% on that one. Now phone it back the high school. Like there are obviously some difficulty differences between high school and college our Old Coach coach pots used to say the game speeds up almost at the college level and the guys who can slow it down quicker are the best how have you taken that in the the difficulty swinging in the difference between high school and college baseball? Um, I know like the fall freshman year coming in, you know getting to know guys, not really, you know knowing  What you're about to get into like because it's just enter squads against, you know, you're in a team and then you know, it's transform over into spring and you get thrown out there for you know a pinch at bat and my first step out against Penn State Altoona had to dude up. I think he was like 90 92 just straight gas and in high school you a good pictures probably sitting 80 honestly at least where I'm from in from Roanoke.  The the baseball there is not as competitive as you know, some of the guys from Nova or Chesapeake or what have what have you but I know that you know, once I got my freshman year under my belt and into last year it kind of all, you know slow down with, you know, having an approach at the plate just the actual defense piece of it too. I mean caching is not really something that really speeds up.  I mean obviously if you have like your veto guys or whatever catch that but you just got more time to relax I guess once you have that year under your belt and then  that way you can be a little more successful with guys that have higher Vilas like I know last year against you know Nick Roth from Randolph-Macon that dude just straight shoves and I know if out of Face Time freshman year which I didn't I would have gotten my doors blown off but you know having it being able to have an approach in a year under your belt I think that that definitely is helped but I'd say that would be yeah I mean I got my experience exact same thing coming in freshman year I didn't know what to expect and either  You know guys in my area can typically one of their decently balance um5 in the Nova area, but still it was almost like just the pace of play The Hustle the grind of college baseball was so much different and think, you know anything else I ever experienced.  What do you feel like you do best on the field? Um  I'd say probably the hitting piece like yeah, I'm probably in an average to maybe possibly below average. I know I've gotten better prepared freshman year and you know, I could when I got here I could barely freaking catch a ball but then like the more experienced I got and everything more comfortable. I got behind the plate and knowing our staff. I got one more comfortable but the hitting part I've always been able to hit but then when you get into, you know guys again with higher Vila.  You can get into swamps and then you get hard on yourself because you don't think you can hit and you suck whatever but I definitely think my bat has helped me stay successful and and get in the lineup on I know last year, you know with re going down. I kind of got thrown out there because by default, I mean you were out with your elbow, but just being able to you know, put the ball in play and that really got me a spot, you know catching on weekends. And you know, I got my first conference start last week or last  here and yeah, I think the bat probably is my best asset right now. Yeah, thanks. Yeah. I mean, I agree. You stroke the ball don't be too hard on yourself about defense defense defense. Yeah, you little banged up right now real payment bone hamate bone, right? Yep, the hamate. Um again, thank you Nick Roth for that. Don't know if you want to hear this but end up having a hairline fracture in it.  I was out for the fourth week now actually get it off Tuesday. Let me see if I can make it for the black and blue I doubt it, but  Oh, well, well without with that being said, what are your expectations for you this year, especially in the spring I know for the spring while I mean being off this whole fall. I'm going to have to catch up because I'm behind you got a lot of news like technology stuff. That coach Miller has brought to us. So I have a lot of catching up to do but I know as like sitting back and watching all the practices and the other squads, I think our team is going to be you know,  I think pretty well balanced. I mean we've been stroking the ball last couple days guys on our staff have been chucking it, but I'm expecting to you know, be top three and no tax this year because I know like last year would be the top four teams at least once and I mean, they lost some guys and we didn't really lose too many guys off the staff lost a couple bats in the lineup. Other than that, I definitely think we're  Be a top team this year and I'm excited to see what what happens. There is big-time man. That's big time. So get on a more personal note, you are the founder of college life Outdoors, then run it all you sponsor the Pod we've doubted you out almost every single time Big Time, I'd say entrepreneurship that you're into not merge all of it. So tell me how it got started and where you plan on going with it. So honestly, I was I was in  My dorm freshman year and fall season it ended everything and I mean then the fall that's when hunting season comes around and I was sitting there watching YouTube and I was like, I think I'm you know, enjoy having a YouTube channel and I kind of just started, you know, self-filming some like hunts and everything. I was like, you know, I think I would be, you know kind of successful with like maybe an outdoor company or something. So I started you know, just  In about brainstorming whatever I like what I would even call my YouTube channel, whatever and I was like college life Outdoors kind of sounds, you know, like it would stick. So I went ahead and made a logo for it made it Instagram and the Instagrams kind of taken off more than you know, you two because it's hard being able to go on a hunt film it and play baseball go to practice on top of homework to that's  How much usually are the last thing I get to yeah, I hear you brother. But yeah, once I got the Instagram going and saw that kind of took off that's when I was like, you know, I'm gonna drop some hats got the hats out we have.  I think I've sold close to over a hundred now and this is only been within less than 12 months. I think eyes so definitely has been  An interesting experience and I want to continue to keep doing that. I know you know, I'll be graduating next year. So the whole name side of it cause life outdoors. I don't know how well this is going to keep sticking but for like future guys that come through, you know, emu I'm hoping they'll keep the brand going. So we'll see it's been a really cool experience. I got to meet a lot of cool people that I grew up watching hunting shows and everything. So now that's legit.  That's legit and catch you on what Twitter Youtube Instagram Instagram Twitter. The link is in my personal Instagram.  I haven't posted I don't know how I have like three videos on my Channel right now. Like I said, I hadn't really put much effort into the YouTube part of it. I've been more on the Instagram because I feel like a lot of people are using Instagram more. Okay. So Instagram is a lot easier to get to yeah lot more accessible. But yeah, definitely go hit me up with a follow. Yeah. Appreciate it. Of course check them out last two questions. We're trying to ask everyone. Who is your favorite Major League hitter of all time.  the president doesn't matter  I feel like the most you know cliche answer would be David Ortiz, but that's just because I grew up Red Sox fan Big Papi always just just his mentality and it comes to the plate like everybody's going to hit he's gonna get out part and that's kind of the mentality. I like to have to when I'm playing for also grew up watching, you know, Albert Pujols in his prime.  that dude to this day just wide being able to watch him just  He was Unreal. I mean I know as he gets older he's been slipping been struggling but my dad's a cards fan just got beat go Braves, right? That's right, baby go bright. But yeah, I think those two guys are you know, their mentality and the way that they just swing the bat is definitely somebody that I admire.  Yeah now Big Papi in the machine to big-time pics and last but not least. It was one picture past or present. You could Step In The Box and see their best stop one time. Who would it be? Hmm?  honestly  I'd say probably around is Chapman. I think I'll because you know going off the hack attack and we're catching a practice you were catching goofing off catching a hundred ten, you know, I just would like to see what I be able to do in the Box against that if I would even see it or get a bit get the bat to it. But just his rahl velocity has to be something I'd like to try to hit. Oh, yeah, most of the most dominant clothes over the last 10 years to be able to pump it 100.  I've yeah, that's a great pick. But yeah. Again, thank you Jordan for stopping by the studio again. Go check them out at college life Outdoors Twitter Instagram YouTube. It's all there. It's Big Time Business. Thank you Jordan. Thank you.  And we're back. Thank you to Jordan break for That interview. Thank you for taking time. Again. Go check out his Instagram Twitter and YouTube page at college life Outdoors good stuff going on over there. Now. We're going to get back to our weekly segment of top tens. Thank goodness. We have gay back so we can argue a little bit because me and Ryan's are always basically on the same page first baseman this week will start over it will start as an option if our top three or any different at all. I'm going to personally  About there and smack you all know. No, I will I will delete I said that cast we never record anything ever again. I will delete it off anchor I would leave it off Spotify. I will unfriend both of you from my life and we'll call today number ones Ryan Howard.  Now weird, huh one time. Okay, it's been real. All right, we're doing this Prince Fielder has kicked off at 10:00. All right, I got Mickey number 10 just sliding in he could have been higher. He honestly could have been would not at all blame you if you wanted to hire, but he's been fantastic throughout his career very consistent. He wants triple crown for years ago, which has not been done and  How many years before that nail 40 or something extreme ski, right. Yeah, that's right. It's 60s. That's right Ryan. That's 67. Maybe you something like that something like that. But yeah, he's been fantastic. He started to decline a little bit but even still this year. He wasn't bad news healthy. So we'll see how he goes up our but he still hit him for a decent average. Yeah. He's acting Deputy CM higher but there's so many options like yeah, and if everything 3 4 through 10 is just that yeah, that's the beauty of it. Yeah it is I think for three  R10, there's a couple guys. It probably are a little higher but there's so many for through probably 25 30 girl. You could make an argument for them being in the top 10 and you can make an argument for them being number 30.  Like someone like Bill Terry. Yeah. Anywho sorry go ahead Ryan. Kick us off that he got got Joey Votto at Tim one of the best first baseman of the last 20 years kind of little bit different style than a typical first baseman a lot of pop but not necessarily the sellout homerun guy you'd think of great vision doesn't strike out a ton kind of on the decline now, but now he's been wanting a VPS.  He's had a heck of a career coming in at number 10. I don't know if this surprise picked it up you two, it probably is I have is I'm gonna call almost the upgraded version of Joey Votto the slight tick off. I went with Todd Helton and number 10. Oh, yeah played in Colorado all those years those numbers look inflated, but 316 average for 4414 OBP 953. Oh PS the raw numbers, don't lie.  Why he's almost like he's literally almost of take off and Joey Votto and everything. He was never played, you know the steroid era but he was never that big Masher out in Colorado. He was just consistent year in year out was I think he was a staple out there almost like when I think Colorado like growing up I always thought Todd Helton. I know it. He he wasn't like in-your-face flashy, you know, like he wasn't McGuire Giambi excetera, etc, etc. But he was so consistent so good.  So many years surprisingly only got five All-Star games out of them. But again, that's due to the just Mass first baseman home run hitting first baseman's in the area he fled but yeah, Todd Helton slide into the are my number 10 spot. Yeah, you just missed my list. I gave the nod to Votto more due to the fact and I know helped me was one of the best doubles hitters that we've seen in baseball ever and but I think part of that is due to playing in Colorado. Yeah. It's a doubles Haven. It's a homerun Haven and the  fact that I think you said help was a little bit upgraded version of Votto but I think you can attribute some of that course field. I'd be curious to see what his numbers would have been like for his career had he not played half his games in Coors Field. Yeah. That's I mean, it's plenty Fair Point. You can't argue with that for me. I would say kobato's slightly over. Yeah help me but they're if you commit sorry comparing arrows, they're like basically same player. They are so identical. They're super undervalued based the sea they play in and they just go into the radar beer, but beer.  Just the excellent every single year. Yeah in about it vato was just slipped off my list. I had them at 11:00, so  Go into number nine Gabe Jim Thome. Hmm.  That's all I have to say about you told me he was a beast. You know, I'm dongs fair for I got Frank Thomas fun player to watch again kind of right-handed. Tummy essentially a lot of dongs.  I actually also have Jim Thome. Hey, not much to say that you could actually crush the ball at 612 career home runs was I mean, he was fun to watch very fun. We wrote memorable batting stance. I can say that much. I'll never forget his last season. He came back to the Phillies fans just absolutely loved him because of his time previously with them hits it hits a walk off home run against the Rays I think and that's even though the Phillies kind of sucks from that year on I still remembered as one of the best food  Moments of my life time. That was just a really cool moment seeing Jim tell me coming back. So stomping grounds and hit a walk-off home run really cool.  All right. Ryan number eight good Johnny Mize great career played earlier in the 30s to 40s 20s. And yeah played for a while good career. Not necessarily somebody that jumps off the page, but he's one of those earlier guys that you don't necessarily think about but when I was digging into the numbers, I couldn't keep him off my top 10.  I actually am awesome wrong with Johnny Mize right there. Again, his numbers really pop out two-time All-Star. It sucks. He missed three years of his career due to military service. I think he would have skyrocketed up this list if he had missed age 32 33, those all those were prime years of his career home run hitting years doubles All-Star sucks that he missed it. But I mean who didn't in that time?  Johnny my Johnny Mize at 8:00. I thought this might be a little debatable. I put Hank Greenberg number eight and I know y'all gonna have them later so I won't do it thunder to do much but one of the things that caught my eye is very last season. He led baseball and walks with a hundred over a hundred blocks in just six like around 615 plate appearances. That is awesome. He didn't have a super high batting average power that year, but it just tributes how good of a hitter he was and he also lost three years of military service. I'm sure you're gonna put one more in depth on him later. So I'll leave it at that.  that  Well, if you're gonna leave it at that, I'll just go ahead and get number seven off that with uh with Greenberg. I went with Green Park here for the exact same reasons. I went with my eyes. His numbers were slightly better two-time MVP Hall of Famer in 17 career. Oh PS like it doesn't get much better than that. Obviously. None of us. Saw him play. None of us. Got to see him play.  But he missed three years of his career as Gabe said his last year the last year really stood out as those in there looking at baseball-reference that he led the league in walks in his last year shows that he may still had a little bit some left in the tank but you know life moves on but yeah Greenberg, I haven't seven.  Did you have a set of locking in at number seven for me? I've got Dan Brothers Brothers Brothers Brothers Brothers. If you look at the top statistical categories for batters, he at one point led the league in nine of them, which is pretty incredible that I think the only time he didn't lead the league and was stolen bases and the fun fact the only player to ever lead the league.  In every category at one point in their career is Ty Cobb. Wow, and so Dan brooders knocks off nine of those 10 categories. The only one being stolen bases, which you don't really expect from the first baseman anyway, so he was my one pre-1900 guy on the list.  All right for number seven. I had probably another one you might need a little bit low, Jeff Bagwell. This is pretty outstanding player part of the Killer Bees and noughties Astros teams really thought of those teams. Usually more thought of Berkman. I'm sorry Biggio. Yeah. I don't know. Why because she it was more heike than that. Well was because back well was the Big Bopper the team like you never really got caught the steroids. I don't think unless I'm mistaken and just consistently excellent.  Just your and you're out good defensive first. Baseman to very good player. That's our statement. Good pick good pick moving on to 6. I'm Gonna Roll with Miguel Cabrera again growing up. We he was one of the biggest obviously one of the most well-rounded hitters as we all were growing up two-time MVP won the Triple Crown you touched on them already. He was one of the few people in the trout era, too.  Taking him to be away from drought. Yeah, but now Mickey has been a staple in the game for the last pin 15 years as he's fall. It sucks to see him fall off the way he is now, but yeah, maybe it Mickey. It's six.  Yeah, I've got a bag well at six for me for the same reasons Gabe hit great hitter in the middle of the steroid era, but recent Hall of Fame inductee great career. And like you said a little doesn't quite get the recognition he deserves on some of these Astro teams. I think you kind of think of Biggio before Bagwell but Bagwell tremendous sitter. I've always found that odd because usually it's like being only getting all the attention. Yeah. It was exactly a super  Flashy player so I don't know it was weird. Yeah, I don't know why but Bagwell definitely doesn't get I don't think he's put in the same level as Cabrera and some of the other guys we're gonna talk later. Yeah, even though you've got act well ahead of Cabrera on your list I do. But anywho for me honestly four through ten are pretty interchangeable. I was just like try scrambled put this list together last second because  I may have been I've had a lot of pressure on me to get it done. So yeah, I just can't do this. I was that, you know knowing you growing up for the last 10-15 years you tend to spend maybe a little bit more time on things than you need to and I will agree with that very thorough. I am way too thorough my about you see my algorithm so mark it is I don't do nope. Nope. Yeah, just picture it. Nope. I remember I remember.  Next time class and you be like look, here's my Gulf school homework. This is one problem. You'd be like six pages of notes. I'd be like, that's one problem Gabe. What on Earth are you doing? I still remember the gate gate has after a cure of cancer on here. So we have graduated and I was about to start senior year. I was talking to you about annotations for AP English. Oh my God, and I was like, oh, yeah, it only took me. I mean I worked on it for probably 10 hours over two days and you were like, yeah, I worked on it for six days straight nose.  Sleep Monster Energy is everywhere. Guess what? I think we both got a honey. Did we say? Oh my gosh, the summer English rings are ya long story short. I'm going to throw everything. Oh my gosh. But yeah, so okay. Anywho number six for me Frank Thomas, big Frank doel ya think, dude.  That's why I was like who's actually good. Never mind.  Yeah.  No.  Ryan idiot at it six. I got Bagwell Bagwell. Yeah, we're still on six. Yeah. I actually also have Bagwell at six. Hey, it's awesome. I honestly y'all may have thought of busy hilberg me when I think the Astros. I always thought of Bagwell because of the stance Drew that's I was a big stance Intimidator, you know out in the yard gave my the one to be, you know, Roy Holliday or whoever around the yard though into the into the wall, but I was so broke. I  Thank you very much. That's not me now, please I'm out. Thank you, Ryan Sheffield of Wiffle ball. But yeah, I was a big stance and impersonator. So I always thought of Bagwell again his numbers don't lie.  One of the one of the better War sevens out of any first baseman's I was surprised I was honestly surprised when bag was numbers were so good. When I look them up. Yeah, I like off, you know, Joe left on my head. I was thinking yeah, but you know bottom tints probably and then when he has I would say significantly better numbers than maybe some guys when I think of the, you know, early mid 2000s when I think of McGuire Giambi and all of them and bagwell's numbers almost blow them out of the water, especially when it comes like longevity-wise I was  Be mind-blowing about that. But yeah bag will Falls. They're mentally I always put Bagwell and like someone like Fred McGriff in the exact same category as same time period there's both really the first baseman. So I just mentally like kind of tie them together, but there was a huge difference Bagwell significant other. Yeah, so I as I open, right? Yeah now some of these I guess four positions, but I've been kind of surprised by a few guys after digging  In the numbers, there's a lot of guys that you either a thought were a lot better than their numbers show or what you've got the flip side guys that really went under the radar compared to their number you'd think after looking at the numbers that they don't quite get the recognition that they deserve. Yeah. Yeah Bagwell was my number 5. I'm 99% Sure.  You just said you had him six. Yeah, I know but you said six but I'm 99% sure I had him at 5 because I went held him tell me mais Greenberg making. Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's right. Let's run five now. Yes, we're on five. I got us kicked off at five Bagwell five. Thank you very much. You cannot Johnny Mize five for me for the reasons. You all said earlier.  Yeah, I've got Hank Greenberg at 5:00 when you dig into the numbers. He really only played nine and a half full seasons in the majors. He missed.  Four and a half Seasons from age 30 to 34 due to military service and I'm not gonna knock that against him at all. It's one thing to miss chunks of Seasons due to injury it's another thing to miss four and a half years is right in your Prime because you're serving our country during World War 2 when you dig into the numbers a career 313 hitter over a thousand o PS4 his career 1935 led the mo be in home runs and RBIs 1938 hit.  38 home runs and walked a hundred and nineteen times over 1100. Oh PS 41 home runs a hundred and 50 RBIs in 1942. Go along with 50 doubles. He went on a stretch from 1937 to 1940 where he had a no PS of over one won three out of four seasons, and then he misses four and a half Seasons due to plane in the military or not plane.  Serving in the military and he gets back his first full season after coming back from the military 1946. He is 35 years old and proceeds to lead the MLB in home runs and RBIs just an incredible career. His numbers really shortened career, but also won 2 MVPs, I mean, I would love to see what numbers he would have put up had he not miss four and a half Seasons due to military time.  Hay rides John time to play in the Air Force after college. Yeah. Yeah, we all play in the Air Force. All right, so let's go five or is that for ya gave you? All right - yeah. Okay. Well moving on to top four. Okay. Go ahead Dan Brothers Brothers. I don't know. Yeah, thank you Justin. Well, yeah, right. I was actually really interesting.  Is that you threw out there earlier Ryan so - you're really appreciate that you the six-time batting champion. He played for such Brilliance well-known teams as the Troy Trojans. Buffalo Bisons. Yes, plural not singular Detroit Wolverines the Boston beaneaters the Boston Reds, not the Red Sox the Reds the Brooklyn Grooms Baltimore Orioles the previous iteration the Louisville coat kernels.  The Philadelphia Phillies the New York Giants just guidance. I think I've heard of three of those 81 teams and also fun fact license. Yeah, fun fact, he played his last I'm supposed to be his last game in 1898 came back age 46 like 1904 play two games for the New York Giants. So yeah, Julio Franco 2.0 not quietness right goes away. Oh Franco 2.0. Yeah. He was so old he probably  that point  Yeah, well, this is about the point in my list where I say the reason that I left brothers and cap Anson off where because they played in. I don't know seventeen-b see or something, but that's my own take anyways moving on Ryan number for you. Go Cabrera. Hi Mystique. Yeah, I I do. I'm a little biased because I grew up watching him play. He's one of the few first baseman on the list. I guess it's just him boulos. So I'm going to give that one away, but that's pretty  Obvious and Votto that we've really seen growing up. I mean we saw Thomas we saw Bagwell we saw helping but those guys were more when we were younger watching Cabrera. He's one of the best pure hitters I've ever seen he might not have the power numbers is some of these other first baseman have and quite the longevity but  my goodness watching him hit from 2008 to about 2013-14. I don't know that there's any hitter I would have rather had on my team to Miguel Cabrera may be other than pool hosts. But and like you said a Triple Crown first one since you stransky in the late 60s just incredible header and like we touched on earlier you can make a case for any of these guys sitting for through about 25.  And you say that's not much power. But I mean he want a few home run championships in Comerica Park. That's the homerun Champion ships. You know what I mean home runs.  550 550 home run  Of numbers were some of the best on this list again. He was a beast. He was not a guy you want to reckon with he led the league in oh PS three or four straight years. He was an intimidating Factor at the plate. I mean / line 301 419 555 974 for his career, even when his power kind of sort of fell off. His average was still there his offensive score on Angry laughs its Force out of all first baseman.  It's just a little you know, a little little piece to embarrass button right here was from or fangraphs actually baseball-reference most the time you bump. I'm just kidding. But sorry Frank, you know Frank won 2 MVPs in the Hall of Fame. That's I his offense was so unbelievable. That's why I'm of it for   Rolling into the top three so we can just repeat ourselves over and over and over again. Nice. Nice. Well, someone started off at 3:00. All right me. Yeah, I've got Fox of three as well. Yeah, we all have foxes three. Yep. Nice. Which means all right one to yep behind Google.  Well, I mean, I'll throw out some stuff on Jimmie Foxx and three-time MVP a nine-time All-Star won two World Series, but I literally have it written down here numbers. Don't lie. They're unbelievable. Jimmy Fox numbers actually never lie. 7 does not equal 8, so coming into the number-2 spot.  You know the more I'm looking at this the more I want to rethink it.  Right now I'm gonna drive out there and I'm gonna slap you upside the head. Okay, but I'm going to make a case for you that.  It's closer than you'd think which way is it is three of them to closer or two in one closer. Which way are you talking to you in three months two and one? Okay, nevermind. I didn't know if you would probably agree without counting stats are closed. Other than that, I mean, okay. Yeah. I've got pullo's it too good, but  Well, I also do you know, yeah, I know.  Put those in your mouth first baseman in MLB history most home runs of any first baseman most RBIs 300 career average. Derek's got him beat good and average and OBP slugging. Oh PS o PS plus wait Gehrig.  Not Giambi you did a beautiful job. Whatever. I'm supposed to. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, he's not even know I'd top 20. Yeah. No, but I pull host. I mean it's not really disputable pull. Her says the are Edge and Counting stats, but when you dig into stat lines Advance numbers, it's Gary.  But I would be curious to see had pull ups not really fallen off the last three four years.  It would be closer than you think.  What would have happened if I hadn't fallen off about it? But yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean he was that guy who for our entire lifetime growing up was our Falls was the man there was no there was no question about it. There was no argument about it. Our Paul's was the dude.  No one want to pitch to him he hit for average. He had power you did everything you could want out of player.  Yeah, it sucks with the angels at the he has fallen off. I believe at one point is averages seasoned it Bulova below 300. I think it's back up now. Yeah, it is. That's what I was about to say many factors in his backup, but he needs to just call it quits but he's he's not going to and I kind of had don't blame him because he'd be leaving a lot of money on the table if he walks out now, I mean, you're a lot for a hall-of-fame spot at this point. Wow, he better be a unanimous Hall of Fame. He was a locked.  Years ago. Yeah, he was that good. I was just when I was doing research. So this tells you how good pull those well as I was doing research. I pulled up a top-10 first baseman article flung from Bleacher Report in 2008. Yep. I look the same. They had Flows at number five all time back in O8. Yeah. He had played for seven years.  Yeah, he was the my childhood that are seven or eight years. Yeah. No. Yeah incredible crew. Now the angels have both of them. They should be amazing bro. Not with that being competent front office. But gave anything I'll ever pulled you wanna say. No pretty much hit on the head one last thing about big old Albert. He is falling off, but he's aged 39 and he runs.  I walk but the I think the unbelievable thing about balls is that he still 823 out this year. Yeah. He's still drove in 94 runs this year and he still had a respectable 734. Oh PS which I mean if it wasn't on a huge contract those numbers would look significantly better.  But for being 39 and for being as broken down as he is, he's still putting up decent Seasons. Yeah, so I'm gonna have a video was somewhere on YouTube. I saw video of like Albert Pujols how slow the runner he is. It was really funny.  Yeah, he is like so doing a little more number digging here while we're kind of wrapping up. I know you guys laugh me off for even considering poulos and Gary, but if you look at just through and I know it's a culmination of a career if you look at pool host through age 30 and Garrick through age 30. It is extremely close.  Well Gehrig obvious obviously is the better career, but just after the Pod take a look at pull host through age 30 and Gehrig through age 30 Gehrig's RBI numbers are obviously a little inflated from the era. But well thank goodness. People play Fast age 30  I did I not just say that.  Just just take a look at Derek through 30 and Pull-Ups.  Probably to let him just move it in number one the obviously Garrick a paradise obvious than usual. Hey, hey. Hey. Hey. Aah, what did play If you're looking specific positions stem usual. It did play more games at first base and he did any other specific position specific more.  All reference doesn't have him as a first baseman. Anyways, Lou Gehrig number one.  Highly side because they had this argument on our text Texas group for like an hour and I was really bothering me. I think I think I think it was like 10 minutes an hour. I'm trying to do homework. Just Justin and I are able to respond within a few minutes for you a 10-minute text chain feels like an hour.  The numbers don't lie 340 batting average 493 home runs Hall of Fame two-time MVP. Six times World Series winner was part of the you know, those Yankee squads numbers. Don't lie. Well, I'll be back. I am looking at it. Now. I think he is also one of the only players that led the league in 9 out of 10.  Categories again, the only one being stolen bases. He actually led the league in triples in 1926. He had 20 triples that then since the fences were so different like the deeper ballparks if her powerful my troubles, so if you look at Polo Grounds, no, but for a first baseman to I mean he didn't have more than 17 stolen bases and he only had three seasons of double-digit stolen bases and foot to then lead the league in triples. I mean everybody sitting with those  The defense has yeah, that's right. That's not necessarily the counting total. But the fact that he would delete my point being it's usually more powerful guys than had a chance to lately triples not speed guys. Yeah metallic. Definitely help one. Fun fact. I saw David Ortiz hit a triple and Tropicana Field.  And then you woke up that actually happened. Wow, the one raised game I went to and Tropicana. It was like 2010 or 11 and he hit a triple and care my just like fall into a coma or something and seraphim are in the major leagues. You know, what exactly that's my point like Rocco baldelli your cocoa.  That brings back so many bad memories. We gotta be so pissed once we're done with this. We got to make a list favorite obscure players their mm. Mm. How about Felix? PA 1 plus 1 p.m.   Past week has gone above and beyond in the postseason. I'm going to let Gabe start us off right now Stephen Strasburg. He is throw nine innings, including three in the playoff. By the way, we comments about this Scherzer pitching relief earlier Strasbourg came in relief in the wild-card game and that close Brewers game and he pitched his butt off three Innings of shutout ball, and he was one of the Tribune back bus still on.  Are you gonna run? Yeah, I'm glad he pitched very well in the wild-card game and left gave a national chance to win the game which they did and it in through a grate in the game two against the Dodgers and give them a Fighting Chance Net series two games now and Washington they got a thanks Jean the on the bump on Sunday always a chance to win reserves on the mound. So hey, I've got a good chance to win because she  For he's pitched really well and as well as throw a side note, we're going to I don't know how Strasbourg Tommy John surgery had been this but he came out as one of the most hyped pitching prospects of all time got her and afterwards literally everyone forgot about them, but he has been nothing short of awesome since he's have some years or like a but mostly I would like to debate that statement that everyone forgot about him. I think he just hasn't been the  the top five pitcher in baseball that he was hyped up to be coming out of the draft, but he has been more than a serviceable picture. Alright. Alright, it's he's got without that strikeout rates of all time. Yeah. Let me talk about like top 10 top 20 pictures baseball. He's always kind of that guy like not always but he's usually one that you have forgotten about because mostly because NASA have serger now if he was just Strasbourg, I think he will be recognized but yeah, shout out to him. He's doing a great job. He's having a great career even though yesterday out.  He is going to get paid this offseason. Yep.  I think he's got four years hundred million left on his contract. I would be shocked if he doesn't opt out and get six years in at least a hundred and fifty I'm staying.  Yep. No, I'm 100% with you on he is about to get paid or even I guess with the injury concerns. Maybe he opts out and doesn't get more length, but he gets four years a hundred and thirty to a hundred 50 range.  Yeah, it'll be interesting.  Ryan who's your who's your one star from the postseason so far David John lemahieu? He has been nothing short of incredible All Season afterthought in free agency. We've covered that really set the table for the Yankees in game one and kind of the series for them had a home run a double and a single four RBIs had a clutch hit I think to give them the lead yesterday. He's been one of the only constants in the Yankees lineup all season and continuing it in the playoffs.  Solid pick I mean he was unbelievable in the regular season. I think he's just kind of brought it along with them into the postseason.  Mine is Ian D Diaz again. I've touched on a multiple times in the pot so far.  Was on the IL for over a month as an at-bat since July, I believe it's something like that comes in.  Brian cash apparently told him about a week beforehand that he was bad and leadoff against. Minaya. That's it. They said that on the broadcast watching the game comes in and sneaks one over the wall first first at-bat of the game. I think really, you know really sent the Rays in the right direction later in the game. It's a it's a nuke out of the yard this time, but I think without Diaz that games a lot closer than it is and I don't think the raise at least even give themselves a chance versus Houston.  That's why he's my postseason quote-unquote 1 star of the week because of his wild car performance at the I mean, it's pretty unbelievable not to get a live at that for two months. Yeah, and you're stepping. It's a guy. Minaya who had an unbelievable September which is exactly why he got that star unbelievable September and to go yard off of them, you know, sneak one out first a b and then after that  hit another one.  Like a big-time big-time from Yanni Diaz.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  But I think that's about going to wrap us up this week for the Pod. Thank you Ryan and Gabe for making it especially gave this time. I'm going to thank you fall break I guess yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I guess y'all see Gabe in about a month and a half during Thanksgiving break. Actually, it's not it's not fall break, which is smart for that. They're called reading days. You're kidding me qv8. I'm not getting this.  Called. I'm a year. I love crowds.  We don't call it campus we call it grounds because learning extends into the community. That's the reason but I'm pretty sure yeah, but because he called it grounds. I think something along the lines of he didn't want the campus to be didn't want it to be isolated. He wanted it to flow out into the community and not be just a  For somebody to save labor, but yeah. Yeah. Well, yeah anyways.

I put on my long sleeve to and I put on my Beyonce sweater are we also like depressed because we had like a really rude awakening that cancer can happen to everyone. You know, I'm not depressed because Annie is like just so I'm not depressed. I'm like actually  What do I feel Wolk Wolk I hope they fucking hate that word. Why did you say that? That's a bizarre. That's so not like me, but she just like opened my eyes to a lot of different things about being ill and Outlook. Her Outlook is incredible and she's just I mean, she's a comedian so she's just fucking funny, but we're talking with any bond who at 26 I believe 26 was  Know'st with stage four breast cancer gnarly like what the fuck like that's terminal. Yeah. So anyways, how are you gave you the depression real quick? What's going on? What's going on over drinking a delicious red wine? I don't even know what this is. I just really like it. It's fresh and pure Italian and spile inspired and locally produced.  Just Vino Rosso 2015. Where did you buy this? I cannot for the life of me remember and I mean, where do I go where I buy why I want to get it. Oh, I know where I got it my local grocery store. We're gonna say something crazy. Oh, no, what you're saying is that it's not a Ralph's no. No, I mean it could be I doubt it. Fuck Ralph's. Whoa! Is this story? No, I went to a Ralph's the other day with them. I was like hanging out with my friends little girl.  Who I used to babysit when I was very young. She would be on our podcast. Yeah she too. Is she not be is she an adult now or like a teenager? She's 12. Okay. We want like a five you want a twelve-year-old really? They're very insightful. Really I would feel amazing give us attitude what grade is she has attitude, but she won't give us attitude. She's just a freshman in high school. Really? I don't think so. No, she's not in high school. She's in Middle School.  What the fuck do I know and we walked into this Ralphs and it was like a fucking Horror Story. Ralph's is a mess. Not even first of all, the place is just ugly. Like I'm like gloomy. I hate like Pavilions Ralph's all that. They're like dark and brown and fucking ugly. I'm like if I'm going somewhere to buy fresh fruit and vegetables. Can you make it like bright and Airy and that's why I like going to the farmers market 100% Well, I recently because I  Go through these phases of when I want to get like the boxed pre-made not pre-made meals but meals that you to your door, then you cook them. Yeah, because I get them and I'm like, oh, yes, I don't have to think about food and I can just do it and then I like throw everything away and I was like, oh fuck. I just like kill the environment. So anyways, I reordered a box for next week and the week after from where plated which I've never tried before. I think my mom did that it seems cool like healthy.  Z but yeah, I don't know where I was going with that but I know I like those things for a minute to I go in waves I make a salad to that has like cucumber tomato. Avocado garbanzo beans like a lot of different things and it with a lemon juice and all of them really good vegan. Tuna sandwich made out of garbanzo beans today. What are they? How did oh it was saying so good how they make it taste like tuna though. I do not wear some place.  Hollywood, I mean, I feel like this is a very you cover say that your vegans you guys aren't interested in that fuck. Don't worry. We're talking about cancer soon won't stay tuned. We just fuck to this entire bulk and weight. Here's the problem. We film our intro or we record our intro after we record the podcast and I've been drinking wine for your hours. Okay, you know what? It is a mixture that I am Tipsy and cold. I'm  I'm so fucking Clive. Jobox are shaking but also I can't really see straight. Okay? Well you guys this is gonna be a good one. Yeah ready is intro wasn't the best. This is not our best work. But but we are speaking into the mic these days. Yeah, we've learned that a closer to the mic. So maybe you can hear us are all podcasts this messy or is it just us from what I've read regarding podcasts it.  Like at least like 2000. So we're already ahead of the curve in this podcast. Again Annie Bond. We talk about cancer. We talk about abortion and Texas we talked about the fucked-up Health Care System Health Care System. Basically, this is a podcast where you want to be drinking wine, or you want to be in the car driving and be like fuck. Yeah the American policy of care system.  You know no take action. Do you get so inspired by a podcast that you actually take action? Yes. Really? Yeah, what what I'm by certain things on Thrive Market  That's all okay, buddy you all right. Thanks for listening. I hope you guys are really as Laura says woke for this week never I can we take that out. I'm not I don't say that word. No, we're not taking it out. But this was honestly the most informative podcast and we talked to Annie for almost two hours. Yeah, dude. I couldn't I just had so many questions and like she  So articulate and up. She's uplifting and funny and sarcastic all the same time. It's really awesome. Yeah, it's like the way you want to hear about how cancer can affect everyone. Yeah, essentially. So grab your wine or drive your car and say fuck the system, and we'll see you next week. Bye.  What's up? Thank you so much for coming. Yeah. Thank you so much for being here. So good. We put out like a message on gno just saying if you have a fun story or interesting story. I want to talk to us. Let us know. So what was it about that? Probably very poorly written post that got you till like right in and want to like share your story about  It yeah, so I don't know. I feel like I do have a cool story and that it's for me whenever I see it. I'm always like oh, that's a good opportunity. I also love a good talkie podcast. Hmm. Love listening to people talk all the time. And I love to hear myself talk to his works that well. No, so I got I moved to LA when I'm from Texas. I moved to LA in like 2012 2013 somewhere around there. Mmm, and I was 24 and  You know having a good time you're trying to do comedy and acting and then when I turned 26, like right before it my boyfriend was like I got a lump in your boob and I was like, oh he felt it. Leave me alone. He felt it first. So thank God filling y'all successful relationship. I lost my parents health insurance went through all this crap basically after like nine months of having doctors dismiss me. Tell me I have firm breasts. I don't have family history.  Whatever. I finally found somebody was like, oh, I think you should really get this further checked in turns out I had stage 4 metastatic breast cancer. See that shit pisses me off. It's like crazy to just see how many people you need to go through and how many different motherfucking opinions everyone has about your health and you don't know who to trust and at like after you see all these people and they keep on saying no and no I know I know. I know you're thinking to yourself. Okay? Well, they said no, maybe I should just like it's not that big of a deal.  What like continue to push you to find that person that said you have cancer like you have an instinct I guess I want to say there was some greater thing that I did but it's for some reason and I did this throughout the whole diagnosis part 2 was it's just the matter of like just the gut feeling of just knowing like this is something weird. Yeah. There's something weird. It's getting bigger. Like I don't understand like this doesn't feel right and my older sister.  Had had a benign lump removed. So I figured oh, maybe it's maybe it's nothing maybe but I remember right when I got my ultrasound the first time when I finally got like figured all that out because I also had to figure out health insurance for the first time as 26 which is nearly impossible fucking were there. I would have my finger on a thing and like went to the my first insurance I got and they charged me $800 just to like get a finger dressed. It's so ridiculous. It's vanity even my like health insurance broker is like  I'm just going to be honest with you. I've been doing this for over ten years and I don't understand it. So I don't expect you to understand it and I'm like then where does that leave like the everyone else? Yeah. I mean, that's the problem exactly. They make it so hard to figure out that even like our my parents hadn't gone through a cancer diagnosis themselves. Like they've had my grandparents had different types, but nothing that was breast or that kind of related, but it's also no one ever teaches you that when things get complicated.  Like for example, when you don't have the flu anything above that a lot of the times doctors are kind of figuring it out too. So especially something like cancer. There isn't a cure for it. There's no way to figure out how people got it for the most part like obviously if you smoke two packs a day for 80 years and you get lung cancer that probably had something to do with it. Then you have people like my boyfriend's grandma is a smoker has the healthiest lungs the doctors have seen and they don't understand it. So can't use kind.  Of that shitty luck just happens whatever thing and that's also what the responses to like. You can take a medicine that works for somebody and then it doesn't work for you. So what they don't tell you to is you have to see a bunch of doctors and get a bunch of different opinions and then you have to pick out of those opinions and I'm like, I have a college degree and acting yeah not in any type of society.  Cancer trial hundred percent unfair like the why am I wasting my time with you? And that's the problem with having either a chronic illness or I mean mine is technically a terminal illness, but I'm very lucky in that. I have been responsive to drugs for whatever reason there really is no Rhyme or Reason for it. Maybe they'll figure it out in a few years from now, but even it's like me taking the drugs I am is like, oh we're just hoping this works and if it works keep going so when you first felt that lump to you  Being diagnosed was nine months. Yeah during that time did or I don't know if you know this, but did that cancer become more aggressive. Like if someone had said nine months ago. Yeah of cancer like we can fix this. Yeah, so that was fun. So basically what happens is once you get a diagnosis, so they if you feel a lump you go in they do an ultrasound for mine. I could tell the nurses all got really quiet like after those and everyone's been a lot nicer to me and I was like, oh God, this is like, oh fuck I have cancer and they're like what you got  A biopsy like please come back and I was like, okay. Well, I just need to check on my insurance and stuff, you know the normal thing when you live in LA and you're 25 and you're like, oh everything's expensive and they're like, you know what you should just schedule it. They're like, you don't have to pay us right away like just schedule the thing and I was like, oh, that's serious. Yeah. I was like, okay. Well, let's just do it and then biopsy suck they go in and they like basically it feels like a staple gun in your like going in and they're like click click. Are you let your awake for this? Oh, yeah.  And they cut you open. No, they put like a little like a needle in basically and then they put it's like a this is if you don't like needles could ever get ready for this. Oh my God. It's a hollow needle. So it's a big Hollow needle that goes in for a biopsy and they put a smaller needle in and that is like what makes a staple gun sound. I had to get a bone biopsy and a liver biopsy and you ever biopsy one was the worst. Yeah, that one is like so this is like they just have to figure everything out. So  See anything after you get a diagnosis basically after get it biopsied. So I mean it's even like you get diagnosed that's dramatic enough and I was like at work that day is working at a restaurant, you know doing the general LA Story and I was like, oh I'm going to be fine. I'm just going to run to my results appointment and like it'll be fine and I get there and she's like so you unfortunately have breast cancer. And I remember I laughed and then she sounded like the teacher from Charlie Brown the like whoa, whoa, whoa, and I was just sitting there laughing and then I go  Go so she's like you have any questions and I go do I need to take off work and she's like, yeah and I go huh? Okay, and she was like is that it and I go yeah, it just figures with that was my response to getting and then I just burst into tears shock. Yeah, and she's like, okay. I'm going to give you meant and I called my mom and it's like very hard to say and very hard and then after that it's like I literally went straight from that appointment and I was in like Beverly Hills to it.  Ecologist she was like, here's an oncologist just go meet with them. And so I'm by myself like driving my mom's like I'll fly there right now and I'm like, you're in Texas. It would still take a while like take a breath. We'll figure it out, but it's even like that first oncologist. I had, you know, he's sending me to Cedars to get all this testing and you're getting every part of your body. Imma ride anything weird the biopsying so for me to answer your question after 2, Min and explanation, it was confusing.  Fusing because all you hear is breast cancer and then you start to think okay for me. I'm like, I'm going to find the positive stuff right away, but it was difficult because I kept the kept having to do different things. So it's like when you can be like, oh breast cancer is like the good cancer. Like it's the one most people are eating and it I feel totally fine. So I'm probably fine right like I don't feel any different. I just have this thing in my boob and it was weird because then there's a spot on my bones and they test that and that one I was put under it.  That was nice just the idea of having a thing in your bones. Yeah, freaky enough and that one came back negative. So they're like, okay there's this thing in your liver. It's probably like a hematoma like a blood clot or something. We're just going to take a sample that that was the worst biopsy because you're awake. Are you numb at all that one yet? You're numb from the waist are like from the top down like the under your boob down pretty much and it was like a team of people and they keep like sliding you and not of the scan and they're getting it out. So that one was at the freakiest for sure.  But then that came back positive and so I'm like what's going on here? Like how do I have stage four cancer? But because they had been like, oh, it's probably not going to come back positive. If your bones didn't it and say to the only stages of breast cancer is one through three or it's gone nowhere. It's just in your boob and maybe your lymph nodes if it goes anywhere else your stage for which that staging to Manila doesn't make a lot of sense. So for me, it was just in my liver, which is also weird like it's ship for my age young people when they get sick, it goes everywhere because we're healthy and  Cancer cells are just like we like here I go everywhere which is why kids it's awful and sad so for someone my age and to be because I was very healthy. Like I was exercising all the time. I love vegetables. I haven't eaten pork or read me and God knows how long I'm like a very I like being a healthy person. I'm a farm girl and so it was confusing. And so I my first doctor was like, oh we're going to treat you like you're stage two, even though you're stage four and I was like that doesn't make sense and he's like aggressive chemotherapy blah blah.  And then I go I was like, okay somehow I realized I needed to get a second opinion. I'm like thank God for TV. So I go get a second opinion. She's like I also don't know what to do with you. This doesn't make sense that your cancer is growing so slowly like you basically I'm being told by everyone. You should pretty much be dead. Like we don't know why you're here. Wait what? I'm sorry. I need to understand that. Yeah, like if you're younger and healthier the cancer spreads faster. You know what I think it is the may have you seen World War Z?  I have no idea what that is. So, okay. So similarly Brad Pitt. Yes me Brad Pitt. Yes. So all it's like it's like a virus. Yeah, and basically the virus just sucks on to anything healthy that they can get their hands on but the virus in World War Z avoids all the old people because they have nothing to live off of their debt life compared to World War Z before  Much better always always - yeah, so it's just like yeah, the fans ourselves latch onto anything healthy, they can live off of so like if cancer cell versus a regular cell like a regular cells always splitting and dividing a cancer cell does that at like twice the rate or even faster? So when your body is healthy that cell is in their thriving off of how healthy you are interest. That's why when kids get sick. It's usually like way worse. Yeah goes quick and when old people like you'll see  Grandparents get cancer and usually takes a lot longer for it to go anywhere or they don't go to the doctor for a long time because they've got a bunch of other health problems by the time they get there the doctors like oh you haven't noticed this for a few years like your whatever and of course it's not true for every case. But that's like the generals thing. So back to my original question. Yeah, if someone had diagnosed you at month one. Yeah, you wouldn't have been staged for possibly. Okay, so we don't really get the third and stage 4 is only because  He's out. Yeah, the cancers are not moved out of your breasts on area which your me again. It's just shit luck was in my liver. It turns out the liver is the most operable organ you have because it grows back its regenerative. So you can cut out. I think this add up to like 90 percent of your liver and it'll grow back maybe even more than that. I mean obviously that's a huge surgery mind. They only cut out like 10% and it's fine but it's the last doctor I went to was at City of Hope which is incredible hospital and Duarte and he was the first person to make me.  We understand the disease. He stole my doctor today spoiler. He's incredible. So you fell asleep already found the one. Oh, yeah, and he did. So the way he explained it to me was a stage four breast cancer, but the the term for the slow-growing is luminal B, which is just a term that no one else had told me so just means I basically got the cancer of a 70 year old woman. Wow, but there's also who knows why there's no Rhyme or Reason behind that. Yeah, which is weird. It's weird to like deal with that, dude.  Like survivor's guilt, which I think to also enter question from earlier is part of the reason why I always feel the need to speak up because I've met so many women who get the same disease who are also healthy young women and they don't do as well as me. So it's like for some reason I'm healthy and able to be responsive and do that and I know other women who aren't here anymore who I've met at the same time who had the same type of diseases me. So this shit is just all I mean, I hate to say luck, but whether  Are you live or die is luck. Yeah, which is crazy. I read the other day that they found this pill that could cure cancer. Yeah, so that's bullshit. There's a lot of those although I will say science has grown a lot since like are you know the cancer of our grandparents? Like I remember my grandma it was like everyone always got chemo. There's always chemo I didn't get chemo. So and it's not saying that that's an option for everybody but because  It was a slow growing cancer and I was prepared I'd cut my hair short like I could did it. All I had wigs already. I was like ready to get chemo and he's like, well, actually there's this new drug. Let's try it out given this new drug is kind of like birth control. Ironically. It controls your hormones the other way though. So for me, it was everything was really fed by estrogen. So they were like, we just need to shut off your ovaries like make it there needs to not be estrogen in your body because the estrogen is feeding the cancer.  So I would get this crazy shot, but the pill I take that I still take 421 pills without insurance cost $10,000. Well, you take that once a day. So it's three weeks on one week off kind of like breaking. I just thought about with insurance. It's around 200 and then California thankfully has a lot of great programs that are mostly temporary but they're usually flexible. Basically if you get sick young enough you'll be okay, but I'm like the age range of like 30 to 50 like the people who get sick then or even like 25.  Like this weird thing of like I don't feel like an adult yet, but I'm not a teenager. But like I'm also not and middle-aged person because when you think about breast cancer you think about like Mom's of course. Yeah, Grandma's and Mom's you don't think about your friends. Do you know the percentage of women in there? I guess under 30 that have gotten breast cancer day. It's it's very small and I think from metastatic especially like to be diagnosed right away with it.  It is like one in I don't know a lot right? It's like a 10 percent chance I think is what it was for mine specifically. Did your doctor ever talk to you about like diet and anything like that just because I hurt and I have had or at least reticent friends of friends who have gotten cancer and for gone instead of doing chemo did like a raw type of diet or something very specific for their type of cancer and had great results. Is that a thing?  Sure did that's a hard question because it's we definitely I personally I think there's a really good balance that you need both. You need eastern and western to balance each other, but I don't think that either one succeeds on its own fully because again, it's luck. So we're somebody else could have done a diet. You know, it's hard to say don't do chemo and do this if there's three doctors telling you to get chemo, right? Especially when you're the one who has to make the decision and a lot of times that can go wrong to where people for go well,  Eastern and try something and then it doesn't go right but it also goes wrong the other way around so I was raised by very liberal parents and Texas like my dad's big into like plant medicine and cannabis and all those kinds, you know everything and so for my doctor it was more about what supplements can help you avoid side effects. What can we do to give you the highest quality of life possible going forward because of your age? It's like what can we do and it's also all  That is like what do you want to try? Like, what do you what safe to try to yeah, because I had to oncologists again right before that. Tell me I needed to get really aggressive chemo and that was the only option and that but instead I did oral chemo and the first one just like made all my tumors stay the same size and then he's like, well, let's try a different one that one started to shrink them then they went in I got like five surgeries in a year and then I got radiation and then I've just been fine for like  Three years. I surgeries to remove the tumor. Yeah. So the first one was to remove the one of my liver which that doctor was the first one to really talk to me about diet, which was mostly about sugar and just about like balancing things about how things in excess are always bad moderation is the best for everything like yeah, eat pizza, but maybe a salad later or like, you know, if you're going to eat a whole pizza eat a big salad. Yeah. No, I like if you want any candy bar. Yeah exactly and for  It was you know, it's hard because if we knew what caused cancer we could answer any of these questions, but we don't so if we knew what caused it we could cure it. We know things that contribute to it or that can you know provoked it but even for me to tell you how I mean it's cancers just a bitch and general like you look at doctors can't figure it out animals get it kids get it like it's the ultimate equalizer because it's so confusing and  it's so unique for every single person and I think for me that was the biggest thing to learn was I was getting advice from everyone and I was in the craziest things I've ever had in my life like having like night terrors about my eyes bleeding and my bones disappearing and crazy stuff, but it's like people are telling you what they did when they had blood cancer or when their grandpa had kidney cancer and it's like that's a different type of cancer or even somebody else who had breast cancer could have had a non hormone positive.  A different type of it could have spread somewhere different than mine. So it's also like a pet. Each cancer is very very individual. I've so many questions, but if you have  It's called you're calling it breast cancer, but you also had cancer in your liver. So what makes it breast cancer because it originated there. Yeah, so I had breast cancer in my liver. Oh how weird I didn't know that either I used to hate science. And now I know so much science. I don't even know what my liver did what makes it breast cancer when it's in your liver. So wherever it starts that's like the personality of it pretty much so even the tumors in my boober and help it run had a  Current percentage of like estrogen and progesterone than the ones in my liver did so they they have like slightly different things about them, but they're the same type of cancer. So wherever it originated no matter where it goes, even if it had gone, you know, it's my bones that I have breast cancer in my bones not bone cancer. Okay, and then can you walk us through the surgeries and like how many tumors you had how the surgeries went? What was kind of like the Aftercare all of that? Yeah, so I mean  Again, I had an incredible doctor and an incredible team. Well, what made you go with what that doctor said somebody nurses specifically taught me the most through everything. They like told me to find support groups. They would tell me to go see different doctors. Like I was so in a weird cloud and like my mom had come up but she was so traumatized by it and like helpless which I didn't at the time understand very well. I was just like God she's just keeps crying at all these meetings like I need her to be  Helping me, but I was also like not crying and like sitting there like taking notes and being a Capricorn and be like what can I organize and I don't know it was just my first one called just I remember asking him about fertility stuff because a nurse of brought it up to me. She's like you should talk to somebody about freeze your eggs, and I asked him about it and he basically laughed at me and told me why would I worry about that when I had stage 4 cancer which turns out is illegal for them to do the laugh at you.  You well as any not talk to you about your Reproductive Rights if you have cancer because for him and I get like as a doctor. He didn't have the best bedside manner clearly and for him. It's like, oh I'm valuing your life over your fertility. Which okay me I'm not I'm thinking we're like I'm gonna need about both and it wasn't even like I was thinking I would definitely want to have kids. I was just like, oh crap all of a sudden this could go away. Yeah, and I didn't realize that so the next Doctor that I saw when I was like, okay, I'm going to see somebody else because the nurse was like  So you get lots of opinions and find somebody as a bedside manner that you can understand. She's like they don't have to have bedside manner but there's doctors that will that will sit there and help you understand and I was like, okay, I guess I could try to see somebody else and I thought I wanted a female doctor go to this female doctor. She gave me a crazier plan than the last guy and I was a night. She had a very thick accent which is not why I couldn't understand her. She also it was that on top of she said a lot of Science words and not a lot of like, yeah, here's how here's what the  This means yeah break it down into layman's terms. Yeah, so my last Saunders and yeah, my last doctor that I saw the last oncologist he recorded the entire thing. He's at him and his assistant. They're both explaining things to me. They leaving tons of time for questions were in like a conference room and not like a weird little office and I hadn't understood anything that was happening to me until I sat down with them and then all of a sudden I knew exactly what was going on. So, I think it's just instinct, which is very confusing when  You're trying to be like do I have the right instincts while I'm doing this thing that I know literally nothing about and everyone's like but it's up to you but it's up to you. So I was like, you know, I'm gonna go with the guy that's like it's up to you. But I'm also going to listen to you and help you understand absolutely and he looks just like Bernie Sanders that helps. Yeah. I've heard many times that when you need to seek advice for things that you don't necessarily understand to find someone that has the heart of a teacher.  I'll take the time to walk you through everything won't pressure. You will give you a pinions. Yeah, but mostly will like educate you and like in a way that you can understand and it was the hospital to because Cedars. Well, it's an incredible Hospital. They're busy isn't as fancy, you know, and it's like it wasn't easy to navigate the financial stuff. Like my parents aren't rich like there were rich in love, but it's the financial stuff is terrifying even though  Add people donating like crazy because again when you get sick young enough, you have more options than other people. Yeah, but the hospital itself like the minute I sat down I was assigned a social worker. They were like, we're out of your your network, but here's exactly how we're going to be in your network and they figured it all out before I even saw my doctor. Wow, one of the other hospitals did that that's awesome. So you had Insurance. Yeah when you went to them I didn't have insurance. I had my mom's insurance when I found the  Swamp knew I was going to lose it. And the first doctor I saw was like, oh it's from tissue get an ultrasound whenever so I had a bad insurance that I thought I'd gotten on my own those cheap and did nothing and then thankfully I got a good one right before I got the real diagnosis. It's a very confusing thing because it's all the mental health part of being diagnosed with cancer. I don't think his talked about enough because at the same time that you're making literally life or death decisions for yourself, like there's a reason that doctors can't  Do surgeries on their loved ones like because your mind is so clouded and you know, you're sitting there thinking about everything about you mortality. I had crazy survivor's guilt and I was in therapy I was in group therapy and I think the group therapy for me did the most and it was just people around my age who had different types of cancer who are at different places in diagnosis, and it was the best thing because it was the one room you could go to and feel like normal feel like you could talk about your problems without people being like,  Like, oh wow, like that's a lot. They can actually relate to you. Yeah, I had a friend take my best friend flew up and bless her heart. She tried so hard to like cheer me up and I didn't want to go anywhere and like do things and like be a human being I was like, I need to like shelter my itself and like do what I can every day because it's a lot every day and she took me to out in West Hollywood. It was like we're going to dance and it's going to be fun and I'm like, okay, obviously, I'm not really into drinking when I've just found out I have a tumor in my liver. I'm like, I don't know.  I can and can't do is like afraid of eating anything and we were standing at a bar and she went outside to smoke cigarette and I'm like, well, I don't really want to stand around people smoking cigarettes either. Absolutely. Yeah, and this guy is standing next to me this fabulous gay man, and he's like, oh so like making small talk. He's like, what do you do is like I do comedy and he's like, oh great like when's your next show is like, oh, I don't know. I'm like taking a break. He's like, oh you like trying to find yourself and I go oh, um, okay. Yeah. Sure. I guess that's it.  It he's like well, what are you doing? And I was like, oh, I don't know. I just got cancer. So like I just some taking a break and he just goes oh by literally walked away. He just he was like, I don't know you're so I don't know how to respond to that and just low end up standing at a bar alone. And I'm like, my boyfriend is having a good time not realizing that we've known each other for you know decade and this has always been a way of the way of fun. But instead it's like oh and so  To also watch everyone around you be helplessly trying to make you better when they there's nothing they can do there's a lot of mental stuff going on that people don't talk about in that isn't like provided to cancer patients right away and it's nurses shout out to nurses. I mean nurses are like God's gift to Earth as far as I'm concerned. It's so true. It's insane what can of like friends or family do like and ask that but what can they do? I know you're like there's nothing you can do.  But like, how can how can they be of support when they're in that situation? It's hard because I was for me the things that you would text book think are helpful aren't always like for example, when I was getting surgery as my mom would come up and cook for us and because of my boyfriend he can cook kind of now but couldn't then did save his life. Um, and so that was helpful that she was there to take care of me during the day while he was at work and then she'd go saying Airbnb at night.  But it really is I don't know the most helpful thing is just sending a nice card or like just bringing something over asking them. What you can do is almost the worst thing to do. I've heard that yeah. The best thing to do is show up. Yeah, bring him a blanket and like even like, you know, bring over some if you know, they're on a diet thing bring something, you know, they can have and but the other thing that would drive me crazy as if people were talking to my mom and not talking to me.  See how you can do that. Why is everyone talking about me back? So it's hard because you're not in a full mental state at the moment. Like you're kind of losing it keeping it together breaking down. So it was hard to know at which moment the right thing to do, but it's like if you know someone well enough if you don't know them very well leave them the fuck alone. If you do know them or like send them a nice card send him a gift card somewhere like Amazon right had a ton of stuff on Amazon just send him that but if they  They are your close friend just go over and just chill. You don't even necessarily have to do something, right? Yeah, it's like just remember that. They're the exact same person that they were before. They got diagnosed and they're transitioning and dealing with it. Just as much as everybody else is trying is confused and trying to figure it out. So it's what I hated was when people all of a sudden my friends are talking me and like a different pitch. Like, how are you might just talk to me? Like let's talk about something else like and of all tell you what I want to tell you.  Go like that's fine. But like I want to hear about your stupid date. Like I want to hear about like a weird like sex to get my mind off of it, whatever it is and just treat me like you did a like when it before. I was sick during this time. Did you find that some friendships got stronger While others kind of dissipated for sure or some people wanted to have stronger friendships are like come on and someone dies or when someone said it's like all of a sudden you guys were best friends.  Friends and you're like wait what that was what was funny to me? It was I was like damn I'm like popular all of a sudden had no ideas, like people from my high school and I was like, it's very sweet that they're doing this and I was you know, well-liked enough throughout my life, but it was very strange to just the some people great. And then there are people that just don't know what to do that are kind of like flopping around like a giant fish out of water in front of you and you're like, I can't tell you what to do. I'm sorry, and it's weird because no one knows what the right thing is and it  Again is so individual that it would just depend on what the person is going through. How much was raised on your GoFundMe the first time around it was like $40,000. Oh Hutch was insane and that is so unreal. It was enough to get me through a year of surgery and everything. We did a second one because it was my total treatment if we're counting. All the surgeries was like almost a year and a half that I was basically just in treatment how many surgeries I was.  Want to say five but I feel like I always say 5 and it's actually for so I had my eggs frozen then I had my liver surgery then I had my lumpectomy and they removed some lymph nodes and then I had a roofer ectomy which is what I had them take out my ovaries and I also had eight weeks of radiation. My biggest side effect of everything is menopause which ironically is like, what do you want periods or menopause like it's a it's a pretty flip either way.  In a pause right now. Yeah at 2029. I'm no I'm 30. Now. It's just getting a January 2038 forgetting that that's why not submitted menopause since I was probably oh my God, it's mine isn't that bad? So, I mean it's summer so sometimes I get if I get too hot then I'll have a hot flash on top of it the hot flashes for me are always random and usually in a funny time. Like I had a co-worker people like to tell me about when they know someone who has cancer and then  Fine always listen, sometimes I don't want to hear it but you always listen sometimes I'm like, this is really sad and like freaking me out but he's telling me about his mom is sick and I'm listening and I'm having the craziest hot flash ever. What does it feel when you have a hot flash because I feel like you sometimes and she's just like dripping. You're just beat completely fine and all of a sudden you're like, wow, it got really hot in here. Right and they're like God it is so hot in here and then you're just filled. What's what everywhere I was never I mean from Texas. There's a good amount of sweating that  Happens in Texas, but it's funny when it happens because you'll be inside like it could if it happened right now it which I could because wind sometimes I'll have a hot flash caffeine wine. It's like a chronic liar, right? Yeah, I'm would say she would like sweat through her she'd wake up and she'd be like sweat through the sheets and she's like it cold outside like there's night sweats to I don't get night sweats. I guess that's for me. Oh, yeah, sometimes I would wake up at the beginning and just be drenched and I'd be like, this is so  Unattractive and the other thing I had no idea about his what estrogen does to your body. So estrogen provides lubrication to your whole body. So it's like I get joint pain and then sometimes my vagina I'll be walking and I feel like they're just a wave of the desert has gone into there and I'm like, oh, it's so dry all of a sudden there. Okay? Yeah because I feel like there are things that give women in menopause more lubrication.  Drop there are most of them promote estrogen which is something I couldn't have for me. It's like there's like oils and stuff. You know, whatever. The other thing is Ben and it seems vain but it's my hair is thinned a lot. And at first it freaked me out and like I would like to see it coming out in the shower and I would struggle so much with even feeling bad about it. Because like I have my hair again survivor's guilt which is, you know, you think you're not sick enough to be sick, which is also an insane thing.  No one talks about so that was tough to but that's been something I've just been like. Oh great olaplex, like do something all of us save my life.  Well, I want to know how was your relationship with all this? How did your boy got that was my next because you're surprisingly estrogen. So yeah, I mean at first it was just confusing. We hadn't even been together for a year. We had just moved in together and I think for him I was very like, you know, the minute I got diagnosed. I was like you can go as like you can get out of this. It's okay. I get it. I was like, this is a lot, you know, you're he's two years older than me. So it was like, this is a lot to handle we're both.  Too young to have to go through this and even his mom was like in which I loved that she said this to be fair that I she was even like, you know, you need to think about it and be real with yourself because for him, I think he's such a nice person that he was very like well, it's the right thing to do right but was kind of afraid to say anything else and so me saying to him, you know, you can go really opened up to him being like, you know, I thought about it I thought about it and I almost did it but then I thought how would I feel?  Every day, he's like I would just be worried about you. Like I would just be wondering how you were. He's like, so all I can do is be here and he was really I know sounds my way right now. That's seriously shout out because I'm like feeling but it wasn't easy. I mean it was hard especially when I remember after my liver surgery and they had made I mean science is incredible. They made like five tiny cuts and like did it with the robot, but they pumped me full gas. So I had all this gas pain and I remembered  Trying to sit up the day after my surgery it stayed in the hospital for a night. My mom stayed there he'd been there for a while. And so I remember waking up in our bed and I had to pee so badly because I'd been on fluids and whatever and I couldn't sit up it was so painful because you wake up you've been on all these medicines and the doctor's office, but when you go to bed, obviously, there's like a good six eight hours, depending on how much you sleeping worried that medicine is, you know, even if you take one at night, it'll wear off. So I'm trying to sit up to pee and I  I couldn't sit up and I just remember not wanting to wake him up because I felt so embarrassed. I was like, I feel like a helpless old lady all of a sudden and then like 26 having this thought. Yeah. It was just sobbing and of course your wakes up because I'm crying. He's like what's wrong is like I can't take myself to pee but I mean, it's not the most attractive time of your life. We definitely were like, oh, yeah, we should go to some therapy because also the thing would be a lot of people don't talk about is when you turn off your hormones your kind of lose your sex drive like mine.  Comes and goes but it's like and you can't take a lot of the stuff that helps it because even Maka which I thought like, oh, I'll take this what it does. Is it promotes estrogen? So it's like I basically the way my body works is I can't have estrogen because now there's been there's cancer cells in there. They could still be in there somewhere and the minute they find that estrogen they're going to be like all delicious. Yeah, we're going to let's make a family, you know, they like a bunch of little. So how do you get around food?  And he just wait for the right moment and hope for the best actor. Does it affect your overall mood a lot not even just like sexual not like sexual wise but in general, yeah, I don't know. It's for me taught me so much that I have such a better perspective on life than I think ever had before and it really gave me like self-confidence finally because I finally I mean as women were constantly  Using our bodies like what we do. I remember being so worried about having red hair right before I got sick. I was like is this why I'm not booking commercials like because I have red hair as like I should be blond. I need to be blond, right and then just so I still have my hair. Yeah, and it was just an amine for it to happen. So young. It's crazy. And even I mean in life doesn't just stop because you get sick to it's not like shitty stuff stops happening to you. Like I had a friend passed away in a car accident like a year later like one of my best friends and that  To me was insane because she'd been so there for me through everything. It was so worried about me and she had no idea that she was going to be gone. And so it was crazy to me that I was I also felt equipped to deal with that in a weird way because of being sick or like the people expected me to be able to handle it and I weirdly could because I was like, okay, I know what it feels like to have extreme trauma and to be like how to how do we deal with this day by day? So it's like for sure mental wise I  Anxiety and depression still still but Depression known as much I mean I think mine was more situational in the moment anxiety for sure. I can't turn it off. I thought I had it before in life. Like I thought I'd had a panic attack and not had a panic attack like as no panic attack, like getting diagnosed with cancer 26 sitting in a car deciding whether or not you want to go film your friends sketch or if you want to go upstairs and lose your mind and  side of your own mind and it was for me comedy who did do that though. It was weirdly always there all my bad days. I had some weird comedy thing I had to go do and I knew every time is like if I just go do it, I don't have to tell anyone anything that's going on. I just go there and I do it and I leave so you found your Escape it helped me just get out of my head because my head became a terrible place to be and there's some inspirational quote. That's like be nice to yourself because like you have to live  Inside of yourself or whatever like you have to be there all the time like try to make it nice in your head and I always try to think about that but it's like it's hard to just turn that on and off of course. Yeah, and for me CBD especially has been very helpful with it because it's you know, not hurting my energy level at all, which also comes and goes depending like usually on my medicine the third week is what I'm the most fatigued and then the week I have off of it by the end of that week. I'm like, oh I feel so normal and then I'm like, I gotta start taking it again.  So it's all manageable and for me, it's all about perspective. It's me looking at people like I again not to be again. I lost another friend to cancer but this was a friend I'd made through cancer. And this was just recently and when we got diagnosed she was staged to so she was you know by all we were the same she was like I think 30 and I know she was 29, I think when she was diagnosed when I was 26, she was around 30. So just a couple years older than me very,  Cancers hers just kept going. She tried to take the same medicines as me didn't do anything. She went she would get chemo. It would work it come back at work it come back and then she ended up passing away from it. And it's like again survivor's guilt is a crazy thing not feeling sick enough as a crazy thing and I've learned a lot through diving into the diversity of it and like meeting in like the honesty of it because I feel like when something is different about you.  Or in seems dark or something. The best thing to do is to just be honest about it because it doesn't feel like you're hiding anything like when you're hiding what's important about you because it's scary. It's not going to help you grow and it's not going to help anybody else. Be more educated.  When you're going through that and you're in the intense stages of like whether you're having surgeries or you're just taking this medication, it's making me feel like shit or whatever it is. But then you still have to kind of go about like do you still go to work? And are you still going about your daily life or you like I have to take time off and if so then how do you pay for everything? Like it just seems so complicated. Yeah, I couldn't work at first I  And it wasn't even a first it was physically and then it was mentally it was like after getting through all the surgeries and being like Oh, I could because I was a waitress and I mean the restaurant I worked at they had been incredible like they had also done a fundraiser like they like named a drink after me for a month and like they were like, you can come back and do whatever you want here. Like will give you a job. No matter what it is. So but it took me a while to just like go back to a full-time schedule it because it's also this weird thing of like you  Get this time to focus on your health and your trying to have any sort of control and uncontrollable world with an uncontrollable disease. So I think it was for me hard to be like I'm going to go back and like be around normal people that know what's happening to me. It was much easier for me at first to like take random comedy classes where nobody would know who I was I could walk in and be like, we're all just a couple just some 20 year olds doing jokes instead of being like Oh, I'm gonna go like listen to  Podcasts that are difficult or like talk to people that are also going through it like I would avoid like I went from going headstrong into support groups to kind of avoiding it or like avoiding making new friends or if I made new friends, I wouldn't tell them anything. Yeah, and I think it was just deciding one day that I wanted to tell people and I told one of the comedy classes and they just did this they like made me this video and like did all this nice stuff. But again was a borderline like, oh it's almost  Too much attention, but it was a relief to me in a way to be like people will still love you even though you're different course and I think also in meeting more diverse people like people who like I went to a panel at UCB that was lesser-known diversities and it was like a girl who's in a wheelchair veteran who has PTSD and like it was missing an arm or like a guy whose Native American like all these things that you're like. Oh, yeah, these are things but  but to hear them talk after being sick to not realize what I was because I was like, well, I'm not disabled. I'm not technically chronically I was like, I don't really fit into I'm not even like a typical cancer patient. I was like, where do I fit and it was just figuring out that I don't have to fit in anywhere that I do have an invisible disability as what you could technically classified as but then it's like getting over the survivor's guilt and just accepting that this is who I am this  Is what's happened to me? I should just be happy and proud of who I am and honest because if we're not.  Honest about it then it's just the same ignorance of like everyone thinking of cancer as the same thing or you know, someone reading I had someone when I first got diagnosed asked me if I drank a lot of dairy and it was to me like I was like, whatever rude fucking thing to say to somebody who's like the first time I'd gone out. There we go. No, I was just trying to have dinner like have a nice dinner with my boyfriend and a couple friends and I see this girl and she's like, oh I heard about your getting sick. Let me ask you do you do eat a lot of dairy?  And like don't ask people that really yeah, that's what we're talking about. Right just went I guess so that was like literally I mean it wasn't my breasts. So like that just makes sense. Right? That's like people just that's just people trying to understand exactly like, how do I not get breast cancer kind of thing. Yeah, and it was that it's like meeting new women my age and being like hi. It's me your worst nightmare because they're all like wait, but you have a family history, right? I'm like no and they like but you like were like, I don't know like  Taking a lot of crazy pills or something or like just eating only McDonald's and it's like no like I know a vegan marathon runner who also had breast cancer like all these people I met I was like, oh, it just doesn't care. It literally can happen to anyone at any time. It's just like yeah, and I'm just a reminder of that. Hello mate. So well moving forward. What's like, what's the future? I mean, you're still taking this medication. What's the Outlook? What's your lifestyle like?  Name, I mean I pretty much changed my life completely after it because I was working in the office at the restaurant and I was like, this is fine, but I don't like just sitting behind a desk. Like I don't want to be behind a desk and I started walking dogs part time just because all I could think was what makes me the happiest. I've also since I got diagnosed got two cats and a dog. Let's just make your dog is so best medicine ever. I got two cats the my actually after my friend passed away. Then I got a dog. I was like, this is how I deal with drama judge and  milles us to works. Yeah. Yeah, but I I think I read like a Instagram posed by like humans of New York or something. That was his dog walker guy and it was like he had been working some job and was like, somebody was like just do something that'll make you happy and I was like, that's all I want to do it just like because you don't know how much time you have and even like don't to answer that question. It's like, I don't know like I asked my doctor Mike. How long do I have to be on this medicine there indefinitely and it's like that.  Nothing has to destroy you it's stuff is going to happen to everybody. It's how do you handle it? And how do you get past it? And so for me, it's been yeah, eat healthy, but don't drive myself insane. I've put myself on Plenty of crazy. I didn't have sugar for like six months and I was so skinny for like I was the skinnier than I've been in high school because I was dieting because I was like, I can't eat everything has cancer. Everything is bad and I was like, this isn't I'm not having fun, but I don't know. I still think that there's such a balance because you can  Obsess over being healthy and perfect your whole life and you can get hit by a bus or you know, so it's like if that makes you happy great if it makes you happy to eat ice cream eat ice cream. Just maybe don't eat a gallon of ice cream. Yeah, and that's like what my doctors have said to and I also have it's also there's things that science doesn't know yet and a lot of that is the diet stuff because you can't there aren't these perfectly planned out things because they are so busy trying to find what medicine could cure it that they don't there's  Are tons of Grants being put out for like is kale going to help cure this part of menopause like it's also a really hard thing to control in a test exactly which is another part of that. It's the same thing with with marijuana with cannabis is like, I remember when my grandmother was sick my parents trying to she was so nauseous from her chemo being like, you know, maybe you should try a little bit of this and she was just like no, of course, I wouldn't do that and it's like genuinely for me having that being in a state.  Eight like California where it's legal and easy to get that that helped me not take as many narcotics after surgeries because it's body, you know, it can help with body paint like all these things that are non-addictive like I hate taking. I don't know. I just don't like heavy painkiller drugs. Obviously you need them sometimes but I know I mean I've had family be affected by opioid crisis and friends and I know how addictive that stuff is one of the weirdest things I  Learned was that most breast cancer patients hate October you would think the opposite because it's Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Hey, it's just annoying that it's everywhere. But if you look at in the same thing happens with pride, I was just realizing to so many people like, oh we're going to sell your rainbow flag the benefits go to lgbtq. Like it goes to help people or its same thing with breast cancer and it's when you look at it. It's like one percent of the profits go and they're not pushing it really bad things about Susan G Komen. Well, I  I have actually worked with them a lot recently in the past year and I talked to the guy straight up one of the guys who works for Susan G Komen LA and I was like, why aren't you guys doing more for metastatic breast cancer? And he said I agree. He's like I think we should be doing a lot more and they actually are now doing more but there's still too much money being put into awareness. I'm doing quotations right and preventative stuff because how are you going to prevent breast cancer and like we're aware that breast cancer.  Snow. I mean I get point that like oh you need to be doing at home exams and things like that. But like, okay.  Now what yeah, everyone knows breast cancer is if anything one of the most well-known cancers, like that's the way it's one of the most common ones and it's usually moms that are getting it and of course everyone, you know, not everyone loves their mom, but hopefully a lot of people have great moms like me, but it's just I don't know it's there's no way to prevent it. That's all I've learned from meeting women who have it and for meeting all of all different ages and all different types of people that have you know,  For not the Necessities different family histories and meeting so many women my age who also didn't have a family history. It's just confusing because you're like Oh, I thought I could stop this like that's what I mean today up until you I thought that it was prevented of like there are things you can do to prevent breast cancer. You can do things to catch it earlier. But again, I felt it. I'm a responsible person. I didn't get a diagnosis for nine months. Yeah that had nothing to do with you. Why are doctors?  So dismissive to especially young women telling your story. I'm just realizing a lot of things that I did not know and I thought I knew about breast cancer. Yeah. So how do we change that narrative? I don't know because people are so afraid to learn I think about scary things. Yeah. We're so quick to learn which is weird because of how obsessed we are with murder as a society. Oh my God, I love and I do to Netflix series of murders are all right to murder podcast. Oh, yeah.  That's really the only one that I listen to so far. My sister is really obsessed with them. I love her and I also love like young adult sci-fi like all this stuff that doesn't matter because we want an escape and again, I love comedy because it's an Escape in a lot of ways, but I think it's it takes every person being willing to be uncomfortable if it's for the greater good. So learning about things like meeting people that are different and letting them tell a story instead of walking away from them because it's scary like that's what it takes.  Aches and it does it does suck though that and especially for women in this society that in order for us to help everybody else learn what we're going through we have to be so vulnerable and reliving our trauma over and over again and it sucks but it's like for someone like me it's like talking about cancer is easy because I'm okay. Yeah, right, but I also know that that's luck and I'm like and so I feel an obligation. So when I have someone like my friend Jenny had passed away.  A from cancer from the same cancer. I have we have the same doctor. It's like I have to speak for her. I have to speak for the people who are in the hospital who didn't respond to drugs. I have to say something because that's all I can. Do. You know. All I can do is be like, I have a story. It's a weird story. Will you listen to it? So it takes everybody to saying yes. I want to listen to it. I want to listen to things that are difficult and I want to learn about it. It's like global warming. It's  Confusing and difficult just listen just be willing to learn and be willing to say I don't understand that tell me more. What are your thoughts on the American Healthcare System is of crap as shit. Yeah, it's disgusting. It's disgraceful. It's awful. It's shameful. There's an it's so backwards and wrong. It makes me it's my number one issue as far as politics goes, of course personally.  Do you think universal healthcare is the answer? I think a Universal Health Care is necessary. We shouldn't I shouldn't have bad credit for the rest of my life because I went to college and got cancer and that's what I'm facing and it's not that I have a lot of unpaid cancer bills. It's that they were unpaid at some point or its and it wasn't because again we had money in it Go fund me. It's you're fighting for your life. You're not worrying about the bills, right? Why are they talking about surviving and  Next surgery. Why am I getting Bill some to collections in a month? You know, really? Yeah, and why is it so much money for life-saving medicines and life-saving procedures ever and it's so much work people don't understand how much work it is to be sick in the society for me that I applied for part-time disability when I was getting radiation because I was working then because your there's like a certain amount of time you have to wait after surgeries and stuff and I got denied the first time.  for just part-time state disability and applied for any other government assistance at all because we had again been very helped by people family friends and I was like, why am I getting denied and luckily had a social worker because I picked the right Hospital the third time and they were like, oh you have to apply twice because most people get denied the first time I'm like who would know that without someone telling them and how do you say I don't qualify for disability when I'm 27 probably the time I was applying for it, and I'm  Stage 4 breast cancer. What about that is not you know what? I mean? Like what I'm saying? That's doesn't make sense and people think that everyone's cheating the system of might you know, how much work it is to cheat the system and that's the people on top or cheating the system because they're the ones who can pay for it. But at the same time they can all get cancer. Their families can get cancer their children, you know, someone my age they've got daughters like where does where do we draw the line on who's good enough to get health care in this  Country like it doesn't make sense. No, it doesn't end just because because I got diagnosed at that time in my life. Like if Obama hadn't been the president. I might not have had Insurance because he had just lengthened that thing where you could have your parent's insurance to when you were 26. Yeah. I didn't know I was going to get sick. I had no idea just moved across the country. Like I was just trying to do what everybody else does and it's just shit luck. I don't know and seeing how expensive things are when they  Are out of your network, like knowing how I felt when I first got diagnosed and all the medical shit. I had to go through and knowing how expensive it was as it was going. If anything tripled my anxiety. I would have had a hundred percent in that so wrong like what are we doing to the mental health of people whose physical health is deteriorating and they can't do anything about it. Well and your mental health is directly, you know what I mean? Like the moment you get that intense anxiety. Yeah. It's definitely not helping.  Our physical health and no one's covering supplements. Like, you know, all the supplements you're buying out of pocket. So, I mean it's scary because the world's very expensive these days. I still pay a good amount for my premium. I mean luckily now, I reach my yearly maximum really quickly. I also had no idea what any of that meant when I got diagnosed I bear I don't really know my mom my parents didn't either they were like, oh like I've had to learn all of that and now like great I can help my friends with it now, but Lord, I hope I don't have to help them.  Through an intense illness with an even shittier Healthcare System. It's like we're safe and that's why to me all the stuff that's happening. Now that we're so focused on him like what a what a what about the people that are happening right now. Like what about every one that's dying right now that no one's like I can't move out of California because I'm afraid to live in Texas. Yeah, you know, and I love my family, but I wouldn't leave this state because of the state programs that I've been awarded because of the awarded as the wrong way.  That I've qualified for by being very early and because of the great hospitals out here and because of the amount of research that is done and because of the balance of eastern and western that is provided here. I'm not going to get that in a Southern state like Texas where they've shut down all the planned parenthood's how can a female with a female based health problem feel comfortable in this country?  You know, well just females in general. Oh, yeah comfortable and you know and especially like I can't have children and I can sit here and you know talk about how I think abortions are great. And it's like that used to be the thing of like the number one argument over when I was a kid growing up in a conservative, Texas down everyone being like what about the people who can't have babies and I'm like all of a sudden I am that person right and I still feel the same. Yeah, and I'm like and this is what we're talking about is abortions like oh  Like the planet is falling apart. Like everyone's got their mom's rule on abortion. Like really we're going backwards like no stop it. Yeah, stop it. Everyone should they everything in the world is unpredictable and so above us like we're so small as human beings. It's like the first time you feel an earthquake in California. You realize how small you are as oh my God. Yes. Yeah, you're like, oh the Earth could have just opened up and swallowed me. Yeah, and you're like great. I'm nothing and  it's like the quicker. We all realize that and just work to help each other like as a race and stop seeing your as humanity and stop being so worried about everyone being different. It's like we should be worried about like Health Care is a basic human, right? I studied abroad a couple times. So I have a lot of friends in European countries. They're appalled by the things I tell them I so I was in Greece a couple years ago and got really bad sick. I mean not compared to home what it's okay now.  No, I can't but I got really bad. And I know I've been more pathetic with the flu than I have been sitting there crying and I have a cold. I just feel like a total dick for thing that I don't know that comparison of my psychic twice. Some people get strep throat a lot and I'm one of those people and so when I get it, I know that I have it but it's gnarly like you have a fever you feel like shit. You can't swallow whatever so I'm in but I'm  Reese like with a girlfriend I'm like fuck I'm like so so I can't get out of the bed my fevers like super high.  And I end up go. I need like an emergency doctor like the way my insurance was transferring over. So they sent that to the hotel. They sent the doctor to the hotel. Wow. Number one. You're like, holy fuck. What is yeah, I'm like wait. This is going to be like I'm saying seven hours. Yeah scared. The guy comes in with his kit does the test?  Prescribes medication and supplements, he prescribes me like probiotics and enzymes and everything so that my stomach doesn't get all fucked up because I don't take antibiotics a lot of you know a lot and then he leaves and I owe him like $75 or something and I'm like, what the fuck like how did that just happen? Like I've been to the emergency room for UTI. And I think it was like, I mean, it was like hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of dollars.  Why is that? Why is it so different? It's like what it's like what is the cause of that great? It's money. It's a hundred percent of it. There's no other explanation because there's no Humanity in it. It has to be money how much money are the insurance companies making well in also like nobody understands it so that's a whole other thing is like if we don't understand it, we're smart women if we don't understand it if my insurance broker who for a living cells insurance doesn't understand it. There's something fucked up going on there.  The only difference is that America's you know, the land of really motherfucker greedy motherfuckers. Yeah, because they're taking a big cut. Like if the people in charge of the insurance companies are not doctors. Yeah, the doctors are so busy trying to save lives that they don't have time usually to understand Insurance either because they don't know why your insurance is denying it. So the fact that not only when you're faced with a crazy diagnosis like cancer or even a chronic illness  Anything even strep? It's like how are you? I won't straps actually a milder compared to some of them no offense because I'm like no strep sucks in his awful that stress mama know and I used to go every year but it's like when you're like facing life or death, let's say that way kid. Not only do you have to make the your own decision on what to do with your life in order to not die. You also have to figure out how to not be buried in debt forever. Yeah, and that's clarify countries in so much debt. I'm like I  went to college thinking that was a good choice knew I was going to have student loan debt had no idea that I would also get slammed with medical debt before I was 30 and I'm like just fucked but it's all so awful and it's hard to not be really angry about because I watch people get sick and die and their young women who deserve a chance at life and you know, and it's even I have a friend I met recently through a cancer thing who wrote a Facebook post about  Considering divorcing her husband because she doesn't want him to have her debt when she dies. Oh my God and for her to even be thinking about that, that's insane. And this is a common thing that happens and I had no idea people will get divorced when they have a terminally ill spouse so that the spouse doesn't have to live with their debt. So that goes with them. That's horrific. Yeah, and that's America like that's wrong. Like when did that happen, you know in our parents don't know like my parents are still shocked by all of it because I feel like it has all been.  Been kind of just growing and growing and growing and then there's getting our son worse. Yeah, and the wealth distribution isn't saying like I can imagine being an old person and not having a lot of money and Fiat knowing you're really sick and not knowing what to do about it and being like, you know, what I'd rather die than get the debt of being sick and I'm like, that's no one should like that's not America like that shouldn't be what it is. We're supposed to be this evolved nation and yet we just watch our citizens died and then  Our family deal with not only the grief of losing someone to a horrible disease, but the intense death they leave behind like why why do we need to have so much debt in our country? So when you want children you need to use a surrogate now. Yeah, basically it which of weirdly a like large amount of people have already offered which is the strangest thing for friends to do just all In come out of the woodwork and liked by the way if you ever need a surrogate I would do it. I'm like I got two sisters like it's cool. But yeah.  Yeah, basically that would be it. It's weird though to that whole thing. Everyone was so like all the nurses and the doctors. Like are you sure you want to take out your ovaries? Like are you sure about this like is are you? Okay? Like everyone was thinking I was going to be so traumatized by that by like the loss of my fertility, which if you had told me before I got sick. Hey in a few years you're going to you're not going to have kids. I would have been like, oh my God, that's the worst thing that could ever happen to me. I would have been devastated but in the  Like a fucking take my ovaries. I do not want them. I was like take it all I don't care and even I mean I do have a cousin who adopted a couple kids and like I learned a lot about the foster care system then and even since then this way before I was sick just knowing how corrupt the foster care system is and all of that. I was already like very like, you know, if I had kids I'd maybe have one kid to adopt a kid, but I don't know I feel like  I'm happy I have them there and it does give me the privilege to speak about it. Like I don't care but I when I look at it like right now maybe I'll change my mind in a few years who knows obviously perspectives change based on what you go through but for now, I'm like, I don't need it. If I really wanted to have a kid which at the time. I'm not too inclined for I'm very happy with my animals. Yeah, and my boy head it's just I don't know.  It's it's nice to have them there. But I pay for them every year it's expensive and they just sitting there forever. I think so, I hope so good question here to keep them there. It's 500 a year. Yeah, but if I don't tolerate yeah, you can only pay it all at once which sucks. I think if I could just pay it monthly it be but that initial that initial extraction was thirteen thirteen thousand dollars insurance won't cover it because fertility is a choice. Yeah, which is bullshit. That's not true.  True but when a doctor is saying to the insurance company, they're definitely going to lose their ability to have kids chemo kills. I think 80% of your viable eggs or something to like it might be less than that. I'm making its own. It's a ton of them it like when you get chemo as a young woman, they usually encourage you to freeze your eggs. Yeah, there's programs that help but who has time to apply for a program when they're saying? Okay, you need to decide by tomorrow whether or not you want to do this because you have to do it right now so you can go into treatment right after.  They even told me this programs you can apply for it's going to take too long for you to get an answer so you can either do it or not. I've looked into freezing my eggs. Have you? Yeah, just like briefly because you know where 32, right so you always hear like, oh no like it's time. I love having my biological clock. All right, so it's nice but and you everyone's like, I mean, I don't even envision myself having kids till at least I'm 35. Yeah, so it's like do I just wait and see how my body is or do I?  Tech to the chances of not being able to have a kid if I choose to have kids later in life. Oh, yeah, and I even there was a point where my boyfriend broke up with me after I'd been sick and we've been through a lot and it was around the first time I'd been well and we've been fighting a lot about stupid stuff. We've been together for three years of the time neither one of us have been in a relationship that long and that was to me the only time I cared about having them weirdly because when I thought and it was just a month of like, but I was so destroyed.  Buy it because he had broken up with me was like, you know, I don't know what's going on. I don't think I'm in love with you and it was to me immediately all these fears. I didn't realize I had of like who's going to love me if I'm sick who's going to love me if I'm infertile like all the stuff. I never thought about that I had to deal with in that month that I thought I had dealt with you know, but then it's like once it's there and it's happening. That's why I'm like since I have the Frozen egg sure I can talk about wanting to adopt whatever if I didn't have them. Maybe I have a different perspective.  Right. Yeah, that's a good point. Yeah, so have the option. Well, how did you guys get back together then? Oh, he realized he made a horrible mistake because I'm amazing, right? Yeah. Now we both kind of like went off and like tried to date other people. I couldn't do it at all. I was to still in love with him and also still in our apartment like with our pets and stuff and he was like saying with the friend and I think for him it was he was seeing another girl who did seem to really like him right away damn guys, so  See to date I know but for some reason I don't know. It's like going like that can't you miss me like that? Yeah, I'm like going back to Annex and he's like meeting new people immediately who are like so into him. Like, how are you even capable? Yeah, I think rabbit was partially fear of like that wanting to be free for a minute and I think for me too, I wanted that and didn't realize it of like, especially when you go through so much so young so quickly and your first serious relationship, I think for both of us. It was like we probably  About a healthier discussion about maybe taking a break instead of him just be like I can't do it. I got it. Uh, but you know that aren't the smartest beast in the world, but I think for him it was he realized that he did love me and that love is very complicated and changes what the definition of it is as you go along and for him it was if even if it's not the life I imagined the life I want to have is the life I have with you even if it's not the cookie cutter image of what life should be. I made him earn his way back.  Though. Oh so good. That is that was like well now you have to prove it to me, but I was 40 you gonna do but you're like you're like in the background like it's like, oh thank God. I don't have to lay in my bed and eat a whole pizza by myself anymore watching robot with also a large salad. Yes also with a salad of a pizza covered and vegetables on his fine. Well dress and food. This was like really  Mind blowing. I think this is one of my favorite episode. I don't want to call it an interview because like this really interview. We just talk but I think the good of my favorite conversation so far. Yeah. Hey, thank you guys for being willing to have a conversation and for not shying away from difficult questions because I feel like people do that a lot. They're afraid they're going to offend me or something because it's always confusing of like if something bad's happened you everyone wants to know all the bad stuff because that's for you know, it's our morbid curiosity. It's okay, it's human.  But it's like also asked about the other stuff. Like if you're going to ask about the stuff that you want to go and tell your friend to have a cool story later. Like also get to know the person that's there totally because it's like there's you know, a girl who's a incredible actress and comedian who just happens to be in a wheelchair. It's like that's just a part of her but it doesn't mean that she isn't still this incredible young woman or it's like for me I shouldn't feel lesser than my peers because I have an illness, you know, and it's also I have a bunch of friends who  Chronic illnesses who I relate to so much who also went through the same diagnosis problems America get it together go figure and it's just you know, I feel like we all have to they always feel more comfortable being honest with me and I like that somehow me getting sick as created an air of people wanting to be honest with me and wanting to have difficult conversations with me. I feel like once you I'm going through this with student loan. I've been going very very vocal about my student loan debt and I  feel like once you own up to something that you once felt ashamed of or embarrassed of you are surprised about how many people just needed someone to step up so they could talk to you and feel good about not so good but like feel comfortable about their situation and so it's like just being willing to be honest and be like, yeah, it's really messy to be a human being like it's messy and it's complicated and we all make stupid.  Awful mistakes, but if we just continue to present like I am perfect. I'm always wearing makeup. Like my abs are always great. You know, it's like all this stuff of like I just drink this tea and that's why I'm skinny, like none of that helps anybody like what helps is being like I'm happy and functional and I'm also fucked up like just because I can walk around with a smile and look like a normal person doesn't mean I'm not dealing with a lot like just me knowing that about myself. I know that everybody else kind of  As that and it just giving people the opportunity to you know, be flawed. Obviously if you're just consistently taking advantage of people and not trying to be a better person that's on you. But the one thing I've really learned is that happiness is so active and takes so much work and that's what people don't think about. We think it's just easy to be happy. It's easy to be sad. Well because we're constantly seeing on social media and in the media period just people running around island hopping  And where I have the perfect clothes and they look so happy with their boyfriend doing this and it's like let's be honest. What else is that? I also think where is the credit card debt? Yeah, we're older so we kind of know like it's like what the real situation? Yeah, we know that that's only part of the story. Yeah, exactly and it's all again perspective. But I do worry about like my teenage cousin coming up and what she sees and I'm always just like and it's hard even even as honest as I  I am right now when I'm posting stuff on Instagram, I don't always want to be like, oh today I was worried about dying or like today. I thought about my mortality, but until know how many people would support you if you did what I always do and that's the thing every time I do choose to just be honest. Like if I have I get three months cans or I'm in the hospital all day. It's boring whatever and I always try to share what I'm at the hospital's people see how often I do have to go to the hospital just as maintenance or like how the hospital can be fun which isn't the sort.  For sentence, I'm like but it can be like people are when it's there when you go to the hospital to make sure you're still okay, like I'm always fine, but I still have terrible anxiety before scans because I'm like what if this is the day like a twisted my foot walking a dog and they're like you foot looks weird. We're going to do an x-ray and even knowing I twisted my foot. I'm like it's I'm gonna have cancer in my foot and I'm gonna die tomorrow. It's all going to suck and it's like again. Yeah, it's just but it's also people shouldn't have to consistently relive their trauma to teach people.  Oh, so it's like man, it would be great if we had a you know better access to mental health that everybody did I do as a cancer patient because I had to get into this shitty Club first were then people want to give you stuff for whatever reason they like. Let me do free acupuncture. Let me do Reiki like I've done everything that you can think of I was like something's going to hit right one of these things must be working. You got free Reiki. I got free Ricky thing. I know I keep I've been wanting to do Reiki man. I know it's I don't know what  Does but it always was nice. I actually have a girl that does Reiki she's coming in. It seems I would love to know more about it because I don't know what they're doing. But every time I'd leave and be like I feel like a complete human for some reason like just that every part of me is even all of a sudden. Yeah, but yeah, it's just whatever you can do and I think to the best some of the best advice I've gotten is that you know, we can't change the past. We can't predict the future if we don't appreciate the time we have for what it is.  Then you know we're either going to die with regret or live with regret. Yeah, we only have this moment. Yeah, that's why they call it the present any thank you so much wear it because you do what's it called use a coil improv musical. I know I know it sounds crazy and working to find out like not enough. How can I scare myself even right. I can follow me on Instagram which again sometimes I do Post fun cancer stuff and sometimes I pose a lot of photos of my dog.

Everything you thought you knew about cancer was wrong.  Fuck.   Annie Bond is on our show today, a talented comedian (and dog owner) who was diagnosed with Stage 4 breast cancer at 26.  Apparently you can do everything right and still get breast cancer?!  Annie talks about navigating the American healthcare system (surprise, it's impossible), dealing with the loss of friends and how a look-a-like Bernie Sanders helped saved her life. 
spotify:episode:5Wo2IkZg29HHUJNSN2SMZD	Hello. Into the Royal brand-new sfc podcast brought to you by the something that your team. This is episode 7, which have been a here and I'm joined the University of Southern Belles Chief songwriter Phil Smith, Monica. Sorry mother. Yeah plus Mark Donnelly morning. James is back on next week as ever plenty to discuss since I last podcast something would be nothing standing 3-1 away drawn and help Northern United in a frustrating night for all concerned plus of course, the Takeover is imminent indeed. Perhaps by the time you listen.  This it might have already been done. We live in Hope big Sam has been linked with a return one day over the weekend details of the new Netflix series have been revealed plus we'll have all the build-up to the weekend trip to bottom Wanderers as well so as ever plenty to to get through. So let's get cracking. We obviously talked in depth last week about the Takeover of things. I guess moved hugely since then in terms of announcements. Has it Phil but we expect news imminently. Hopefully it seems yeah.  You know as we said on here a lot, it's not always particularly useful is sort of going timescales because these things change its as we've explained a lot. It's relying on a lot of different people. A lot of people who aren't necessarily directly connected to the to the people who were buying the club or selling parts of global whatever Network people who have to do their jobs and do their bit so you can never be entirely sure my understanding for what it's worth and if people are interested is that as  As of as of yesterday, I was given an indication certainly my understanding was that there's some hope that it could be Monday There's was the day that this is gets signed sealed and delivered or what have you but like I say that it wouldn't take an awful lot to move that back. It wouldn't take an awful lot to move that forward. So I wouldn't get too hung up on that book what that what we can certainly say. Is this is this is now a very very close to being a done deal and Mark you got a Bittersweet including speaking to  Journalists Over America from the Miami Marlins who the three prospective new owners have a swimming involvement in what what kind of things did you learn from him? And although it's not to say that necessarily Advocate that someone and I guess even indication of the kind of things they perhaps do I look to try and do yeah. It's interesting because I think a lot of parallels can probably be drawn between the situation Miami were in when that group took a you know, what is a small share about 7% in there in the baseball team to wear Sunland are now and the key thing they've done is try and make things a stain.  Will they put a lot of money into their Academy? They've launched an academy in the Dominican Republic which is quite an interesting concept but something they want to try they've invested heavily in a fun experience, which I know something Tony Davison's previously can it is something that the ownership change could allow someone to maybe do a little bit more they've reduced ticket prices. They've improved their concessions. They've made standing only areas and you know that that you say there's no guarantee. They're going to do those things at Sunderland and they are a small part of what's happening at at Miami.  Because it's you know, a big big ownership group that is in control. They're just as a comparison, you know, they invested about 85 million dollars and the whole take out whole takeover was over a billion dollars in total. So it's not all down to them. But it's a lot of positive signs a lot of things. I think some than fans. I'll be quite happy to hear if they are indeed replicated when they eventually get announced here on where side so yeah, I mean obviously when the tickles announce we'll do a takeover special. So we'll move on for now. There's not much to say really until it's done basically.  Accrington Stanley summoned fell behind it for five minutes bounce back very quickly Linda Gooch going a brilliant volley two minutes later and then by halftime they were there are 3-1 up.  Yet there's still quite a lot. Chris isn't wasn't a despite the fact that someone won 3-1 away from home. I think most ones would usually take that as a no a result. Perhaps some funds not happy that they didn't go and put four or five past acronym of the failed yet again to keep it clean sheet filcher. What was your take on that ground game and the resultant performance? I think it was.  I mean, it's a difficult issue. It's a complex issue. I think that  You know, we've probably probably reached a point I think a little bit where I don't want say the novelty of League one, but there's there's no doubt that I think everyone would say that it's feels a little bit less fun this season. That's not a not a criticism of anybody. I think it's perfectly understandable that last year there was that sense of adventure extensive freshness New Beginnings that probably allowed the probably put a different slant on on the me the matches the the quality of football in some games and what  View and and that's probably not there this season because of the kind of the heard of Wembley the disappointment of having to sort of come back for another year and leave one and and I think that's still there a little bit I would never criticize anybody for that because we don't want be covering some of them. They won. We want to be covering some the championship some in the Premier League You Know Jack Ross wants to be managing summoned in the championship in the Premier League The Players won't be playing for Sunderland and in the championship. So it's there's that are of that are of pressure.  Assure them that yeah, there was pressure last year, but it is just a different vibe and this year and that puts a different slant on analysis because if people see things in games that they think raises concerns about the possibility of going up the season then it's going to be it's going to be heightened. It's going to draw actually criticism this year because nobody wants it a third year in this division. So I think that's probably where that frustration comes from that someone didn't go out and turn it into a five.  We know whatever and then it just comes down you're being on football because some people will believe a lot in momentum in making a statement send the message out that kind of thing personally personally. I don't Peterborough, you know in my eyes if that was true Peterborough when they went to New Look which I met Ivan 160 over the weekend with a chummy with the Falls of the didn't came back and won drunk came and Drew 2-2, so I don't worry too much about that. But I think the context for that kind of environment is people just this desperation.  To not be in Li one next year is unfortunately going to draw and an intense scrutiny on on any part of someone's game and performances that suggest that they might they might not get in the top two. So I think that's probably where it comes from and it it is difficult when you know, three one win away from home and three fantastic goals, you know, it's tough if you're in a position as a club while that doesn't feel like a fantastic day out. Yeah, but that's just unfortunately that's just kind of probably the reality of weather.  It's funny because I was here obviously in the office at they working and I drank it just everything was okay before we left and you were like was lots of criticism. There's a criticism on Twitter. I was like what really it just won 3-1 away from home. I couldn't quite father meant but he hosts which is life at the minute Ross then did his press conference on Monday at the Academy a light head of the rather than game on Tuesday night and say it was a bit feisty lot of passion which I guess was good to see a took umbrage, I think.  At the the way the question was posed that weekend. It was a good result but a pool performance and he hit that quite strongly jet Ross probably one of the first times I've seen him seem do that gave a defensive aside and said that's too much negativity around each sort of results and then it kind of time sort of hold the club back. It was really interesting comments what we are take on it Mark Festival. I think as you say it was quite good to see because he is quite quite not laid back, but he's quite measured in what you said. You never gets too high never gets too low.  I think Stephen Elliott the former sudden strike alluded to on Twitter. It was good to see that fire in him that that desire that he does want to do. Well, you know, he wants to push the club on and I do think he's got a valid point that as Phil says, you know, everything this season is going to be kind of intensely critiqued. Everything's going to be looked at in detail because they need to go out a ligue 1. There's no question about it. They need to get promoted the season. Well, you know a 3-1 win away from home against a current in the team that you know this time last week. We were sat here saying would would post some form of threat to  As they always have because they do like to play football. You know, they've got a crack in Pitch now home since the work they've done over the summer and you know, they want to play football. They want to get at teams. They were always going to pose a threat and I think a 3-1 away win is nothing to be nothing to be complained about whether aspects of the performance that could be improved of course, but, you know not playing it a hundred percent and still managing to score three goals and win away from home is what promotion winning teams do and that's what's on them will need to do and keep  doing you know, when the having those off days keep grinding out winds keep grounding out results, you know, not necessarily saying they grow at the grounded out at akwonton because it was in the end quite comfortable but winning when you're playing badly is not necessarily a bad thing and it was actually the other effect is a lot of funds and I guess agreed with the stancy taken it and what Jack Ross is saying that of course, I'm maybe put a bit by added pressure on your head of the choosing a game which obviously then ended in a 1-1 draw at home rather than bringing start through magma Nutley after Alamos.  Mistakes passwords you make that possible.  Just a lame doing a lame thing. No surprise to me brilliant touch with McNulty sort of the keeper then slaughtered home. And then of course in McGee D penalty, which was saved in that I guess was the turning point because from then on rather than who were quite impressive for back well, and we're fully deserving of a point in the end and sometimes out of the chances Charlie wake 101 which was saved and I think the gauges or denied an effort before the penalty in the first half and so yet another one. I'll draw some booze at the final whistle.  I guess through frustration more than anything. But again then a bit more fun reaction against John Ross and you just kind of get in this cycle then. What did you make of the Robin game filling the performance?  Pretty disappointing in the end and I think the first first half an hour was very very good at thought rather imposed bit of a threat on the counter, but primarily that was just a consequence of how son did set up and the way they were playing, you know jarrod's it moved a little nine further forward. It was a very specific game plan. We saw that from us to take in the first minute was to get the ball early either in the McGee's feet or over the top for McNulty the chase but they just looked at it. They understood the players seem to understand the game plan there.  He bought into it doesn't have a lot of trust in it and it was really good to see it was a you know, rather Romero good side. I've read some things and heard some comments about them being mediocre or average. I think we need to get away from that personally. I think rather armor, it would decent side. They were unlucky not steal bless you or anyone who watch them and tell you to my eyes quite Robertson's a good place and then try to sign them last summer for a little DARPA was a good sent forward. Jake has his good place though to go out and do that in the first half.  Always first half and I was very encouraging the game turns when you miss a penalty because that's a chance to I think it's very tough to see rather than coming back from that. If you don't turn that spell of dominance into a two or lead in my opinion rather than my good side and they're going to come back and have some saying that's what they did.  I don't think someone's response. That was pretty great. I thought they lost a lot of composure a lot of control. I don't think they handled the last half an hour very, well. You could argue that Charlie why you should score which of course he should have done and little nitrogen better when he got free in the final minute, but I don't think I think especially at home in the stadium. I like you your objective has to be to get hold the ball for a longer period to in my opinion. Anyway build a bit of sustained pressure pain rather. I'm in a little bit get the crowd behind you mate rather and feel like they're under a lot of  Russia I thought the game was too often. You always want something to go for it, but I thought maybe the went too far the other way. I lost a bit of shit possibly composure and maybe the frustration steeped into the players a little bit and I think they're going to have to handle that better this season particularly home because there will be times where they're going to go in the last 20 minutes kneading they're needing a goal and I think they'll have to handle that a little bit a little while a lot better to be honest. Having said that  In McGhehey doesn't miss penalties. So you have to put it in the context that they put themselves in a great position to go to nil up. And at that point you have to think they would have gone and secured a really really good and convincing homeless play. So as you would say about any game still quite early in the season, you don't take two big conclusions from it. You don't go too far. Either way on it. There's some really good signs some really really good signs and some concern and Science and I guess until we've played another six seven games at home. We probably won't be able to draw it a proper.  Collision where there are in that sense so some you know, we shouldn't get too lost in forget too much about the good signs and but definitely definitely some big things for jacking the place to ponder as well. I was at was impressed with other rooms are relentlessness at the end of we're still pushing for three or four of them later on in the game. Obviously, there are good sides when there are good side and you know, I would always  I've I would never criticize anyone for saying that something should go and do really well in this league and be at the top and go and try and win the league completely agree with it, and I don't mind that at all. Sometimes I think.  For whatever reason maybe we don't discuss or analyze or make judgments on the opposition as much as we would in the championship in the Premier League for understandable reasons, but I don't think anyone could look at what rather have done over the last couple years the players. I didn't the team and expect them not to do something and I'm in a game against the Sunland team. That is very good League one side, but it's not so exceptional so heavily funded that it's going to play against a team like that and  Completely dominate for 90 minutes the issue for someone to course and where it's fair to kind of criticizing the right word. But question is they didn't make the most of the dominance Bell when they were really really really really good and of consider another relatively soft goal so that I think you have to you have to balance those things out and their managers bit. The character is me is any Market plenty is a post-match. Yeah. It was a bit of a surprising press conference at as someone who's never really seen Paul warned speak. He was he was quite humorous. He was quite  Honest, I think in his verdict that is Side Road. They look a little bit during that kind of first 25 minutes half hour spell wear something where were completely on top, but he's obviously created quite a happy camper and it's easy to see why if he's if he's leading it. He's quite a character. He's quite upbeat, you know with as he said, you know, he's essentially overseeing to relegations that rather than easy still be a nice little still been kept in the job. So he's obviously got something about him and as Phil said, you know, they've built a very very good squad. They've got some really good players there. They've used alone Market well,  I said call the Morrison their Daniel leaves and the keeper look like good players both of whom were in alone. And I think they will be be there or thereabouts the end of the season and you know, Paul warns to the relatively young manager and you could be could well be in for bigger things in the future just go about the weekend after the acronym game with a few hours after that big sound was linked with a possible return to summon one day so that he's opened. Well, there was actually direct codes but the piece itself so that he was open to return the management and that  You'll be able to return the cylinder some some point in the future. Obviously Jairus in charge at minute. Would you welcome a big some returning at some point? I just think that's just it certainly likes to spend money. Not lose more than the Premier League. It's a different kettle of fish cylinder league-wide. Yeah, I look at  Big Sam did let some fantastic memories here at Sunland. He'll always be fondly remembered for the last few weeks that season and rightly. So it was one of the best times I've had in recent years think he left a good time. Yeah, because it allowed him to not have to worry about a legacy especially the fact that you went to the England job, you know, nobody can say for certain how it would have spun on, you know, what would have happened if he'd stayed for a longer period I'm sure results would have been fine.  It's and then just all comes down to opinion and you know, I had my opinion if you look big some screwy tends not to leave you might live clubs in a better position in the table and Mary found them but you generally doesn't in my opinion leave grid structures in place. Yeah, but that's you know, that's kind of just my personal opinion big salmon other people will disagree and I've no issue with that. And certainly you left some happy memories here, but more generally I think it's something that this is going to be the biggest test for me for the new owners because everybody knows that you've got a lot of money that you got a lot of access  Capital and that means you can get an awful lot of people in the game who want to get on that bandwagon who want their get on the gravy train. If you like. It's gonna be a lot of people sniffing around Sunland agents managers people want and director of football rules. All that kind of thing. Some people might be hugely talented and doing it for the right reasons and worth talking to worth listening to as an awful lot who want and we saw that in the yellow short and the other short either there was a lot of people who  Got a lot got a lot out the club. Let's put it that way and I'm not sure they put an awful lot back in. It's one of the reasons why I think it's probably wise to have Stewart and Charlie staying on the club because they have that experience that they have in football will be important because that judgment I think will be will be crucial and you know, I the fact that it's big Sam I think distorts the story a little bit because he's someone who rightly fans are very very happy memories of but this is going to be a big test for the new ownership because going to be no shortage of people  It known an inverted comments that they'd be interested in getting involved with some and then the reality is is where weather where there's a lot of money and I'm not referring big Sammy. I'm just talking more generally you can draw characters who might not be in it for the for the right reasons. So it's going to be a big test when if and when this takeover also, yes indeed as we were obviously report this week, John Ross has a job as a certainly safe anyway, but I guess it'll be result dependent as every manager in the league faces that same for it.  So we shall see right moving on then Lynch and debauch the pair of them played against Middlesbrough under-23 that happen on Monday evening Phil was there what did you make the other pair just briefly fill tube octoly debauch got the full 90 didn't England. I got the whole nine yard. Yeah. It was it's always a difficult difficult recessed plays in this in 123's games because it's quite a strange environment for them to play in.  Lynch looked pretty good in the are very vocal looked fine. Something didn't defend tickly. Well to be honest. They were if you very poor Puli lid offside trap Sagat capitalized on but you can't draw that into that much because you know, Jordan just playing alongside Brandon Taylor who probably spoken to at length of the for the first time the dressing room before the game. So if the communication and the understands a bit off you shouldn't draw too much into that, but he went off after an hour. We'll find out later today whether that was anything serious or whether it was just a little little  Caution certainly didn't felt was a precaution the bark. I was really impressed with you looked you look to Cut Above. He looks like you really shouldn't be playing in the game can stroll through it a little bit when all these challenges decision making they just look pretty straightforward for I mean, I've looked particular tested. So so that was encouraging the course will be very different when he goes away to you your acronyms and balls fizzing around is a years and subtype pitch and he's got forming on the extractor smashing in women all that kind of stuff. So  so I wouldn't get too carried away. But certainly it was the pretty encouraged and start from you. Look fit enough and I say you look way too good for that level which is I guess a promising sign good stuff. And as Phil says he'll get updates from Jack Ross afternoon. We were recording this at the University of Sunderland on Thursday morning with myself, Rich minute Mark Donnelly and Phil news. I was gonna say news emerged of and I put it was a lecture wasn't it here at the University about the newer Netflix series Mark and  Some of the details that have come out ahead of head of that which we expect. I think they'll be February time series to have Sun until I die. What what did you glean from some of the details? Yeah. Well, he said he Leo / when the producer said he expects February, but I think they're kind of at the whims of Netflix's to their schedule of releasing shows and they can quickly change that it short notice so it could be brought forward. It could be pushed back. What come first to take over our city which to some until I die. Well, hopefully this thing over hopefully you take over and put no, I mean, I think I'll be really really  Interesting watch in terms of you know, there was a lot going on behind the scenes over the ticket over last summer. Now. We see kind of the jet Rodwell puppy unibody did un dong. Yes Agha slimy at seems years ago. Suddenly. There's an Ethics how hard to remember that was just just over 12 months ago, but she then the Josh magic contract situation as well be interesting to see will Grigg deadline day and they'll be fascinating to see how that I'm at the club. Yeah, you know, I know Leo Pearlman said the the scenes and the shots he thought with a bet  To a the ones in Trafalgar Square before the checkatrade trophy final which kind of gets its own episode. I think episode for the series is going to be dedicated to the the checkatrade trophy run. So it should be really interesting to watch you know to do with Donald. I'm sure will be open as ever in it. And yeah they fail to refuse fell to rule out sorrier a third season which would be be very interesting particularly. If obviously when this takeover does get announced to copy very very interesting and it's six episodes, isn't it? Rather nice? Yes, it's rather than 8 so a little bit little bit short of this time. I think the last stair  The series was kind of 35 45 minute episodes. There's no indication as to what this season will be. But yeah, six episodes instead of eight five of which are focusing on the league campaign under the ownership of the club and the fans and then episode 4, as I said focusing purely on their the checkatrade trophy run in that first trip to Wembley called stuff. So we'll fought like a mouse right? Let's move on to some really questions about an absolute boat loading this week, which is good to see thank you all for your questions and Davey be from South Shields. He's been supporting the culprit.  He has and Debbie asks, why did McGee take the ball from Gooch and then blow the penalty surely we have a designated. Take care. And if so, who is it Gooch has taken them with a plum in the past. There isn't a dozen apparently. No, there's nothing to whoever grabs the ball. Yes. No, it's Jack Russells belief that just leave it the place to start on the pitch. Whoever whoever ends up with the ball. And with the ball on the spot is the one who should is the best person to take it. I think it's one of those things that it's funny something because you really you are for  all players who would be first choice of pretty much any club in Grant Linden Aid and then we'll Greg. Yeah and it is Harsh on Linden because he's genuinely brilliant penalty taker is very unlucky not to be the designated pilot jet. What I would say is that in had a method that was very very successful from last season just because he's missed this one, you know, you can't yeah, you can't have a revisionism and say them again. He's not good at in penalties last season didn't get you did was absolutely terrific it in penalties he has  He's always done that little thing ain't which worked very very well from last year. You do wonder whether goalkeepers will eventually cotton on to that. So I don't know whether the other night was because either some knew what he was going to do in was prepared for it or whether McGee just didn't execute what he normally does. Well enough. Yeah. It's impossible to answer that. But no, I mean, you know, it's a valid debate whether you should have designated palmitate with stressors believe that you shouldn't so there isn't one. But you know, if he hadn't stepped up to the next one, I would back him to score frankly having said that link  A judge can consider himself very unlucky. Yeah, he's a he's a he's a tremendous palette and we saw that on the opening day of the Season didn't we he's really really in fact, but sometimes that's just how it goes. I remember the season the Premier League when someone got relegated and Jermain Defoe was the was the penalty Taker and there was a couple of unsavory scenes where farini tracked hit the ball off and got a bit of stick for it. But brainy was the best pilot I ever seen Sunland so you should have been taking them out of the four but to for rarely missed because he had that confidence. There's no there's no exact science.  Definitely think you can consider himself and Fortune, but I wouldn't personally I don't I wouldn't overthink it just because I say the next time if the balls in the game these hands I'll have no problems with that out back into school. It's innocent other no designated because then on the field it can not that it did on Tuesday, but it can sometimes lead to what looks like one Savory kind of between the players and I mean whether almost grappling for the ball and stuff and interesting, right Kyle Stewart, this actually ties in with the Netflix. We just mentioned a couple minutes ago from home.  Mouth supported the club for 42 years interesting read about Copenhagen and other Danish clubs. Try changing season tickets to a Netflix style monthly subscription service. Just wonder where the sun and would look into doing this and what's your pros and cons of it would certainly suit me as a single parent with three children and I want to go over a can't afford to do it as it is and obviously have no idea whether the club would be interesting looking to do that or not, but it's interesting concept is it seems yeah, I mean from the legs I'll do other clubs perspective is year especially some I like some dormant web.  Your turnover is probably in no small part based on season ticket sales. Are you leaving yourselves financially incredibly vulnerable. If you're in a situation where you could lose a big portion of your income from one month to the next and it's an interesting concept. I know it would certainly work for a lot of fans. Yeah something that balances. It's getting that balance in the kitchen. The club's perspective back could be  You know, you could certainly have a lot of financial black holes opening up if you're not getting the income that you expect and you need so yes in just gone to have you know, thinking on the spot about it. So but certainly that that was the first independent my head is that financially it would be very primitive planning at the club very very difficult I suppose but I can certainly see why it would work for a lot of fans Kyle Stewart from Alec He's 33 years old has been Sun and Fun since he was five. His question is working. You see his in five years from now. When what would you like from us?  I'm not sure if that's a question of the new owners possibly but Mark, I guess it's a trick once wasn't until the takeovers confirmed and they have a kind of outline their plans and their Vision but I guess the obvious answer would be primarily hopefully but it's not as easy as that either. No, of course, it's not an immediate UK. There's a host of clubs. You can look at the likes of Nottingham forest Sheffield Wednesday Legion 82. I'm sure when they were in ligue 1 if you'd asked them where they'd be in five years time. They have said the Premier League and as you say it's not as easy as it looks but you would hope obviously with the  Take over if it is drugs deliver as much as fans hope that the Premier League is a realistic kind of ambition for some than in five years time. It's difficult to say though when you don't know what their plans are what kind of level of investment they're looking to bring what kind of model they wanting to put into the club. It's really difficult to predict what you would hope, you know in a Ideal World that five years time sometimes will be back in the in the top flight.  We've got a couple of one of this is anonymous which we've already really answered. Will you run as we look at replaced John Ross? I think knows the answer to that one. Well, obviously, you know results are obviously dependent in any club, but but no generosity States is a secure certainly for now Kevin Deputy from Newton a cliff 51 years addicted to son and he says our fans right to question drafts at the moment in point in positions not been a bad start but we are where we are a big club and League one playing inconsistent times during all the games this season.  You've kind of answered that field but anything else you'd like to answer a bit of a difficult one as I guess. It's our expectation, isn't it? Well, yeah.  Yeah funds is perfectly fair question Jack Russells, though. It's the whole point football if there was no debate around it. We wouldn't be here. We wouldn't bother with it. So yeah, never criticize anyone for that. And as I've said before I would never criticize someone funds have been really really desperate to get promoted and moving the championship and and hopefully they're moving the Premier League. That's the whole point football is to push forward into  To achieve big memories and happy memories and kind of push on so you can't if when it comes from that place of just really desperately wanting the club to improve and kick on then there's fair enough. I mean, the only thing I would say is that  you know, I think Jack improves young players. I think he makes them better. Yes, the results have been frustrating probably this calendar year at times but he's meticulous organized incredibly hard-working is not spent a huge amount of money will grow your side. I think that transfers kind of distorted things if you look what he's trying to do, he's tried as best as possible to be targeted and bringing players who understand the club life potential who can grow who could maybe make the club some money further further down the line, so I still  There's no for lot of good that he's doing at the club. I don't think it's always helpful to kind of.  Sometimes it can be very very very up and down. That's just the reality of it life at a big Club. That's not always helpful in terms of having that long lens of improving the club over a long period of time and getting the culture right and that big question of how this club thrives and the divisions higher but you know, it is kind of as an alleged to before it's kind of a reality of where this clubs out and fortunately, but certainly if people you know, my own opinion would be that you know, he's the right person for it, but you can't criticize of the people with  Don't have that opinion. And certainly the reality is something I have not won loads and loads and loads and loads of football matches in 2019. So that's going to create create a bit and Jack will know better than anyone that the best thing you can do is go on a little running and kind of put that to bed. Charlie muffin shoes have been on not sure if it's his exact shoes. He lives in the beautiful city question. Do you feel the three main incoming investors will want to realize change quickly or slow and steady. I think I prefer slow and steady is in our previous pursuit of Premier. League's is stability basically meant  Throwing good money after bad time and time again until I eventually implosion. What properties do you think our new owners should address and in what order obviously they'll hopefully outline their priorities when they do hopefully take charge, but I guess if you obvious ones would be things like investment in the infrastructure and the academy buildings themselves at Stadium lighting the academy like which one's need a bit of TLC.  Funding the academy moving forward will be another and in terms of the investment in the squad. That would be limited. Anyway wouldn't in ligue 1 in terms of the terms antigens and to be honest like one it's one of the big problems with the system. One of the reasons why Barry went South is in league one. The reality is always can find ways to spend money on players if they want to I don't think it will but the reality is you can do that in the championship. You can't  you can't just throw money at it in the championship anymore. The picture has changed dramatically, but I do think as a general picture someone's You could argue a pretty fortunate to be getting a second chance at this in terms of having a lot of capital owners with it and resources to invest heavily. We had at the first time around and it was shut down the drain, you know, Ellie Shore and this isn't a personal criticism. It's just the reality is Legacy was  Relatively non-existent in terms of the structures that were built the infrastructure around the ground and the culture at the club wasn't really any kind of legacy to be honest. There's a lot that we already there in terms of the buildings wasn't and the money was chucked in and I think most people would be of the belief and of the argument that it was Ellis was didn't surround yourself with the right people and that's why things got things went down the drain really so from my perspective as a globe.  You should be looking at this and saying well, we've got a second chance at do what we didn't do the first time around which is build really really resilient structures that can the can last and actually produce success further down the line and make us less dependent on having to just Chuck money at players and what have you so that's my take on it. But you know, let's not pretend that wouldn't be exciting for came in and started signing. Yeah. Yeah signed big name players wouldn't be the way I went about with Anonymous wide-open seem to struggle with  basic defending this will cost is going up Mark. What's your take on that? You think there's a Jack Russell obviously highlighted in the post-match John Ross took the took the blame for like draw I was gonna say the fact that if only a defeat but dropped her on Tuesday and again highlighted, excuse me, The Chronic lack of clean sheets of season. So on and of played is it 10 games in total now? We're in the league that I haven't kept a clean sheet yet and he said successful teams generally need to keep  20 or so of the league campaign. So a lot of improvements to be made. Yeah, I think Jack Ross made a valid point in his press conference when he spoke about the fact that John McLaughlin probably hasn't made as many big saved as he had by this point last season. Yeah, there was some games not just the start of last season, but across the campaign where something's got points because John McLaughlin was making some some incredible saves and he's not doing that this year but teams are maybe being a little bit more clinical and a finishing the chances they are.  Getting and I think it's just momentary lapses sometimes, you know, you look at Tuesday night and it was just you know, the failure to clear kind of one one balls a hasty and you know, he doesn't make a mistake from that kind of range. It's something that needs to be addressed because when while they're not keeping clean sheets, they you know, they're already needing the score two goals to win and you know, the created enough chances to score two on on Tuesday night, but if you've got a you know, if you just have that kind of bad look,  You're not going to not going to find the back of the net more than once you need to be able to rely on your back line keeping those clean sheets, which at the moment some of them can't so it's something I'm sure Jack Ross obviously is a former. Defender himself will be Keen to address and hopefully once they get that first clean sheet that just gives them that little bit of confidence that little bit of a reminder that you know, maybe does not an error in as and they can push on a little bit and maybe not hit that 20 Mark now, but hopefully maybe get up and around that and start taking the burden off the strikers a little bit I guess so  his acceptance of the games will be more open given the formation system some of the plane and even upper body image is it it's a strange one in that. Obviously. I know Jax obviously right in clean sheets in it a massive difference having said that the last kind of if you're back to the Portsmouth came the way someone to set up the formation of played the style of played think it's pretty difficult to keep clean sheets playing that way. Mmm plane to very very Orthodox trait is to Wing is not wide midfielders. Let's get a right, you know Linda need in a knot.  You failed as they are Wing as they tend not to do a huge amount going back either way. So I think it's very difficult to keep clean sheets and that environment and that isn't a massive concern for me if they keep creating a number of chances they have in the last few games, but because I just I just think you can focus too much on the Inland defend individuals in that sense. I think at the moment someone to play in the way that makes it pretty difficult to keep clean cheek to be honest. And I don't necessarily I don't even really say that as a criticism. I think they look at the other night. They try to win the game.  Game and didn't want to draw a game 1-1. They chucked a lot of players on I as I said before, I think they could have handled the situation better. But the reality is the deliberately it was a very very open game. So so can it's a tough conundrum to solve. I mean, I guess Bonds in Luton were pretty attacking last year and played two Strikers and we're able still to still to keep clean sheets. So it definitely can be done some something needs to be done. But you know if switch have only conceded for girls which is why they are where they are, but I don't think the players expansive someone do they're very direct.  So yeah, it's an interesting interesting conundrum of interesting is they have Jack tries to try to solve and in the coming weeks as you say McGuire why kind of great girl came off the bench didn't choose nice and must be one of the strongest benches. Only one recent years. It was a strong strong options From. The Bench are Peter Forsythe from Clayton is supported summoned for approaching 60 years. His question is given the misfiring of week and Grigg misfiring. Although it was probably a bit harsh on on why colder thought given these I got a couple thousand already this season miss one game for the suspension and with  All due respect the current Striker coaches would be possible to bring in it for a short period of Specialists strike a coach or foremost traps top Striker to work with the from guys to improve their finishing. Thanks Peter. I mean something that's got quite a lot of goals this season. I would question whether that's the main issue for the club as you've already discussed in depth. It's probably more getting that balance right the other end of the pitch. Yeah. I mean, you know, you got the out and getting the compound composure in the final third was was outstanding all three girls real quality Lynn.  Just the well Greg conundrum. Is this one night? It's quite something. I don't have the answer to it's difficult to work out of than the say of it. It's performance this for a while now coming off the bench have been. Okay. So that makes you think the truly the girls will follow and I'm going to pretend I have the answer to that particular puzzle.  Paul parking from Durham and now living in Cyprus. I'll just read all this out. It's more of a comment regarding than a question but a support the lad since 1973 and his dad took me to the junction of the A1 M and A 692 watch them and bring home the FA Cup in an open-top bus. He was eight years old at the time you started going to games with his friends at the age of 13 and starting his own son a rocker Park when he was five years old. We'll watch The Lads wherever we can the last games Akron in the cup game a couple of weeks back Jack Ross is right about the negativity around the clubhouse.  Don't you think that plays need to take responsibility for doing something about that on the pitch? Can you really blame supporters who have endured years of disappointment last season's fairly to get promoted in the Wembley defeat is it not for chat Ross on the players to show some show some grit on the pitch and they give the funds something positive and consistent to shout about we don't seem to be able to play two half of the same way against rather. It was great until the penalty missing then terrible other sports psychologists doing enough re the confidence and the resilience a lot of interesting.  Points raised there by Paul obviously just on the negativity show. I guess it works both ways. Doesn't the players have got to give the fans something to cheer about and generally I would argue that I've done over the last 15 months or so. Yeah. I mean they've delivered two trips to Wembley, which is you know would have been Unthinkable a few years ago to get two trips to Wembley within the space of kind of three months. Obviously. It's unfortunate the circumstances that come in in terms of sudden and being in League one, but yeah, pause definitely got some some valid points that the players have got to do to deliver.  I think that as you say large about the last 15 months they have and I think it's easy and isolation to take results and not necessarily blow them out of proportion. But Focus maybe a little bit too much on on one negative result or one negative aspect of someone's performance is rather than looking at the Grand picture that the club is in a far far better place than it was 15 months ago with players that want to be here and do want to do their best for Sun and Anonymous has been prolific this week's been back on their album. Second half shows we are crying out for  Leadership on the pitch. How do we again have a captain that isn't a regular starter and Grant little bit and Chris Maguire were obviously dropped out of the bench for the game on Tuesday. Although McGwire has had a slight ankle issue, which I think you picked up against Pete Brittany. What did he miss the people game unless it's a bit of a game with that and then played against Akron and John Ross didn't felt he was fully able to start a second game in quick succession Grant little bit. He was Keen to just mix things up a little bit in that area of the pitch. We talked a lot about the way rather than rather than play.  This was a bit of an issue wasn't the first couple weeks we'll add bit but then he did get a fairly lengthy running the team. Is it important to always have the captain start? No, I don't mean the captain seemed that isn't football at all here. Especially my this is my opinion of the people who disagree I don't think it can seem like some football or it's quite odd places on in the could comfortably wear that and then it wouldn't be you know, this there was plenty of leadership in terms of experience. And what have you on the pitch for that last however long yeah, I don't add for me. It's completed.  Servants who has the am band and who who has on the pitch at the time? I don't think it makes any difference whatsoever. I'd only you could see it wasn't enough leadership or experience on that pitch in the last 20 minutes. Yeah, as I've said, I don't think performance was great. I think it could have been handled North lot better and I don't know you could say there wasn't enough experience or enough people who should have leadership skills and my you know, even the gate he's played in the played in the championship. Yeah, one of the biggest clubs in the world for a long time. So yeah it just on Ledbetter himself. I mean he's  Threes and these dreams realities not he's not going to play three games in a week. It's it's not sustainable to expect that. You know, it's going to be a long long season. You don't want like the burning out or not being able to contribute in the last couple months to seize and when I might be really tense and difficult games, that's when you want someone like him on the pitch. So and WX had a good season so far choose night probably wasn't his best showing of the Season having said that I didn't you do did great deal wrong, and he looks really good player. So,  I think that's a good position to be and where you can drop Grand on the bench every now and then get some get some rest in him and you've got to play a similar blue and come in execute the same role really. Well, that's it's a healthy position to be in not a not a but not negative 1 well under this John from Sutherland 58 supported us for as long as he can remember and he says he said room is the new tale of a team would like to expand the seating capacity by building extra seats at the stadium. Is there any truth in this it was certainly the case wasn't with my Campbell's takeover bid. That was one of their potential plans.  Extend the capacity of the stadium of Light which they felt they could do quite quickly which are things which I think is the case isn't with the stadium like that. If there was the need to do that. You can expand it relatively easy as these things go as I said, we we haven't heard from well the deal isn't done yet until it's done. So we are now from the new owners yet as to what their plans will be, but I would be surprised if that will be a priority and imagine it might well be on the list, but imagine it would be very early.  Fairly low down the opportunity is still not working on normal match this exactly what quite lonely up there and prestes any minute good stuff.

spotify:episode:0Fg2g7eNnVBUj9FmtN8uKd	Hey, what's up, this is Uncle Sharma from the other school podcast. Welcome to the session number one. So, thank you so much for your patience. I know a lot of you have been waiting for for information about when the broadcast was going to go live because knowing you might be listening to it on your way or one of the gym or something wherever you are listening. Thank you. I really appreciate it. So today's session is going to be a bit different from the norm. I'm going to be going over a quick introduction of who I am and introduction of what they don't teach you at school. So what it means and how to learn these essential lessons and also a kind of formalities of the show. And also I'm going to talk about why I'm really hosting this podcast. No, not only  How it benefits me but more importantly how it benefits you and why you should keep listening and future. So thank you for listening and I hope to be able to provide you with some awesome content on this podcast. I don't want it to be a waste of your time and I want to get rid of all the fluff and chitchat that I hear in a lot of podcast and just give you that great content that you can put to use right away.  From teenage Finance earning money to personality Improvement. I will take you to the depths of its attentions. I like the useless algebra and facts that are of no practical use and getting successful in life. So before I get into who I am, I want to talk about really quick the tagline of the show what they don't teach you at school on school so I have been reading  Books for past three years and that's where my journey foreign school begin applying all the learnings from the self-help books in real life. I started finding ways to get better at Finance money emotions Communications habit everything. I used to struggle with made me alone something and now I'm going to teach you the same knowing you don't have the time to read all those books.  And I will provide you the sieved working principles to get your life place. So on school is basically rewiring you what do you have been misread or overfed in school and learning the essential from the square? So now something I really want to convey that I had at the beginning of every show because you do have to work.  You do have to just brush it. Take your passion do whatever you love to do and just crush it. And if you do that, you will see the benefits later if you use the on school models and lessons that I'm going to teach you here on the show are the activities I will give you you can build a highly productive stress-free life with the system. It works. Trust me. I don't know it sounds scammy, but  It really it really works. I mean, I'm living it making money since first year of my college. I had initially put in all the work that was required to set up those things. So that is what the tagline is all about. The best thing is learning in streets and from work you are open to the entire world of facts and teachings. So I want to introduce you really quick in case you don't know me who I am.  I am again. My name is unkosher Mom. I'm a learner of Entrepreneurship and life. I'm graduating from PA you with a degree in p-tech biotechnology, but it's not where it all started. It started with GE joint entrance examination. The toughest undergrad exam. It made me realize the unfit education system. I was a high achiever until I failed with securing a seat in IID getting into a hole.  Role of biotechnology also hit it made me unwire. I was at zero and was going to learn everything from scrap about biology unlike others in the degree. I had a bad time for having the facts and college expenses added more to disaster. Everything was OST overhead transmission. This loser feeling made me motivated to take charge of my life and get it back on track. So I decided to get up my  My grades better but it wasn't easy as it sounds like I ended up scoring just three points more than the passing grade points enemies were losing all the money. I had in the first week and socially physically mentally and emotionally ground that I started working part-time to afford investing in courses box gym memberships. I ended up working hours every day actually didn't need any money to make a living but to learn  How to live so this is where my learning phase started I started investing in myself and worked on every little aspect of the life from aggression emotions communication to money finance and startups. So it is the best feeling in the world to see yourself growing and to be able to know your own fallacies and fault and approving it bit by bit. The first lesson I would like to teach you is  take charge of your life. There's nothing you can't change. Once you start taking responsibility of your whatever's happening to you. That's where you will start winning. I was lowered immunity along with all this I used to stay say call you once I took the responsibility off my own self and stop blaming it changed a lot. So that is where I got started and today I started on school just as a thing things started getting  All because I really want to show people what is real learning and how you can Master the art of learning and Improvement. The second introductory lesson. I would like to share is the Benedict what I mean by this is your view the point of view or you can say the glasses with which you see the world. It may be blue, but you might see it filtered with the color of your shades of panting so bad. The game is what hinders your growth and  Improvement because when you hold your thought that Shield yourself not to be penetrated by any other view you get trapped this leads to arguments and reluctance to learn and listen, I believe the principle of radical shift is simple. Just listen when you listen you learn what you don't know the only barrier I feel for Patty Kim shift is peeking.  Because when you speak you restrict your thoughts and become incapable to understand either right or wrong you feel you're right because you haven't seen the other side of the coin. So when I set it up, it didn't take a lot of time. I did take a lot of efforts, but I'm so glad I spent the time and invested the time because now I'm seeing the returns every single move. So like I said, I wasn't in and kind of just started.  With mistakes, learn the theories and principles of on school unschooling myself. The thing about me is that what makes me happy is helping people the more you help people the more willing they are to help you back. So it's spreading the word Karma exists online the more you help people the more you do nice things for people. The better things will happen to you the principal copies to everything you want to learn.  Teach you want to earn give Fast and so on kind of where I'm coming from. I'm just a regular guy. I don't have an MBA. I don't never took but I probably now no Essentials. You need to know about money Finance income tax Banks waiting investment. It's all about just putting yourself out there taking leaps of Faith taking bold actions and making things happen. You can't  plan and plan and read all you want but you got to take actions and that's what it's really all about. That's what I am here to try to get you up to. That's why these shows are pretty short so that you can take actions right away. So when I have guests we are going to be talking about actions principles that you can take so that when you are done listening to this you can go and do something with your money life emotions and personality.  So now let's talk about the format of the show moving on to different segments of the session this regarding like I said earlier this regarding is a little special because it's our first one but a normal episode would be like this. So it will be about 25 minutes in length, which is long enough to get into really Into the Depths on one or two particular topics, but short enough so I don't drag you along and waste your time.  I think it will force me as a host to make sure we will hit on really important points right away. And let's see we are going to cover one or two topics regarding entrepreneurship emotional management personal finance or productivity teenage problems, and it may be just me or on the mic like it's today or I might bring in a special guest to help you dig deeper into the topic, especially if that person is an expert.  Or an authority on that particular topic, we will definitely ask him some great questions and hopefully get some actionable items from them and after that in each episode, I would like to include something that's called. What's working for me segment. I am going to be asking any guests that are on what's working for them. And if I don't have guests I will take about what's working for me.  Me but this is the part of the show where I want you to be able to take away something and do it right away. So I am doing this podcast to try and become a better speaker to be better behind the microphone. Just putting myself out there throwing myself into deep and and doing it. That's exactly how I got into one school. So hopefully you will be along with me for the ride.  The second reason and probably obviously most important is I am here to help you everything. I publish everything. I am saying here on this podcast is here for you. If you email me if you leave comments, I will respond. Like I said earlier. I'm sure it will come back to me and I could pay it. Will it already has and I'm just trying to keep that going and trying to help as many people.  As I can that's exactly why I'm doing this podcast. Maybe you found me through iTunes or some kind of podcasting directory or just a recommendation from a friend or some so now before I go I'm going to give you one tip that hopefully you can take away from the first session and there is not to be afraid of  Not to be afraid of failing. I'm doing this podcast. I don't care what happens because know that I'm going to learn from my experiences. If you're not afraid to fail you won't be afraid to take chances and step out of your comfort zone and reach super crazy higher levels of success that you can even imagine right now for me. It was only when I took those World actions stepping out of my comfort zone.  I think those chances that I finally got somewhere. I finally saw results. So my income Skyrocket and my life started to change. I failed a bazillions of times along the way but I embraced each and every of those failures because it got me to the point. I am today in my life. So don't be afraid to fail failing is good right not to fail do your best but if  If you do fail learn from it learn from your mistakes if you just fail and don't learn anything, then you really really feel so do your best and if you fail learn from the rest, all right, so thank you for listening to this very first session of the unschooled podcast. Hope to hear from you again soon, and I will see you in the next session. Take care.  By the way, thank you for listening to the on school podcast.

spotify:episode:0JazRbunxymipOTwKzvTas	Hey everybody, it's Bevin. Welcome to Bevin FM over 40 and her friends podcast. This is me, Bevin. I've said my name three times. It's time to start the show. I'm so excited that you've tuned in welcome today. I'm going to talk about some big stuff going on. So first of all, I want to talk about some big changes happening in my life. And I'm going to talk about some of the key learnings that I got when I took a social media Hiatus for four months. So first and foremost I am  Announce this at the top of the last episode that I am moving next month this month. I'm moving in three weeks. Basically I am getting rid of 85% of what I own. This is a made-up estimate of this is just based on how much space I have available to me to store my possessions for when I get another place to live that as my own. But basically I am subleasing a tiny house down the street from my mom and because it's like TurnKey, right?  Please I will show up with me my cat which is the most important thing is that I get to keep my cat all of his needs and he's a special needs cats. He's got a lot of meds and things he needs all of my toiletries, which is not a small than ever. It's not small situation. My mom gave me this toiletries carrying case once it's like truly for like full-size bottles of things and it has proved I was it was in the giveaway pile until I realize I was moving and then I pulled it out of the giveaway pile because I  like actually this is gonna be my bathroom for the next six months because it's going to store all of my full-size products because you know, she this is a I believe in natural beauty, but I also believe in doing what you need to do to take great care of yourself and I take great care of myself. And so all my bathroom stuff is just when then closed just like season will close because I'm moving someplace that has a proper fall proper winter proper Cold Spring and I'm moving very close to the border of Canada. Actually I can see Canada from  Tiny house. I've never actually looked at the view intentionally from this house that I'm renting but I have looked extensively At This Woman's Garden. So I'm actually really excited to go and get to just like really get intimate with that that space I yeah, so like and then I'll probably bring some jigsaw puzzles and some art to work on in the winter, but my plan is to move into this tiny house have my living expenses basically reduced.  Bye.  It's like whatever 5/6 is in percent. I'm going down five six and how much my living expenses are maybe even more than that because you know the power bills and the water bills at a house that has a front yard and backyard or not a joke. So anyway, I'm just like basically doing a fire sale of all of my belongings. I have found just you know, so far Craigslist is over. It's all about Facebook Marketplace. And since I've been selling on Facebook Marketplace things have been  Really quickly. I was trying to sell a bunch of stuff on Craigslist before because I didn't really want all my friends in my business. And now I realize that was foolhardy. I should have been selling on Facebook all along but you know, I kind of like how I got to the decision is really like, I think I know I think I just needed to really give it a shot to stay in La I prayed for guidance and in May I was just like praying for guidance. Like what's my next step? And what do I do?  And do I need to stay in LA or do I leave LA and I got the guidance that I needed to stay in La for at least six months and November 1st will be six months from right about when that decision came through. So where that call came through and so that seems about right. I have no reason to stay in La like nothing is keeping me here. I tried so hard to get a job. I tried so hard to get a roommate. I tried so hard at short-term rentals of my extra room my house and just like nothing gel.  Thing came to fruition. I had a lot of last-minute Miracles that made me able to pay my rent for the last six months and just like barely ich by I've been eating on less than five dollars a day and when you're mostly trading all of your time for money eating I'm less than five dollars a day is not decadent and it's hard like because I can eat pretty well on a budget if I have time to cook, but if I don't have time to cook then it's a lot of like rice-based meals and which is fine like and five dollars a day.  Is still a lot actually for a lot of people's food budgets and but like, you know, when you can't have convenience food or convenience food isn't really available to you and your in your your time schedule it like it's just I feel like I've been incomplete survival mode for the last six seven months and I'm tired and I can't do it anymore like and there is nothing in La that's keeping me here in order to pay these exorbitant rents. And like I just can't afford to keep this house in this house was like why I want to too  Stay in La I was like, I'll stay here if I can stay in this really awesome house that I love so much. So it's like it feels in many ways like my therapist. Who by the way, I'm so sad. I don't get to keep my therapist because it's like we do remote sessions over the phone, but he's licensed in California and he won't get a Washington license just to counsel me. So I'm hopeful that we can have a little Bridge time. So I don't just like move and have no therapy support because therapy is actually been really helpful for me.  But he did remind me before before I made this decision like in that last week where I was like, what's the miracle going to be? How am I going to pay this rent? And he was like you were in this situation because of your breakup. This is not a personal failure of yours. This is just a circumstance of where your life has been and you can't blame yourself for it which like I'm a Capricorn. It's my it's my nature to blame myself for everything and every shortcoming and so I've recently learned that one of the best things that Capricorn  Do is adopt some of those Leo characteristics where Leo's are really about like being proud of their accomplishments and like knowing how far they've come and I think as a Capricorn, you know, it's the symbol of that goat climbing up the mountain and sometimes I get really caught up with where the next point and the mountain is instead of turning around and looking at how far I've come and I'm really proud of myself for making it work as long as I did and I'm really proud of myself for like continuing to connect with other human beings.  Beings create Circles of people around me who are supportive of the mindsets. I want to have and like who I'm becoming in my life and seeking out spiritual Community here in La when I knew that was lacking after my breakup and you know, really giving it a shot and I've Loved this town and like I was driving Rideshare. I was doing lift as a driver for a long time like 50 60 hour weeks doing lift and I  Even make my ends meet working that hard and that is really sad and I think it just kind of goes to show how underpaid Rideshare drivers are by the way always tip your driver like always it's a thing. It's like it's like you tip at a restaurant tip your driver the take-home pay from lift. By the way, if you're thinking of doing it is about 10 bucks an hour before taxes after expenses and before tips. So just just so you know, that's what the person's making who's driving around. They are not making I made about thirty percent of  every Fair which like lift. I don't know. There's something someone Googled in the back of my left base of well on Google. It says blah blah blah, but I want you to remind I want to remind you that I mean and maybe it's just true in La that they're taking about 75% off the top but about 7075 percent. It's so bananas. Sometimes I'll drive someone and I'll make two dollars and sixty two cents and they spent $10 on that red. It is cuckoo anyway, so just to say tip your Rideshare drivers and it's not  Is sustainable income and less you can work 50 to 60 hours a week and even then kind of depending on how heavy expenses are I still have like basically I'm listening to what my body says and my body told me I couldn't drive Rideshare anymore. Like I have this ongoing muscle ache that's in the full back of my leg and my foot is still pretty injured the my driving foot. So it's just from like that. Stop start. Stop start mom traffic e days, so I gave it a shot.  I can safely I really tried to be an ally and it wasn't even like I was trying to be an actress or something like that something. That was La specific. I was just trying to like keep the great house that I loved and try to like thrive in this life that was set up for me when I had a partner whose business made over a hundred fifty thousand dollars a year and I helped her build that business and you know, it is what it is. Like wish we wish we had gotten married and I got alimony, but kind of glad we didn't get married so that this can just be over.  And so now I depart la for the border of Canada. I'm going to live down the street from my mother which I'm actually really excited about I love my mom. She and I have the best relationship we've had in our whole lives. Like I think that's due in large part to both of us having a lot of personal growth. I also she also recently sent me her astrological chart and you really know you're cool with me if I'm like. Hey, what's your birth data so I can look up your astrological chart and so like learning more about  my mom's stuff and how like that it just it all made sense. Once I saw it. I was like, oh my God a Sagittarius moon. Oh my God, right like my mom is amazing. And I'm glad to just get the opportunity to see what it's like to live down the street from her. I've never had that experience. I always kind of thought it was weird when people stayed in the same town as their parents because like I moved away when I was 17 years old. I have not ever lived at home again, and I'm technically not living at home because I didn't grow up where my mom lives now.  She retired up to the Olympic National Forest. She literally lives in the forest and a little tiny village. And so and most of the people leave during the winter. So it's going to be really isolated. I'm hoping to get a great job that like pays my bills and that I can leave at work and I'm going to keep building. I have a couple businesses obviously, you know about faka dance party aerobics, which is my aerobics class that I created for everybody who's left behind by mainstream Fitness and  it hasn't been something I can devote a ton of time on lately. So I've been needing to trade my time for money and the business is not at a point where it can support me financially full-time. So I've been focusing mostly just on my online Pursuits with it. So I've been online weekly aerobics class that you can get through. My patreon patreon is a membership site. It's like crowdfunding meets a membership subscription and for 25 bucks a month. You can take my weekly online aerobics best. And so that has been what I've been  Focusing on because I want it to be able to reach as many people as possible. And this was before I even was thinking that I was going to move away. But now I'm glad like I've been investing in that so that is still ongoing. Its I've never stopped. I've been doing this class every week for the last like since I launched in January, so keep on teaching was online or hybrid class join me anytime you get four classes available to you every month of different lengths. So there's a 10-minute a 20-minute a 45  Minute and a 60 Minute class and I love doing it. I love teaching aerobics the other day. I taught my last La class for a while to a couple of my regulars from LA and it was just like I was like, I love teaching this class. I love doing this. Yeah, and I also have my online workout videos which so funny because my I think the episode 4 is about spirituality and I talked at length about Kyle cease and how his stuff has really he's like a teacher Guru.  And he's really taught me a lot just by being a member of his absolutely everything community and I was I got picked to be on his weekly call which is kind of a big deal and I got picked from my question which it was like basically, how do I know when it's time to quit like, I'm really working hard to stay in this house, but everything seems like it's not working and he didn't actually answer my question, but he like loved the fact that dance party stuff and he loved Frankie dance party and he was like you have to do this.  Have to share this like blah blah blah. So I'm also really not interested in having investors. So it's like something that's got to be built on the side. So I've got that I am intending to continue sharing back a dance party and figuring out what's next but trying to work smarter not harder because I spent a lot of time the last couple of years like when I had the privilege of having someone paying my rent then I'm grateful that I was able to build it, but I was able to kind of try a lot of stuff and  screw up a lot of stuff and like make mistakes and I didn't have a mentor helping me like build it because I was just kind of making it up and like figuring stuff out and like that's I really just saw lack of mentorship in my life like affecting like how I was able to move it forward and now yeah, so now like I see because of the people I got connected to and the the learnings I've done in the last six months staying in La I like I see clearly why  To be here for this time. And also I just don't see staying which is sad because like there are some some people that I did get connected to who are like phenomenal and I would love friends if we talk on my offline. I will tell you all about it, but basically like changed the course of my life changed the trajectory really helping me move some specific personal gross stuff and I'm going to aggressively work to pay off debt. I haven't fully totaled all of my debt, but I think my debt is in the neighborhood of $150,000.  Out of which is student debt left over from a law degree. I don't even use anymore because I you know, just. Lawyers have four times the national rate of suicide and I am not interested in being a lawyer. So I that proved out to me every single time. I've had a lot of job. I've been more suicidal then when I don't and the last time I had a nine-to-five la job which you know, a lot of job is like more like I would say it's like 9 to 9 and every time I was communicating to that  I was on the subway. This is when I was in New York and I would just contemplating suicide was contemplating jumping on the track every time and I never equated like oh this bullying environment that's like argumentative environment and never equated that to like my mental health and why I was having those ideations and now I just like have way more of an awareness of myself. And so anyway, I don't know what industry I'm going to go into. I'm just keeping an open mind and looking for that and like working on building a whole nother business.  This that I'm not even public about and that is my retirement plan and my hope is to retire up where my mom lives and my hope is to retire in the next few years. And you know, that doesn't mean I'll ever stop doing that dance party because I think that's my heart work and I think that's where I meant to serve on a global scale and help sort of shift The Narrative around dance aerobics and fat people Fitness and fat people. And also I'd love it. I love doing dance aerobics and I love sharing it with people.  And I want to you know live to be supported but I don't I would love to be supported by faculty and party aerobics and I haven't like fully like given up. Hope on that but I'm certainly not like hinging on it because there's just so many things that go into whether or not a business is profitable. And so I'm going to get a bill paying job keep working on my retirement business and keep pushing forward FAQ a dance party. That is also a specific question that I was asked by a friend when I was catching.  Hang up today is like what are you doing effective dance party? So rest assured I will still be filming my weekly classes probably with some of my mom's retirement buddies. Hopefully being in the background of my videos and them probably I don't know that I can record aerobics in a tiny house, but they have like a lodge that I can probably use and anyway, so I'm excited to share with you from there. And obviously I'm going to continue doing this podcast and so you'll hear it.  About my life. And yeah, so I'm excited about just the possibilities obviously like opening up for me because I'm willing to make so much change. This is a thing I've learned from Kyle sees is that whenever you're stuck or whenever things are really frustrating just do the opposite of the thing you were doing before. So in this instance, I've lived Urban my entire adult life since I was 20, I think 20 I  Go to Philadelphia and I've lived in Philly and New York City and Los Angeles and I before that lived in suburbs and so I have never lived rural in my whole life. So I'm literally going to be living. I'm on the very edge of like the little village that my mom is in. So I'm like in the farthest corner lot. And so I'm like, wow, I'm like literally going to be like facing the forest all day long. Like what's that going to be? Like am I going to fully become Snow White will the mice and the bunny?  And the deer and the birds follow me around and I just going to sing songs to them. This is like I'm really kind of picturing. My life is some some sort of weird hybrid between like like Disney princess and a small town CW plot like, you know divorce a former lawyer moves boomerangs to her mom's retirement community lives in the woods. The closest town is like 9,000 people and  Like how maybe I'll meet a lonely widower who needs to learn about the spirit of Christmas or something. I don't know. Like I just like have to be positive about it because like optimism is the price of entry for being an entrepreneur and believing in yourself and like honestly like I would prefer to be optimistic then depressed and that's my other option and I'm not taking it because I am moving forward. I am already planning to get my seasonal affective disorder lamp. I've already started dosing myself.  Stuff with vitamin D three times a day. I'm ready to pry myself for self-care because I want to see what it's like for me to just Thrive instead of having to be in survival mode. I've been in survival mode. Like honestly like Dara sent me this shitty awful email blaming me for everything wrong in our relationship a year ago like a year and change ago. We just hit that year mark up a few days ago and I'm like, wow, my life has been like upside down like my wedding got cancelled like everything has been upside down.  For a year, I am over it. I am ready to just keep moving forward and like like I feel like in the last few months just like since she withdrew her support financially for me. I've just been like sinking into debt and like not getting ahead and I'm tired of it like I want to thrive and so it's kind of like when I moved to LA and I was like, ooh, what will my life be like when I don't have to fight seasonal affective disorder and live in New York City for six months a year because it really just felt like I was like trying to just  Just basically feel okay and instead of like thriving and then in La like I got to focus all that stuff care. I'm just thriving and I worked I love living in LA and I've really bloomed here. But I think this will be even better like having less money demands on my life and like being so in with nature, I think that I can Thrive even more and I'm excited to see what what that looks like. So stay tuned. I will keep you updated. We're going to take a quick music.  Jake and then we'll be right back. So West Coast wave goddess some were chilling on the balcony on the beach mobile some Haze.  I woke up on the island feeling Grand. I'm the queen of this Lane Highway weeks.

Okay, welcome back. That was Lizzie Jeff with ladybug free a recent drop. I was introduced to Lizzie Jeff by Ashley Manta who is who introduced me to Deidre Bliss who was in my last episode. So I feel like this is like all part of this beautiful Nexus of blowing goddesses. I'm really stoked about it. I love Lizzie Jeff stuff. Okay, so I wanted to talk about like the  That's of deciding to leave Los Angeles and like my perspective on it. I think that some may perceive or I guess there's a pot like there's a way to look at it where I failed to thrive in La like I didn't, you know do the thing. I couldn't support myself and I you know, I went at length and episode 2 about like what I learned from allowing myself to be supported by my partner and a lot of people have told me not to be so hard on myself.  Elf and again hashtag Capricorn problems like it's hard for me not to take personal responsibility because I really truly believe that I am the creator of my own life and I think I really needed for my heart and for my maybe even my ego. I just needed to like really give La a shot and really try to do it myself. If I was meant to be here and I tried really hard. I tried everything I could to get a roommate or job. If either of those things had come through I probably wouldn't need to leave la  Um, but it's so interesting that it neither did and I really never look at things as failures or I work hard to not look at things as failures. I work hard to perceive my failures as lessons because I think when you fail at something it is a lesson that you are doomed to repeat if you choose not to learn the lesson or even look at it or examine it and so for me, I feel like it's such a great lesson such a good learning and also I don't think that  That I failed at anything. I think this is just like I thought that you know staying in La was probably what was meant for me and like turns out that's not what was meant to happen. And I don't feel like moving down the street from my mom is like anything but an awesome next step in my life like I moving out here and getting to live so close to my grandmother for the last year of her life, which I didn't know was her last year was such an opportunity that like I knew  That my next up after Allah or even like actually had visioned for myself to live part-time near my mom and live up there. So it seems interesting that now like it's just not exactly how I decided it was going to be it's just what is happening. And what's it kind of like my path of least resistance, right? Like I didn't have enough money to pay rent and I like have to borrow the money in order to move and getting into further debt, which I don't want.  But you know, it does mean that I can like start sort of turning the ship around a lot swifter because these fences are just so much lower up there. I've also you know what I'm excited to do something different than what I've been doing right like so I get to do the opposite of what I've been doing which I think will accelerate my personal growth and I also am just like kind of excited to see what happens with my life and what's possible for me out of all of this and  And you know, I think life does get to be as easy as it can be. I think there really is a path of least resistance often that were ignoring because we're so used to things of value needing to be work and that's like a capitalist mindset where your productivity measures your worth or your results measure you're worth but I think I'm worthy no matter what I also think. You're worthy. No matter what you were the exactly as you are and I just don't feel like I have anything  To prove right? Like I'm I know no matter what I'm going to keep growing and I'm going to keep being an awesome badass and I'm going to get better at being me every year. I'm going to become a more exalted and authentic version of myself. I'm going to have more joy and more spirit because I'm continuing to step forward on my journey and learn the lessons that come my way. I heard recently that like 90% of life gets to be easy and 10% are these like  Necessary lessons we have to learn and and that's like a spiritual perspective on life and struggle and I think anything worth doing is worth fighting through resistance. And anytime you're doing something great. Like that's when resistance flares but most if you haven't read the book The War of art, I really recommend it. My mentors have me reading some books and really looking at resistance in the role of resistance in life. And I have decided there's like two areas where I'm willing to run a pill  and and that's you know, building business and personal growth, but I don't think I need to run uphill in every area of my life and it is like just the way that things kind of came together for me to move down the street from my mom like this house was available and like my mom had a storage space that she was subletting to someone else who like literally like when I needed when I had made the Declaration like I think I need to move my  My mom was like my mom's friend was like, oh we're leaving the storage space. So it's like all lining up super well and super easily and like I feel super grateful for like the work that my mom has done to help me line this stuff up, but also my mom downsized within the last few years, so she had wisdom to offer me one of my besties also downsized or like kind of combine households with her partner or fiance and now I've you know, she was like telling me on the phone the other day.  She's like, I hope this isn't super bossy and I'm like no you've literally done exactly what I'm trying to do. Please tell me how you've done this because like I think in life often, we take the opinions of strangers really seriously, like we're really concerned about what other people think I'm really only concerned about the opinions of people who have done what I want to be doing, right? So she has successfully sold a bunch of stuff from downsizing. I want that. My mom has successfully downsized her life into a place where she doesn't need a big  George unit, right so she has fruit on that treat. So I'm taking advice from those people. And anyways, I think it's just important to like have a good perspective on my life and like why I'm making the choices. I'm making I feel super happy. Actually that I had the experience of Summer of going on a full social media Hiatus. I have been producing content like personal content online like personal narrative since 2002, so  Had a Blog since then various incarnations, but like have been public on the internet since pretty much you could be and then the summer or the spring summer. I went off social media was just too became really toxic for me. It was my mental health was suffering deeply not just because of that but because of circumstances of my life C episode 2 and I needed to take a break I needed to do something different. I really really really love social media. I think social media gives us access to a  At form and it gives us access not only us as creators access to platforms. But I think social media also gives us as consumers access to mindsets and connections to people that are really powerful and can really powerfully impact our life. I think that one of the most toxic things we consume is our media TV shows commercials apps, all of these things can be incredibly toxic and can be incredibly degrading to  Our sense of self to our empowerment to who were meant to be in this world, right? And if you're spending any time at all paying attention and I use that term very specifically you are paying attention because you have two primary resources in your life time and money and when you spend your time paying attention to someone that's a real thing like that's value that you're giving with your attention, right? So you're allowing someone to have impact on you and if they are making you feel  The shitty if they are making you feel less than if you are like deeply in compare and despair and it might not even be that person's fault. It may just be your toxic interaction with that person, right? Because like you're triggered by that person and you're getting into this feedback loop step away take a like unfollow anybody that makes you feel less than unfollow. Anybody that does not help inspire you to be your most confident self and and it may not even have to do with the content. They're creating. It may just have to do with like the way you're in.  Acting with them as a person and you just need to take a break in that's okay, but there are tons of people out there who are who are really pumping out kindness and inspiration and joy, and that's why I like to ask my guests on the show who they're following on Instagram who they love because I want you to be able to have ideas of people that you can connect to who can sew into your life and who can help you sort of raise your vibration and become the best version of yourself, which is what I want for you and also PS thanks for tuning.  Me into my podcast. Thank you for paying attention to me. I really appreciate it. And I'd love sharing this stuff and it's helpful to like have people who were listening because if it's a if I'm just like recording audio on my house and don't have an audience. That's not really a podcast. Right? So what I realized I took a social media Hiatus because I saw the toxic impact on my life and I was like I need to do something else. So what I started doing with all that time because I realized so I'd love social media right? Like I love it. I only follow  Go who I love I only like I'm constantly like evaluating. Do I love this person? Are they adding value to me? Like right like so anybody who says that they feel shitty after scrolling social media too long. I mean, I think number one like so much scrolling, right? Like I don't think it's good for you but never to like follow people that Vibe you up and make you feel great, right like dipping in and out of Instagram can be something that makes you feel better about the world because you're curating your own media feed. You're not letting CBS or NBC make  Asians about what you're listening to that's that was a bygone era and now we have way more personal autonomy when it comes to what we're consuming. So instead of being on social media, I you know cuz you can't just take something out you need to replace it. So I replaced it with an hour of meditation everyday I have was on social media probably creating content for about an hour a day and then consuming content for about 3 hours a day. It was bananas at my height. And so  When I went off social media I had more time. So I was meditating an hour. I also like was working at a time. So it was helpful because I was driving Rideshare so much. I was basically just talking to real people in real life and making real connections with them rather than like just having the social media thing which like I think social media is good for Content similar to reading a book or watching a television show. I do not think it's good for social and human connection. I think human connection actually requires a connection.  AKA get on the phone with people. I was also replacing it with phone calls. I have talked to so many of my friends on the phone and the last few months. It's amazing. I can tell a significant difference between my mood on a day when I've talked to three to four to five people on the phone then just 0 to 2. There's death. I just like that human interaction that human connection cannot be duplicated. I think be a digital means it's not texting. It's not sending DMC on Instagram it is  Only talking on the telephone or having a video chat conversation with someone. I've all the eyeball voice The Voice something like that. That isn't meaningful human connection humans are a tribal species. That means that we thrive on social connection. It's actually really vital to us. And when I was on my social media Hiatus, I had a friend send me an article that said social isolation kills and I was just like wow that's deep and hard but I am definitely still getting my social interaction just in a  Different more low-key way and and actually, you know what? It was really fulfilling like not being on social media like and having those human connections kind of replace these like fo connections that I thought were real human connections was like eye-opening in terms of just like how humans Thrive I have really been challenging myself to talk to strangers more and more, you know, kind of beefed up by the great conversations and connections. I had through lift, but also like just  Maybe some sunshine and people's lives like sometimes when you talk to someone at the grocery store you maybe be the only person that person is talk to you today. And I think it's awesome to just like give someone a compliment. I think Compliments are a free thing. You can do that make people feel awesome and I highly recommend complimenting on things that are non physical appearance related things like oh I like your shirt. Where did you get it right like something really specific about what you like about someone about how they are.  In the world or like, you know, I don't know whatever talk to strangers. It's not going to it's nobody ever died of awkward and like if I view up but that's the long and the short of that but I really started just like challenging myself to do new social things and that was really good and it was harder for me to like see my friends because I was working so much mostly like when I was working for left, I was like doing self care and working and that was it because like I had a better driving day if I'm  Agitated and I definitely never would feel comfortable driving people in a car unless I had a full night's sleep. So those are two like primary huge self-care things that they needed to do. So something I also did while I was on my social media Hiatus is I created a second Instagram account. That was just like a secret account that I used to consume just a very small number. I'm talking like 5 to 10 people on social media and the reason why I  Did that it's a weirdest thing. I started missing John Mayer. So John Mayer grammy-winning a recording artist. You probably have heard his stuff. He's very famous. He I got introduced to him because of Andy Cohen who's like the Bravo host the executive producer of The Real Housewives and Andy. I don't know. I just started watching Watch What Happens Live? I really liked him read his book superficial and I I just like really  Next John Mayer just based on how Andy talked about him. So then I started falling on him on social media and I actually like really deeply admire him as an artist like he has an amazing art practice. Like he's a brilliant guitar player really good songwriter and like deeply connected to emotions. I've also looked up his birth chart. So his Mars is in cancer if that means anything to you, but that means that your work in the world is about feelings. So Mars is your work.  what the sign of cancer is all about feels and so anyway, so he just has a really good Lyricist way of connecting to feelings and I yeah, I also like he's I think studied comedy or at least like has at least been a student of Comedy because he's very funny and like you can tell like he's like working in refining on that and any artist who learns like it's basically like an art hack right like a Mastery hack like when you've got an area of Mastery and you  Start exploring other artistic Expressions outside of that mean expression it it actually makes the main expression stronger. I think it's something to do with brain science. I read it in a book and so like anyway, and also if he's funny and he makes me laugh out loud and I specifically need more people in my life who make me laugh out loud, like I'm 40, like I don't have time to have a boring life anymore. Like I want mirth enjoyment and dad Joe.  Jokes, you know what I mean and like so I'm just I'm here for you. I'm here for people who make me laugh. And so then I just I enjoyed follow him on social media because he regularly makes me laugh out loud because I admire his artistic practice and enjoy a consuming his art. Like I'm now a big fan like it's funny because like his social media got me listening to his music more now, I love it and I just like found myself like in like month one of my social media Hiatus curious have John Mayer  You know what? I mean, and I'm like wow, this is interesting of all the people I follow on social media and it's like more than a thousand on my main account which is at Bevins party. If you don't follow me yet. I was like Wow John Mayer, huh? So like I just I'm also an artist who follows her Curiosities. I think Curiosities are the way God sort of leads us to things and so I decided I was like, okay if I'm curious about John Mayer, why don't I like you know, like  Go see what he's up to. So I logged into like my side account and just like followed him followed like a couple other entrepreneurs who like have what I want and like I said like you take advice from people who have the fruit on the tree that you want. And so I followed my leek teal who is an amazing boss CEO and just really good and resilient about what other people think she  Preaches a lot about being patient with the process and really just like her podcast is also Top Notch really recommend a follow to that. I also followed Gary Vee who is this prolific content creator. Once you see the amount of content, he has that every time I'm like, oh my God, he's putting out so much content. I remind myself. He is a 30-person Content creation team, which means he's like not effing around about creating content, but he preaches optimism and patients all the time which are  very crucial characteristics of any entrepreneur and I needed those reminders because like, you know, you don't have any control over like the market and how things go you only have control over your work product and it is your work product is very very dependent on your perspective and I really needed people to remind me to be optimistic and patient. And so I started following them. I started following like a couple of my close friends who have babies.  Is because like they're like minutes pass and they get bigger like it is so bananas when you like have kids in your life who are growing. I love being an aunt and I love connecting two kids and I really appreciate my friends who share their babes on social media so that I can see them grow up like kind of minute by minute. It's yeah, it's just like something I was really missing like seeing my little nieces and nephews and so I was like, I want to see them so I started end.  It up. I ended up like following like maybe 10 people but the best part about it was that my feed would end like you can scroll through and it's done. So if you only follow 10 people and I'm not saying like you have to get a whole new account for this you could dump everybody on yours and only follow 10 people, but I think it's super potent to be consuming everything someone's pumping out like because that's a person who has what you want and that's why you're connecting with them. And so it was great because like 15 minutes and that was it. So I was  And out in 15 minutes. It did not drag me down. It actually Amplified me and helped me feel better in life. And but also not consumed by her connected to social media too much and now that I'm back on social media. I oh and also one more thing I wanted to say about that. It's so you are truly influenced by The Five People You spend the most time with it really shapes who you are and I really curate who those people are in my life.  Life as soon as Darren I broke up. I worked really hard for her to drop out of that top five because she is so fear-based and like I knew that how much fear she had and like scarcity mentality. She had I knew that was affecting me and I knew it even while we were together, but I just loved her too much and I was too committed to our relationship to like critique that or try to take her out of my top five, right? I wouldn't marry someone who I wouldn't want my top 5, but now I see it and I'm like, oh  I like just needed to get that negativity out of my head and I needed to get that like worry some sort of stress ball stuff away from me. So I worked really hard to like curate my top 5 and who's influencing me and I think you can do that with people who you were not directly like in a relationship with right like they don't have they can be your friends. Like if you are like sitting around with one of your besties all the time, or like if you're a parent and you have  Current friends who are like friends of your kids that you don't really like that much but you're spending time with them because your kids are together like those people are affecting you but I think that if you put some time into it and intention into it, you can be influenced in a similar Way by people who are content creators or artists or whatever. I really got into consuming everything that one person would put out. Like if someone had a podcast I might just listen to that whole podcast or listen to them regularly.  Like every week so so Kyle sees is someone I very intentionally making my top five because he has what I want. He's happy. He's fulfilled. He's living a life of impact and he's financially I wouldn't call him financially independent, but he's pretty close like and so yeah, so like being part of his absolutely everything past community and being on his weekly calls, like that's just a way that he is like sowing into me his beliefs and perspective and allowing me to kind of  absorb that and and put it into practice in my life. And so yeah and like also like artists who you if you're an artist and you don't have artist whose practices you respect that you are trying to have in your top five. Like I you're not going to necessarily grow as an artist like you need people who are helping you grow if you want to grow in life, and if you don't want to grow in life life is just going to keep kicking your ass until you decide that growth is what you want from.  Actually, that's it's just my my wisdom and like, you know, sometimes you're not even noticing the life ask his ass kicking because you're just used to it like this is just how life is sometimes life kicks you in the ass most of the time this is where that 90/10 thing comes in. I really truly believe and this is Bevin having lived through a year where it was not 90/10. It does not have not had 90% He's and ten percent resistance. It has been kind of more of the other way around but you know, they in spiritual communities they call it.  The Dark Night of the Soul when you're really like having to grow through some stuff and I've had to grow through some stuff but I'm grateful to feel like it's on the other side because like just choose to believe that I don't have I don't have anything that I got a lot of packing I still gotta do get a lot of decluttering to do but I'm just believing for it. I'm trying to just be in that mindset that everything is happening for a reason and that I am you know  Be less depressed because I am focusing on human connection having at least like five real human connections every day. And yeah, like really just and that's going to be a challenge living rurally and like I'm glad that I had the practice of a social media Hiatus so that I can know what it's like for me to like change radically how we interact with humans and also just have that data about me that having five kids.  Connections in a day really does help me stay a little antidepressant right? And you know, since I've been back on social media, I think I've been back for like a month and a half. I still mostly consumed. My phaedo cardi B also isn't made it into those 10 people because I love cardi B. She's an amazing artist. I really loved her perspective in life and she teaches a lot about how to be resilient to haters. So anyway, I have still consumed.  Feed but I'm also still can I'm also consuming on my main feed again and I just love social media. It's hard for me not to do it. And so I have to really like monitor my time and not get stuck in the black hole of it. But you know, I'm chatting. I like it anyway, so I hope any of this helps like I hope that any of my experience is resonating with you and that you are out there thriving yourself and out there figuring out where your next area for growth is.  And you know I share this stuff because it's helpful for me to hear other people's experience and I frankly want to double dip. I will if I might find one I have to go through some shit and hurt and pain and resistance and all of that. I want the double dip of not only learning from it, but sharing it and like having this be for more than just like the pain I had to experience. I really want to help other people experience a glow up and have a great life. I'm really  It's like when it comes to social media and stuff like as a quote-unquote influencer, I'm really not interested in followers. What I'm interested in is leaders people who are out there who want to lead you have to start by Leading yourself, right? Like so who want to lead in their lives, but then also like leave whether or not it's like in a formal capacity by taking on leadership roles or if it's just informally like in your life providing an example of someone who does Growth work grows in life is more kind trying.  To do better things in the world, you know, like you just don't know who you have an influence on who you have an impact on in your life and I frankly don't think follower counts have anything to do with worthiness. I think in fact, sometimes they can mask a lot of things but I'm really out here just like looking for leaders people who like want me to help incubate their self-care, you know, that's a that's my ultimate goal for my patreon is like to have leaders who, you know want to have a movement practice with me. I think it's super meaningful.  The shop for your body and for yourself at least once a week to like have some intentional movement practice and I always try to like download nuggets and I think it's really powerful to have, you know, lessons and bigger philosophies coming into movement class other than like having to get some aspirational body. Right? Like I'm here for aspirational like life and empowerment and fun and enjoy an impact.  So anyway, that's my philosophy about that. I hope that wherever you are, you know that you are worthy of Love exactly as you are. You're amazing. You are an inspiration to many and you have no idea or maybe you do and I just like really appreciate you tuning in. I really appreciate you, you know being here wanting more for your life and and just like take a little time to dream like take a little time to think about like what's on your heart.  What's your next big thing? And like why do you want to make an impact on the world? Just think about those things? I think so few people even spend time dreaming up what their life can be like and you're never going to get there. If you don't even think of it, you know what I mean? Like, I think like a lot of us just kind of like let life, you know sort of push us around and like end up places without really like consciously like considering like what can it look like or what what's possible for?  Or me and like the more time every day that I spend just like in the possibilities that's available the more I'm able to connect into. Oh, that's so that's kind of a calling or that's something that's really speaking to me or oh, I love that idea for later. Maybe but maybe not. I'm not going to work on that right now, right? Whatever. Anyway spend some time dreaming. I've been signing off for forever. I'm going to cut this off, but I want to like play out with little John Mayer his most recent at-bat Carry Me Away. I  I love an artist whose favorite like who's just constantly turning out something amazing and like it's his latest song is so far my favorite John Mayer song. So you're only as good as your last at-bat. I learned that from Gary V. And here's John Mayer's latest at bat. Love you all. I'm such a boy. I'm such a girl.  Bummer there must be more behind the summer. I want someone to make some trouble been with you say inside my bubble take me out and keep me up on that.  Carry me. Carry me.   Scanning can I have some more? I can't understand it you fast car you foolish spender, you know you are and I Surrender come on and wake me up. That's kind of crazy.  Carry Me  	I'm making Big Life Changes and walk through my mindset around them.  I also talk through lessons learned from a four month social media hiatus and how it helped me strategically approach how I connect to content creators online.  
spotify:episode:1fxJlUb1i2oOWmxarKGXDz	Bookstores got fucked. Yes called Amazon you like if you owned a lot of fucking Limoges, you know, you got fucked. It was called Uber. Yeah, the music industry got confused because it looked like they got fucked with Napster and all that other shit, but it wasn't time yet. There's too many other ancillary things that they were able to control but it's starting to get real interesting. There's they realize that that's the yeah. They're so ugly. Look, they could read yours, you know stuff they go on to way to the 15 biggest NBA superstars realized they're getting fucked. Yeah. Oh, whoa now they don't want it now. Yeah I'm talking about could you imagine you woke up tomorrow? And you heard that LeBron Steph Durant and Giannis and Westbrook have left the league are now 50/50 partners with a billionaire and I've started the world basketball league and we have a draft of the month. I believe it's going to happen. Oh, yeah.  It became too top-heavy. Yeah, I don't watch football for Patrick Mahomes and Tom Brady but basketball is 13 guys. Yeah, they're still not getting the Lion's Share of the profits any well, they're doing things literally literally the top 20 players could own 50% of a team tomorrow with a willing billionaire. Yeah.  Basil's is one of them and it's airing on Amazon Prime. So wrap. Yeah, but they don't like the prom with the American Football League is they don't have stars. Right? Like if we like again if we all wake up and LeBrons like yo, I'm partners with sucks, you know, it's game over like, you know, if I don't think that's possible in baseball hockey or even football you care more about too many variables bath. It's just it's just it's just too many variables but 20 basketball players.  Have 80% of the leverage. Yeah and do it, right it was good. It's your boy Juicy J. I hope you're enjoying the podcast with my sit down with Gary Instagram. Huh? Everyone's freaking out. I loved it. I'm laughing so hard from down all day. Yeah the down all day and everybody's it's been really nice for me because I've been yelling at everybody to diversify their platforms. So you got people  1.7 million followers on Instagram and 307 on Twitter and everyone's on Twitter right now. They sure are how you been I've been great man has been blessed me. You had a baby this year congrats my mom maybe last year, but she just turned one this year congrats. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, so I just that's my first one. That's my just doing my daddy duties and stuff like that. So I'm glad we finally make able to make this happen. Hmm.  He was talking. I mean he is so much going on all over the place. We were talking about everything like that because you think about it from a label perspective or collaboration perspective or business perspective. Yeah, we can definitely do some like that. You know, if you're interested like is so many that's what I want to do something artists. They don't they want to have like a lot of labels try to turn the artist into what they want. They see God is could be but I'm like more like, you know ours development left.  Just be themselves, you know, you know, maybe getting some ownership if possible, you know stuff like that. Just try to make you know, because I feel like the artist makes the label so you need to treat this though. I think the label should start treating artist, you know, we're living more respect like going to they're going to be forced to because unlike the world I grew up in the labels will continuously lose leverage because things like SoundCloud and YouTube and Spotify didn't exist. The internet's the middleman. Yeah until people realize that they're going to be bone.  Durable, so this is the greatest era to be an artist and it's going to get better and better and better. Yeah, because you can own the audience, right? I mean, yeah good evening yourself. I mean when I think about actually I think no internet. I couldn't even imagine what hip-hop would look like no internet the evolutions and all the nuances to the space. It allowed artist to be artists some of these cats that came up SoundCloud would have never been able to do this shit. They did no labeled of let them do any of that shit.  Putting on some of that SoundCloud shit on fucking MTV exactly right away you grew up in the music business on. Yeah, so, you know about, you know, the distribution you still have all the leverage right? And now every day that goes by it has less Mmm Yeah Yeah, I was doing my stuff myself. And you know, I was fortunate to have a when I get with Sony records. They have like a subsidiary like relativity.  It's yeah the ground black but they was let they let us do our own thing. They was like not even trying to change y'all do what y'all want to do. Y'all music is be the way I want to do it. I promoted how y'all want to promote it seemed like that. We've seen like like 200,000 copies Gold Records on Independent. You know, I'm saying making like that CDs who's making like $14 a CD, you know saying and you know, even the Mad phone 500,000 copies in time soundscan 14, that's a lot of money. So they knew who they saw us doing that so there's like, maybe I'll just keep doing what you're doing and we ain't gonna try to make y'all go pee.  But Ernie onto crossover artist y'all on the ground stake on the ground.  And then we just kept going out doing doing I think doing that thing and it got bigger and bigger and bigger. So I'd never try to take control at all. They will say y'all make the never give us the money. I make the music smart. We produced all the music. We wrote all the songs smart, you know, if we promoted it ourselves only thing they did was just put it out and sounds like my book deals. I said lots and lots of books don't worry Collins makes lots lots of money and they don't bother me at all. Yeah, that's right. That's like when you're in distribution, that's the get out of the way of the people.  That know yep. Yep. That's it. Unfortunately like that's hard to do. You got to find the right ones and that whole game now the platforms are out of the way. They're not human beings. There's no Sandy Spotify. Yeah. YouTube is not a human. Yeah. You're right. What's so bits so game-changing. It's why it's so fun. It's why there's so much good art. It's why it's so I was I was walking the other day in the mall. And then the Maltese Chris. I just called the airport the mall.  I was called I was in the airport and I'm just looking at everybody and I'm like man. We are finally in a plate like everybody looked different. Mmm, right? Yeah, like I was just thinking back to like the way I grew up like hip-hop culture. Everybody wore timbo's everybody wore fucking yeah that timbo's g baggy jeans like yeah. That was exactly the same. Yeah. Now you're about to sound the same, but that musically that's that's technology. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  But I was looking I'm like just everyone's different. Yeah, they got this weird color hair, you know about it like dig it, you know ya love and just like everyone's doing a hundred different things. Yeah that Mos Def and like everything Place. Mmm. That's what the internet did. Yeah the internet open the doors people now want to see more of you know, like they like the music but they want to see what's you know, what like I like Instagram like what is he doing all day a hundred percent? Yeah. Well, he's hanging out with his mom and I was kids. Are you hanging out smoking dope whatever you want to see.  What you want to do that we sit in traffic. It's because people want to watch other people if there's an accident we're looking.  Your nose is fuck and if you got something like interesting like you got some weird color hair or some crazy gold teeth for some time in first because then everybody else does it then it's not different anymore. True true true. And then then what then what ends up happening is my favorite part who's a one-trick pony and who's not hmm. That's the new game. Like, I think everybody's gonna get their 15 minutes of fame. Yes, the amount of people that are going to get 15 minutes of fame. It exists. Everybody's got followers.  Now think about life in followers. Mmm rikes like followers likes everybody's famous. True who first can pop from the field. But the real game is when you pop and then everybody else puts face tattoos on their face. Do you have a second move? Yeah. Can you be Madonna was Madonna? Yeah. That's why Lady Gaga's doing her thing if you have real talent. Yeah. I've been doing it for 30 years.  It's crazy. Is that right? Yep 30 and I'm old as fuck.  Yep started with Three 6 Mafia tonight, you know doing my solo thing still been rolling.  30 years won Academy Award or a little song for a movie. I Remember You know that was some crazy. Huh man blessing me has been its neighborhood must have liked that one. Oh, yeah, they went crazy. It may seem like a people still congratulate me today. I was at I just left I went to the Oscars this time. There was a Layman grave. I like man. It's like 10 years ago like man, you still shining with it though, man. I probably wear that shit around my neck. If I had one I secured everywhere. Is that the house? I scared everybody would be really bars. I got it. So I  Free food with that night. I wanted a guy gave me a Christian Academy Award like in hand back in the day. That's like having 15 million Instagram followers. That is real Flex that's still flexes. They were talking about the Monday to Monday playlist. They're kind of a little key. We're talking about sighs Sosa like this is gonna be so big exactly in like their like on the same way that you know, I mean some up so you see what you think about it Jerry think about it from a standpoint of like  being smart about collaborations that really like completely penetrate you into the state of the moment or action like signing these kids like how you think about it personally? Well, I got to do a lot of flexibility. You can go about in a minute bunch of different ways. Yeah. I gotta do on a table right now with Colombia and we haven't signed it yet. And I love Columbia. I've been with them like pretty much all my life. Yes. It was since I was 23 I sounded deal when I was like 23, so I've been on the Columbia. It's the whole song even family, but you know, I got a deal on the table right now.  Want me to maybe do to me president over there so still negotiating, but I know my way of options, you know, I'm saying like my thing is like let's I want to do something different like stir the music game of guitars development, you know pay attention to the Arts a little bit more, you know, maybe it'll give him a little bit ownership stuff like that and and ideas and you know, just kind of embrace the artists because the artist is the what makes the company have you thought about other businesses. Like how do you guys think about leveraging the brand and leverage and the iconic nature and like whether it's fashion or events?  It's or alcohol or bubblegum weed. Yeah cannabis system. I'm very aware. You guys are doing with us. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Yes. I'm super happy about that. That's gonna work. Yeah. I've been yeah, I've been keeping a close eye on it. Yeah. I'm a big I'm a big we'd head. So, you know that weed is definitely I mean, that's it. That's that's a given, you know, we can do that all day, you know saying please break it down for me.  The screw you're filming your creative device love it use your system. It's awesome lot on managing for a long time. Thank you. I appreciate it. I'm trying my guy. I'm trying.  When we sort of business was a rock and roll up first rock wrong have somebody talk to me man. She was sober big talk to me. So 74 you got into it just for my own. This is where I mean, I think history tells the  My biggest hot take on the whole SoundCloud little pump. All that shit is that it's rap at the maturity that rock and roll was when punk rock started Mmm Yeah. It's like right like I hear Jesus say never fight establishment. Like fuck you Jake. Oh, like what? That's what they fucking did the Rolling Stones like, you know since shit mmm same shit. So since you were in the game right around right you start in 74 she got white hot with  Unk in New York like 78 79 night, right? Okay. Yep. And what was what was your what was everyone's take on it? It was here the kids were liking it because we're loving it and The Clash all that shit right here. There were scared scared of station wagon, they were afraid and all of a sudden.  And mainstream like everything else like rap at the time of course was underground. And of course. Mmm rap has rap hip hop has become worldwide cultural. Yes. It's got a has gone Way Beyond because of the social because of the ability to reach the planet in five seconds. You put up one of your post is a reading about it in Belarus hundred percent. So it's maybe not Belarus because that fuckers a dictator and doesn't let them know.  The internet but for sure that's you know, I think that's where we're such interesting timing because the music landscape changed so much because of MTV like it's crazy. I actually think the most I do a lot of history unlike culture. I actually think like social networks. Most remind me of what I'm TV to like mte change the landscape people didn't want to make videos for MTV the original bands.  Because they thought it was free music. Yes. It's like make it like mixtapes, right? Yeah, like like I remember when you came we really started looking and I remember being so fast and all that mixtape stuff we were doing and I remember just being fascinated as a businessman. I'm like are these artists and labels smart enough to understand how important mix tapes were and at the time back in know eight seven five six. There was still like a rub right like a mixtape when you're signed. It's so much more accepted now.  Yeah, because the macro like labels understand the promotional value, so I remember a long time ago. That's exactly right. Yeah. I remember when I started doing my mixtapes Columbia used to be days to call my phone stopped putting out free music. Stop putting out free music all of a sudden. I got a hit record Bands To Make It dance it blew up and then it was on a mixtape and then they call didn't even know that I would sign with them. They had got like new Staff feel like would you sign with us? Yeah, I'm dying with you. That's what happened just like that. I  If and I was like y'all crazy as hell is my lighter same way. I think about content on social all my shits free. Yeah, and everybody else is trying to get you into a funnel to buy like a by some sort. Of course. Well, that's what YouTube has become just a commercial. It's just like on a supermarket now nothing is adventurous there because they shut it down because of Unilever somebody like that saying no no. No, you can't do it. Yep. He's experiencing a talk about it.  We're seeing that YouTube is stopping their traction there also stop and also stop. I mean look what you like. Listen follow the money. It's when headlines come out that's a ads are running on point of a pedophile content and they don't have the tech to shut down pedophiles, but not something adventurous. They have to go one day of the make a decision and what they're doing now inevitably.  Cuz I understand Google well enough is all they're trying to do is get their Tech good enough. They're thrilled for adventurous. They're scared fuckless when Unilever or McDonald's or Coca-Cola pull all ads until you prove to me that my ad won't show up on a pedophile. Tell me their horses in New York at the time when I was getting ready to do their cable.  Their cable license and she came out and said hip hop is horrible. It's horrible for society blah blah blah that Forest Time Warner or memory that story so that's how Universal wind up getting because she put up such a thing one woman and whatever her crew was they put up such a thing in New York and The Time Warner license with a cable was much more important than I remember that I saw that in a doctor per board. That's one tip for got it.  It was the same thing. We have ever done an artist at the end the rating on the package. I remember it's our new touring The Adventurous artist because I started getting frayed the record company. Yes, the problem of the not the problem. The amazing part of the world is internet. Yeah, show me, you know, just, you know, kind of going full circle to what we're talking about is you know, what what were hopefully going to be doing soon with the other situation.  Want to fuck up music business really disrupt disrupt disrupt the music business and away. Are you able to in the framework of that with that? It'll help I'll help but I'm saying that within this when you say, you know, what can we do that kind of situation as the world is ready for it and you'll appreciate this. I think you everybody here knows it it already happened true. Like right now it's about now it's riding the wave right this second.  Some kid in Toronto 16 years old literally just now recorded some shit on free software put it on Soundcloud and in 43 weeks. All of us are gonna be like yo, that's he's next. Yeah, right. Yeah. Yeah, they still waiting for their stats. If they don't have the Staffing biggest probably the biggest probably have is their big artists are just not as big as they used to be not because Katy Perry or Taylor Swift or Jay-Z  Are not big they're huge. It's just everyone's amortized. There's a long tail every listen that Killy gets is a listen that Jay-Z doesn't they're not moving quick enough. They're not they don't have the economic rationale for it. They're not signing the suicide boys that had signing these younger artists that are coming to Juicy's door every day every week saying all the time out of that because of the you guys discussed.  Ahjussi data try to know how his own hands. So the goat that he is calling to go he was what happens when you been in the fucking game for 30 years. That is Major old as fuck is what he does. So he's like look, I've noticed that there's no artist development anymore really and things of this nature. You know, what tech that  his nickname Tech create a CRM of some kind of funnel so I can you say hey you got music you got this on my Instagram go to Juicy. What is it Juicy J Talent search at gmail.com and two days 12,000 emails came under percent Non-Stop and they listening 90% of shit. But only 8 percent shit. Well words, I guess what one to say one. That's all you need. Who is that?  I found Justin Bieber on YouTube. There was a lot of shit on their search it thats that's it. So what's happening is that he and there's a less artist. I'm gonna put him on blast but that come to him like in our studio sessions and I'll just pull up like juicy and you know, what's going on beat why they need a sound I need this what's hot because he's in this. Listen, you're either close to the street or you're not yeah. It's not super complicated to Binary game. Yeah. Yeah right would help him out with a deals to maybe like man you how much Publishers I'll be getting off this summer.  That's right. You know, it's funny. I I say a lot and I was hearing obviously you've heard like I always say it's either information or It's Entertainment. Mmm. And if you can do both and you can be a goat, so we're at this point where it's like, okay, how do we get these artists on board and nurture him and you know gloma put them in certain areas where they can blow up. This is, you know, this is inevitable like Steve Stoute with his mom.  All the platforms are doing it naturally themselves. The kids are so into entrepreneurship. They're like fuck it. I'll just do it myself like the internet what like I laugh. I'm like Ubers not bamas, like bookstores got fucked. It's called Amazon you like if you owned a lot of fucking Limoges, you know, you got fucked. It was called Uber. Yeah, the music industry got confused because it looked like they got fucked with Napster and all that other shit, but it wasn't time yet.  There's too many other ancillary things that they were able to control but it's starting to get real interesting the herbs. They realize that that's it. Yeah NBA superstars realized they're getting fucked. Yeah. Well, they don't want it now. Yeah I'm talking about. Could you imagine you woke up tomorrow? And you heard that LeBron Steph Durant and  Be honest and Westbrook have left the league are now 50/50 partners with a billionaire and I'm started the world basketball league and we have a draft of the month. I believe it's going to happen. Oh, yeah, we watch it became too top-heavy. Yeah. I don't watch football for Patrick Mahomes and Tom Brady but basketball is 13 guys. Yeah. Hmm. They're still not getting the Lion's Share of the profits any well, they're doing things literally literally.  Only the top 20 players could own 50% of a team tomorrow with a willing billionaire. Yeah.  Basil's is one of them and it's airing on Amazon Prime. So wrap. Yeah, but they don't like the problem with the American Football League is they don't have stars. Right? Like if we like again if we all wake up and LeBrons like yo, I'm partners with sucks. You know, it's game over like yeah, you know if and I don't think that's possible in baseball hockey or even football you care more about too many variables bath. It's just it just to it's just too many variables but 20 basketball players.  Have 80% of the leverage. Yeah, you do it right. I'm shocked you out did that oversees already like the overseas? Well, there was a little bit of like you see a little bit of it with like the soccer players that are very similar spot. There's 20 of them that run shit. That's just a global 365 days a year. It's so fragmented to begin with between their tournaments and leagues and the you know, I don't know the NBA players are getting smarter and smarter by the second. They don't shorter contracts. I noticed a lot of NBA players the amount of shorter contracts because they have what  But what really gets interesting is TV deals.  So we have a sports agency my brother and I am were paying attention more to when the collective bargaining agreement comes up and they'll strike or not strike or they'll be a lockout and not but at the end result when the TV contracts come up its what happened the NBA when the TB money massively increased that's why we all freaked out when average players were getting big-ass numbers for like six men. Uh-huh, and that's because that's because there's only  Can 15 guys you got it? I don't got to pay 12 15 guys and all that money. It's got to go somewhere. Yeah. Yeah. NBA players got paid. Yeah. They did. They deserve it man. We watch that shit all day every day.  Yeah, I'm going to sell hoodies on Shopify. Yeah, that's what happened to me. I was just living my life. I got caught up in like the macro. It's not like I masterminded entrepreneurship got big. I just happen to be there. Honestly, right just like athletes these you got six men in the NBA who are going  More money this year than dr. Jay made in his career timing. I'm just running businesses. I wasn't thinking about like cool people are going to fucking think. I was cool. Get the fuck out of here, right? It's just timing Yep. This is the same things. They got trapped in these 360 deals a hundred percent artists a hundred percent, but look artist took the fucking check. Yeah that 360 deal sound exciting wait for TV and stage and Live Events and maybe I won't  And even do that many and I'll fucking cash it. I'll fucking bullshit that appearance. I'm supposed to be here three years. I'm not working. I showed up for 40 minutes. I'm a rap get the fuck out of here. Like right listen. Don't take the chat. Well, that's the reason why these longevity a hundred percent of is that a hundred percent discount plus honestly my favorite part Talent. Yeah Talent from he's my favorite like it's really it's not easy to write the first great book to write to have the first great album, but you just live your  Whole life if you're especially if you write for that first album, it's your life and write it. You have your whole life and you write it and it pops because it's true. It's you and if you're a good writer if you have if you're a good writer, if you can really story tell you can paint a picture. It's your unique pick when Eminem starts talking about being white trash for the mom like that that resonate with a whole genre of nobody will ever talk like that. The problem is what do you do next? It's funny.  I remember the Jay-Z like song Ray talks about like fucking against like really expensive paintings. Yeah, and I remember thinking how smart that was because I remember thinking how like just like that's what he should be doing. No, it's not going to rent like most people don't fuck the hottest girl in the world Hannah 80 million dollar fucking painting. Yeah, but it's better to tell your truth. Otherwise not cut saying anything. Yeah, that's where he's at. Yeah. Yeah people by her.  They love the girl with you know, I'm saying because nobody will stay the same. It's always relevant always matters. So one of the biggest reasons Jay-Z doesn't have as much of a youthful audience is that Delta is enormous, you're 15 in the hood. You can't even be thinking about 80 million dollar paintings. So you're going to fuck with baby, you know? Yeah exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, but for the people that are 43 and 44, maybe em, you're not in the millions, but maybe when you started listening to who've you were fucking work at McDonald's  maybe now you make you know, even if you're making 40 or a hundred k at least you're grown up. Yeah, we should know what a painting is. Yeah, and that's been so I've been thinking a lot about just speaking your truth. Like when I think about why does my content work? I only talk about what's actually happening. You know, this is my fucking tea Grizzly, right? This is why I betting long Auntie Grizzly. That was it. Like he's like, you said something like we're in studio and he said something degree of like, you know, I just only write about what I actually lived.  I remember looking at me like if you do that in perpetuity, you got something the story is real from call. Yeah, he's got his he and George. Yeah, he's got his real story. But again, everybody's got that struggle then they get paid their identity was the struggle in the hood, but now they're living in the suburbs of Bergen County.  And they're scared to go there and I'm telling like go there talk about the feeling that you felt when you bought your mama house. Tell that whole story. Tell the whole story. Mmm.  The truth is where I guess the punchline of my little rant here. Well, those funny juicy tells us all the time. He was like, you know, you got in La he had to get out. Yeah. Yeah when I was when I came here, I was you know after he won an Academy Award bought a house here. I'll just follow, you know ball and coordinated. How old were you I was like 30 and 31. I was you were finished, you know a living that's going crazy. Then all of a sudden I just felt like, you know the show start going down a little bit, you know.  Phone ringing that's much and my brother was asking me my brother will come out here from Memphis you like what y'all doing man? What y'all doing? Y'all bull has fallen off a I got to get in the studio and make some more music and I was like man you right man, so I sold my house and just and I always had a house in Memphis. I just went back to Memphis and started just doing the same things. I was doing back when I was starts grinding like the can't believe you just said that you and I see why you're shaking head Caleb. I've been saying for the last six months a lot randomly and shit like this.  I don't understand how people understand that the thing that you fucking did to get you. There is the thing that gets you to the next level, but people think once you get to a level now, you got to change it. Yeah, I think that's when you got a double down on it, especially in hip-hop music. They own the streets are the only thing that that's the currency that will do the same street corners are hung up with the same people may want to the hood shot videos and just soak up all that energy and I was like man, this is what I've been especially you put it through the filter of new shit you saw in ela you mix it a little you take  People go a hundred from the street then they go to La and it's a hundred and I think the game for me is a hundred on the street. Now you go to La and you live it your the different life when you go back to the street, you take 80 of that mmm, but you mix it with 20 of the new shit then that's what I did. I came back to LA and I was like, man whenever I felt like I lost someone that was going back to Memphis and I said, I'm going to go back to LA and I feel like I'm losing them when I touch down in the back in the city and Los Angeles, I would never listen to the radio. I feel like the red  so really missing my head up because I like the music is different, you know, maybe it's really just the visual. I just had was like eat caviar with a 40, you know what I mean? Right mix of course.  You ready for this is a single reason. I'm winning on social. I still post every post. I write every comment.  I'm in the trenches. I'm in my craft. That's me. Yeah. Yeah the big man. That's why doubling down on LinkedIn.  And like that's the corniest like that doesn't seem right. But when you're in the trenches, you know, it's right. You're not worried about that. Mmm. You know what I'm really fascinated by with you specifically and just like, you know, like like something just happened that really like works for me the Jonas Brothers. I think once you build a brand and your iconic, you're always in play Until the End.  Yep, you just have to be contemporary. Yeah, just one number one film back. It's just there's so much pent-up actual fandom. What are you doing Tour on this? Probably, you know many people listening to the audio of this probably right now in three weeks as a podcast smiled when you said Three 6 Mafia because you smile to a place you like I did it you like I would literally thought about moose and I thought about like dumb shit we were doing you know, like  It takes you to a place. Do you owe me 40 year old women that heard the Jonas Brothers rebooted lost their damn Minds? Yes, because they thought back to her twenty thirty five thirty, you know, like those songs came back. They was at those concerts. Like wow, I remember that. I'm gonna that's what any consequence it's what Vegas does now based on that DNA once you get to that icon place like,  Are and Celine Dion and hurt us? Yeah always have always have bands but if you could but where I think it's real interesting is you always have fans but like to me it was the Tony Bennett Lady Gaga thing. Okay, it's because it's what it's what it's why I like want you to do a song with keyed. Like there's such an equal trade. I think an established icon rapper and a up-and-coming SoundCloud rapper. The trade is similar to like  and you know, I always think about them as like the little bit older guy with the younger lady. There's a train going on there. You understand. Yeah. Both parties are winning. Yes different agendas. Yeah, you understand. Yeah, like, you know getting schooled on the game having a mentor. Yeah. Look when that song comes out and all those 14 year olds, like who's that? Because they don't know. Yeah people take it for granted, but they don't mmm, I'm very hot on high low, and then I'm into genre mix  I was telling nip so I didn't see the other day. I was like motherfucker listen to Kpop listen to country and he's like but it's not authentic. I'm like no no listened. And if you hear something that you're like yo, that was fresh. Then you do a little Googling. Let me call them and be like yo, bro in South the South Korea what you about how you grew up with a struggle. Are you my guy if you're in La come through and then all of a sudden and then it becomes authentic and then you come out with a Nipsey Hussle K-Pop song and next thing, you know you're in for  Asia making four million - oh, yeah, that's that's I mean, I wish I had musical skills. I'd be the number one artist in the world my but I genuinely believe it. Look what I'm doing reversing. Your Instagram is the culture that I don't know cause I did it. I just did a country song with artists make the beat and everything. Well, I'd actually co-produced it because you're not in it. Yeah, I want you to be in it as a as a Lyricist. I want you to be on a song with fucking Blake Shelton.  I like breaking culture like that. Yeah, that would work. That's how you win. I'm telling you right now. Go look at the math the way I look at it Kendrick Lamar and Taylor Swift song what that did for Kendrick people don't understand at scale and leverage. It was a dope idea and when you're a great artist you can get away with it all day long. People are scared like, oh, I don't want to sell other something.  You're not thinking hey when I did it something I did this song like, you know, I got a song with Katy Perry when I did that song it was right today. I still perform this on they go crazy crazy. Yeah crazy. Yes, I would steal ya crazy. That's exactly what I'm talking about. Yeah, he was he was early with young nudie like before knew. He was really popping at all. He was on duties mixtape, like my biggest thing is I just want to bring value and then my main goal in life is to bring more value to every relationship.  Ship that they bring to me and then never have to call in that variable.  I like knowing it exists. I really love what people that I bring value to say behind my back and then my hope is that I don't fuck up enough for nothing tragic happens where I'd actually need those chips. I'm trying to put chips. I know they're there and by the way the best part I know that I put in ships and this is already have in my life. I put in chips I go to take a couple out and they don't have them for me. For some reason. It doesn't fuck with me.  When you give without expectation truly not you're smart and you're giving and in four years. You're like, okay when he's a superstar, you know when you actually just give because you just thinking the macro somebody's watching.   Then you can really live happy. That's why I'm so happy. Like I know I have the leverage and I know if the person doesn't pay back on what I did, right it doesn't you know, what's even funny it isn't even like fuck them. It's just like it. You said it right? That's why that's why jump that it's like maybe some shits fucked up with them at that moment. They fucked it like, you know, like I just generally believed that people have to worry about them slick. I like humans default into that. I'm okay with that. I'm empathetic.

I was not at home, but in a bed-and-breakfast suite called the William Winter room at the Myrtle's plantation, the staff had shown me nothing short of southern hospitality yet in that moment. I felt like an unwelcome visitor.  A strange sensation came over me. I sat up in bed and surveyed the darkroom a gust of wind swept through the open window. It was freezing even though it was a humid summer night in Louisiana. I walked to the window before I shut it I peered outside the live oak trees rustled and the moon cast a majestic glow on the  It was the picture of tranquility and I felt at ease again.  Then I heard a shot. I froze it pierced the night and rang in my ears.  There was no screaming.  no voices  No sound but someone was hurt downstairs, and they needed help. I was sure of it. I slowly opened my bedroom door and crept down the hallway help me help me a man said my blood turn cold as I debated whether I should go downstairs, please help me anyone he pleaded.  I descended the stairs my adrenaline through the roof. I surveyed the entrance hall. There was no one in sight. No blood. No wounded man. No one I stood there with sweat dripping down my face and my heart pounding out of my chest.  Then I noticed the Moonlight pick up something on the floor.  Muddy Footprints trailed from the door up the staircase where they stopped Midway. I followed the footsteps until my eyes fell upon a wall mirror in it. I saw a man lying on the stairs with a gunshot wound in his chest. He was barely alive trying desperately to climb the staircase my head swung around.  No one was there.  And yet the footsteps kept ringing on the empty stairs as though prepared to do so.  for eternity  Welcome to haunted places. I'm Greg Polson every Thursday. I take you to the scariest eeriest most haunted real places on Earth this week. Join me on a supernatural journey to one of the most haunted homes in America. The Myrtle's plantation located in st. Francisville, Louisiana.  to this day  It's haunted.  If you can't get enough haunted places, don't forget to subscribe. You can find us on your favorite podcast directory as well as on Facebook and Instagram at par cast and on Twitter at par cast network if you like what you hear, we'd really appreciate a five star review wherever you're listening.  People have traveled from all over the country to st. Francisville Louisiana to visit the Myrtle's plantation. The Antebellum era Plantation is replete with a rich albeit complicated history that dates back to the late 18th century. It's now a bed-and-breakfast that attracts visitors in search of ghosts of the Antebellum South  General David Bradford who had a role in the Pennsylvania Whiskey Rebellion built the plantation in 1796 and named it Laurel Grove. He constructed a beautiful mansion on the six hundred and fifty acre plot complete with six Dormers and three Bays the interior boasted Sleek marble floors and arched Mantle's of the Rococo Revival a style that a pip.  Mised European Grandeur and luxury.  After Bradford died in 1808 his wife ran the property until she sold it to their son-in-law George Clark Woodruff judge. Woodruff was not a good man.  Though I knew it troubled her. I still chastise Chloe for her behavior. She was putting us all at risk what would happen if the judges sweet wife Sarah found out I will always remember the way she looked at me the Steely resolve her tents eyes flashing between anger and pain. What choice do I have?  I listened outside their door as I cleaned. I heard pain. I touched her I cursed her for putting us at risk, but she was right.  What choice did she have after all it was better than being in the fields in that sweating Delirious son day after day with aching bones and a noxious mind then one day the master called. I entered his Chambers and there sat Chloe her face frazzled her clothes torn, but crude cloth gag shoved in her mouth, but her eyes.  Her dark eyes ra Steely and fixed anger and pain.  The judge looked calm in a furious and focused way. He was shirtless suspenders hanging down to his knees his hairy chest protruded triumphantly the large knife in his hand danced across the Whetstone with the practiced patience.  Your friend he was saying to me has let me down. She's decided that the special treatment I give her is worth crying over his voice was low and rumbling. He looked at me with a cold gaze.  You don't want to let me down. Do you?  I shook my head with short and terse movements good.  He made me hold the rag under her ear. Not a drop of blood is to touch the floor of my Chambers. He commanded.  The knife went in with a surprising ease. I dared not look and Chloe sighs. I filled one ride with blood then another then I held the folds of my white dress against the terrible hole where her ear used to be I held it there as she screamed, but I did not spill a drop after all.  What choice did I have?  Chloe now wore a green turban to cover her wound. No one asked her about it. No one asked us anything anymore not even about the blood stains on my dress.  She still took care of the children, but now her Smiles with them were fake and distant.  What I saw her make the cake. I knew something was amiss I could have stopped her. I could have spilled the bowl or told the judge, but I did not.  She met my gaze as the waiting to see what I would do challenging me to challenge her I swallowed and looked away.  I watched her serve the cake to the judges wife Sarah and her two daughters. Nothing about Chloe smile then was fake.  Sarah and the children died quickly, they suffered little to Chloe. They were innocent. It was the living that must suffer.  The judge became enraged and unpredictable. I brought him whiskey after whiskey and watched him destroy his property piece by piece. He made me sit and drink with him. My head felt light he played with the blood stain on my dress running it between his fingers until he fell asleep in his chair. Then I heard the whispers.  They seem to dance through the hallway the sound of pain. I dashed through the hallway, but the Whispers seemed only to grow louder. You must find us. They said you must you must what choice do you have?  Then there was the mirror between its luxurious gold trim. The glass was foggy in a translucent way. I had cleaned it that day. I cleaned it every day. How could it be fogged up again? I could hardly see myself. My flat dark eyes were sucked in by the fog children. I was spurred.  A small hand struck the glass from inside the arm disappeared somewhere behind the fog. I did not jump or look away as the greasy desperate fingers streaked down the mirror after I still cleaned the mirror everyday, but I left the streak of small fingers there. The judge was too drunk to notice the crime, but they were an important reminder to me.  The which had cursed them curse the poor innocent children. She must be punished.  I told the other slaves I told them what Chloe had done. I told them that they would be blamed and we would all be punished they listened and nodded and grew angry the mob gathered Chloe from her quarters in the night. She did not fight them even when they strung the Noose around her neck. She did not fight.  They held her Loft for just a moment rope slung over the tree her eyes met mine.  There was no more pain no more anger only judgment.  What choice did I have I shouted crazed and Afraid. What choice do we have? They all looked at me?  Then they dropped her.  After Chloe died. They tied rocks to her body and threw her in the river. I walked out to its Bank every day, but her green turban never washed ashore.   Legend has it that a slave girl named Chloe sought revenge on judge Clark Woodruff after he ended an intimate relationship with her he cut off her ear. So she murdered mrs. Woodruff and the children by poisoning their food.  Some believe Khloe wanted to kill them While others hold that she only intended to make the family sick, so she could nurse them back to health in order to gain Clark woodruff's approval again.  The Story Goes that Chloe met her fate at the hands of the other slaves who were afraid Woodruff would also punish them for her deed  There's no evidence to support any of these theories or that Chloe even existed at all historical records indicate that woodruff's wife and children died from disease not poisoning. There's also no evidence to support that the woodruff's even owned a slave named Khloe yet people report seeing a ghost named Chloe haunting the plantation.  Chloe's story gained notoriety when the owner of the house took a chilling photo in 1992 standing in the Breezeway between the general store and the butler's pantry is the shadowy nearly translucent figure of a young girl.  Feel free to search for the photo. It will surely make your skin crawl.  We'll return to our story in just a moment from the podcast Network and now back to the story.  After the death of his family Clark would reflect the plantation slowly degrade until 1834 when he sold the house to roughen gray Sterling and his wife Mary Catherine Cobb, since they were leaders in the community. They wanted to have a home reflecting their prominent social status the property underwent an extensive renovation.  fine furnishings were imported from Europe and the walls of the house were removed and we positioned to create for large rooms a formal dining room and a game room the renovation doubled the size of the original Bradford House and the Sterling's changed the name of the property to the myrtles after the crape myrtles That Grew on the crowns in spite of the Grandeur that the plantation exuded the  Rich's couldn't spare them tragedy Ruffin Sterling died from tuberculosis shortly after the completed renovation. And only four of the nine Sterling children made it to adulthood as many times death has struck the myrtles. It's not surprising that there have been accounts of strange phenomena in and around the property including the ghost of William Winter.  Winter was teaching a Sunday school lesson and the gentleman's parlor the house when a stranger approached the front of the property on Horseback and called out for him winter told his students to stay put and cautiously walked out onto the porch an unidentified man instantly shot him then charged off on his horse Winters stumbled inside the house and died trying to climb the stairs.  To this day visitors claim to hear Phantom footsteps on the staircase.  The history of the Myrtle's plantation was steeped in violence during the Civil War in the early 1860s. It fell prey to Union Soldiers the great deal of money and time the Sterling's invested into renovating. The plantation was for naught as the war wreaked havoc on the property.  Many of their most expensive belongings were looted and destroyed by Union Soldiers post-war their wealth now largely in Confederate Currency was deemed worthless Mary Cobb Sterling had invested in a sugar Plantation, but it was destroyed in the war.  With the property in shambles, it began to collect debt the Sterling Family eventually had to sell the land in 1886. The myrtles changed hands until it landed with Harrison Milton William in 1889 in the early 20th century his heirs split up and sold the land surrounding the house marking the end of the land's Plantation years.  Through the 1970s the house underwent several ownership changes over those years both the owners and visitors have reported strange occurrences around the house when James and Frances Kermie Myers bought the property they decided to renovate.  There'd been a lot of Buzz about the Myrtle's plantation is grand reopening as a bed and breakfast in the 1970s. Probably the person least excited for the reopening was the maid Julie hired for the task of cleaning the entire 22 room Mansion. Julie hated this place the way it breathed luxury. The whole thing was ornate in ostentatious and utterly retching.  But she needed this job. She was desperate to get out of that cramped two-bedroom that uncomfortably housed her her mother at her mother's rat prick of a boyfriend. She smoked a joint to steal her nerves and got to work.  Julie turned on her old antique Radio. She mopped to the rhythm of the music dragging her feet across the smooth marble floor with Carefree abandon.  weird her radio rarely gave up like this  She hit it a few times with the palm of her hand to no avail. Come on. She couldn't clean without music. Even if she was getting paid a cool 10 dollars an hour.  That's odd James and Francis told her they wouldn't be back until late in the evening. She quickly Spritz the cleaning spray throughout the room to cover up the smell of marijuana.  There was something off about the footsteps something distant and intimidating. She didn't dare call out.  She dropped him off in Fright and it clattered to the floor the footsteps suddenly stopped. She stood stock still listening for any movement.  She tiptoed over to the radio and turned it off.  silence  relieved Julie removed her shoes and started cleaning.  They were back whoever it was was walking right toward the room.  No, shout of greedy. No gesture friendliness. Julie wasted no time tiptoeing over to the closet. She shut the door and peered through its slatted louvers. The thin lines of light offered her a stunted and imperfect View.  Julie saw too late that the mop and her shoes were left in the room. She held your breath hoping for a miracle hoping James and Frances returned early. She knew that if they didn't this could end very badly.  a shiny black boot shot through the rooms doorway  it hovered for a second as though unsure of its footing.  Then it came down hard on the floor a second later the man entered.  He wore a Navy colored wool uniform and forage cap. He had a long beard and held an Old Musket. So it leaned against his shoulder like he was in a military March but the most unsettling aspect of his appearance was the gaping Bullet Hole in the back of his head.  The man entered the bedroom head tilted back. He sniffed the air his vacant eyes passed over the closet and Julie slunk away from her slanted view though. She could tell he didn't see her.  He made his way through the room smelling her mom smelling the sheets of the bed smelling the radio.  When he got to her shoes, he got on his hands and knees like a type of rabbit animal and took several quick punctuated inhales.  His head snapped up with a start he stared directly at the closet directly at Julie.  Heroes grabbed his musket and methodically crossed the room to the closet doors when he was in front of Julie's hiding spot. He slowly reached out his hand.  Julie crashed through the closet door barreling toward the bedroom exit the man staggered back at his musket fell to the ground Julie burst through the bedroom door and took off down the hallway her socks struggled to maintain a grip against the marble floor as she reached the stairs. Her momentum was too great to maintain she tripped over one of the stairs and tumbled down hitting the landing of the stairs.  Staircase hard in a daze. She could see the man approached her with his weapon still against his shoulder. She tried to stand but both her ankles were already swelling from the fall.  The man descent it the Stars stare after methodical stare.  Julie tried to slide away in her back, but it was no use her strength seemed to evaporate with her fall the man reached Julie and stood above her he stood there for what seemed like a long and arduous moment.  Then the bullet wound in his head seemed to open first with just a trickle then it poured out of him puddling on the floor next to Julie. She screamed and shut her eyes tight no longer able to take him the gruesome scene.  When she opened her eyes again.  The man was gone.  Later, when the owners and police arrived a thorough search of the premises resulted in nothing. No one was found. There was no sign of Foul Play. They attributed the blood on Julie's clothes to a wound. She must have received in her fall, but when she inspected her body that night she didn't have any cuts and scratches.  Against her wishes Julie finish the job over the next few days since she desperately needed the money one afternoon as she was mopping She Came Upon a blood stain on the floor below the staircase in the shape of a human body.  Julie attempted to mop the stain but no matter how hard she tried it remained taunting her warning her that she was never safe.  Legend has it that three Union soldiers were murdered inside the Myrtle's plantation after they broke in and attempted to loot the house. They were shot to death and left behind bloodstains that refused to be claimed.  Some say mops won't touch the blood stains even inanimate objects know that whatever Spirit lies in those stains insists on remaining forever.   We'll return to our story in just a moment and now back to our story.  Over the years many unexplained happenings have occurred at Myrtle's plantation in one of the Parlor rooms a grand piano repeats the same haunting cord until someone enters the room and it stops.  There are accounts of unidentified sights and sounds of children around the house.  Don't get me wrong. I was happy to get my students out here on a historic piece of land exploring and learning after all. This was a trip. I was trying to get the school to approve for years. We don't have the budget. It's not the right subject matter for kids to learn excuses. Finally. They agreed and the children's eagerness is Testament to my efforts my students and I enjoyed  add a nice breakfast at the general store before beginning the tour of the myrtles. They were more interested in the ghost sightings. The plantation had been touted for but I assured them those were just old wives tales.  Our guide commence the tour on the grounds. The land was vivaciously green and the large pond was idyllic. It was strange to see all this beauty amid, the plantations otherwise tumultuous history. We made our way over to the main house, which was bordered by a 125 foot long Veranda with ornamental ironwork detail the spacious front hall featured crown molding a French.  Baccarat crystal chandelier and a grand staircase. There was no shortage of luxury ported to every detail of this house.  The kids were definitely impressed. So was I the Regal interior appeared almost Frozen in Time as we pass the staircase? I thought I heard tiny footsteps above me. I looked upward curious.  I did a quick headcount of my students. No one was missing but sir, the tour guide called out. I looked up everything. Okay. He asked I think I heard I stopped myself not wanting to sound silly in front of the children. It's just us and the good Lord present sir. The guide reassured me.  I'm not it and they continued walking. I glanced up once more and saw the Hem of a girl's dress dark past the staircase railing above me one of my students Call My Name. Mr. Thompson. I shook off the unnerved feeling and rejoined the group. But as I walked away from the staircase, I could hear a little girl teasingly whisper my name.  Mr. Thomson  The hairs on the back of my neck stood up the voice was scratchy and unnatural and strange.  At this point we made it to the game room which seemed to especially spark the interest of the children. I stood behind the group. Everyone's backs facing me except the guy who was addressing us.  I noticed movement out of the corner of my eye slowly. I turned my head toward the glass door.  The curly-haired little girl wearing an antebellum dress stood outside peering into the room.  Her eyes her horrible eyes. They were pupil Alice and ivory white. She held a small and stubby finger to her lips. I obeyed horrified what the students might think if I shouted in Fright.  She vanished beads of sweat rolled down my face the heat must have been getting to me.  I tried to remember the last time I drank water and suddenly felt incredibly dehydrated.  I hardly focused for the rest of the tour my mind burned with the image of the ivory girl.  The sun was about to set when we finally reached the end of the tour the students took photos in front of the myrtles all the while. I kept glancing back at the house. I felt a shiver down my spine time to go kids. I said as I rushed the students onto the school bus, I noticed that Matthew was missing. He was an explorative child with a big imagination. It's no wonder he wandered off curious little  Her I crept inside the tour guide was gone, but he had not placed any restrictions on re-entering the mansion.  I heard of patter of soft footsteps down the hall and followed them. The empty interior was massive and chamber like every noise echoed missed your Toms in I stopped.  straining to hear the soft voice  Matthew I called through the cavern. He's this way. Mr. Thompson this way but you have to hurry. I didn't know which way the voice came from it seemed to be everywhere.  I saw the mirror and stopped its world with a translucent gray fog in it. I could see the figure of a boy a boy that did not belong a boy desperate to get out. His face was covered with a mixture of mud and sweat and blood his eyes were shut tight and his mouth opened in a scream.  But no sound came out. I was suddenly aware of the cold and thick silence around me. I approached the mirror and confirmed what I already knew. The boy was Matthew.  His curiosity had taken him too far.  I approached the bus confused and disoriented unaware of how to tell the parents that I lost their son knowing that they would never believe the truth. But when I got to the bus and look down the rows of seats, I noticed they were all full I called Matthews name. No one responded. The students looked at me quizzically.  I searched through the roll call sheets tore them apart really examined each check mark next to each student that assured me. Everyone was on the bus. No one was missing.  Matthew's name was not there.  One of the famous paranormal features of the Myrtle's plantation is an ornate hallway mirror visitors claim to have seen handprints watermarks and even figures in old-fashioned clothing lurking inside the glass. The figures are said to be Sara Woodruff the wife of Clark Woodruff and their two children who allegedly died from poisoning at the hands of the famous slave girl, Chloe.  One of these children is believed to be the ghost girl of the Myrtle's plantation. She's known to run about the house giggling and haunting unsuspecting children and adults. There is in fact a photo of a young Antebellum girl standing in the window behind a teacher posing the students on the courtyard to this day the girl remains unidentified, but she has made her presence unabashedly known.  on the premises  Despite the many rumors of ghosts activity throughout the house. The Myrtle's plantation has become a vacation spot for many visitors every year whether it is to unwind or catch a glimpse of a ghost or two. There are said to be as many as 12 ghosts at the Myrtle's plantation, whether it's Chloe the vengeful slave the invading soldiers.  Or the photogenic ghost girl.

spotify:episode:2u3WdI0eprebkF17kS8SV9	All right, welcome to the pub Sports podcast. I am so pleased to be coming to you live again today, you know, two in one week, you know, it's something to be said when you're popular people want more podcasts and that's just what I'm trying to  To give them so before we get to our next coaching profile interview that I'm super psyched about this guy. I'm going to go ahead and remind everybody out there that's looking forward to the the school year to start kids. If you're out there and you're listening just 13 days until you're right back in it right back at school have fun. You know, those are going to be formative times for you a blast. Just keep wait until then August.  The Eighth Day and which you know, you get to fall asleep in class again, so without further Ado let me bring you my next coaching profile interview and now I am joined by a guy I went to school with back in 2011 has now Clara. Well, I can't speak has now climbed the ranks and is the head varsity boys soccer coach Johnny bar ditch coach bar ditch.  Welcome to the program. Thanks Nate. Thanks for having me man. It's it's it's just really cool. I mean it you obviously get to a point in your life in which teachers in which you once had in high school or starting to make their exit and get toward retirement, but it makes way for new teachers and coaches and you know, that's one of the privileges in which you're entering as far as like a new wave of teachers and coaches that prep. So appreciate you joining me. Mhm. Mhm.  So let's get started today with a little bit of ice breakers get us loose and also get people give people a chance to get to know coach Bart it here just like we've done and we did with mr. Ferraro the previous day. Give me height and weight coach. Let's see sitting at six foot 180. All right, we love that. You know, 6-foot guys. It's always like five 11 and 3/4 and now Round Up to 6, so it sounds good. I love a double your six-foot my book now.  Back when you did play Johnny or should you know, I got to get rid of that your you are a coach. I need to treat you like one coach Bart itch when you were playing man. What was your soccer number? I was number seven. All right, give me the backstory why Cristiano Ronaldo? Who was it? No, it wasn't as actually a big Didier Drogba fan. He was number nine, but that's the central forward number. I was a Winger midfielder 7 was for me. Okay, I like it. I like it. My mother my brother wore number seven. So I like that.  Now you have heard this question before but I want to give it to you because it's a tough one in my book burrito or pup muffin. Give it to me. That is a tough one. I think I have to go with burrito hands down burrito. Yeah. No, it was a very common one and people love to get the burrito get a little bit of the salsa now if you did work, so you did you get salsa. Did I did? Okay Saul sky where you guy that opened up the burrito put the salsa on the burrito or did you dip it in the sauce?  Elsa it's a good question. I think I was a dip and go. Okay. Yeah, you know, it's people are on the go. You only got 15 minutes of break. You gotta you gotta you know, make up time somehow. So my next question is this and this is vital. I always knew you as a sack lunch guy back in the day. Give me your peanut butter to jelly ratio.  I go heavy jelly light peanut butter. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. I know P. We got an issue here. We just got word from coach Bartow to hear that. He is more heavy on the sweet side than the salty side. That is a shock to me because if you're out there pup fans and you're on my side and I believe you are it's way more peanut butter than its July. I'm a 60/40 guy. It's 60/40 in my book. You need more peanut butter. It's protein. I would dare say 70/30 jelly. Love it.  As you know seeping out the sides man that is a topic for another podcast, I guess because that would probably get way too heated and we got a way too many things to get to now, let's look at this halftime. All right during your soccer days. It's common you get some snacks, maybe okay and my days for football, it was orange slices. Mmm. So my question to you is orange slices or apple slices. Yeah. It's the orange got to go through orange orange slices and side too.  Capri Sun. Okay. All right. It's the combo. That's fair because I feel like just the orange slices you come out of halftime and you just you put it in second gear man. You just ready to go. Love it. Alright now, let's get into back in your time at prep.  To Dean's that we had. All right. I don't remember you being too much of a troublemaker. You stayed pretty clean, which is good and probably why you're ultimately a head coach now, but if you had to choose, okay between two Dean's we've got mrs. Tom McEwen. Mr. Walker. What was your decision man? That is a that's a tough one. I still deal with both today. I see him very often I coach mr. Walker's daughter. So I need to tread lightly.  I you know, I'm gonna go I'm gonna go with Peggy Hamakua and she taught me a little bit, you know closer Affinity with her in this what I think I'm gonna go with. Okay. All right. No, that's fair. I think if you know, I didn't have the greatest relationship with mr. Walker, but probably if I had to make a choice of go see the Deans and I had to choose between the two I probably are on going to mr. Walker because miss Tom McEwen I could just see if nope. It's black and white  Maybe you were wrong. And you know, here's your job. All right. Now last thing that I'm curious about we alluded to it in a previous podcast when I had Steven Angelo Ferraro shout-out on on the show. We talked about your Johnny hustle ability. So my question to you is if you were to race anyone of your current soccer players, do you think you could beat  Any of the guys currently on your team in a race?  I'd like to think so, but I'm really not sure. How long is the race? Well, let's go 40 and you're doing a for yeah, maybe a couple I'll go I could probably be 15 percent. You know what that means is Dave one come spring season when you guys start, you know, who's gonna be there me stopwatch. I'm marching out 40 yards and saying let's go right now because I know you guys have heard this and hey coach Bart. It's just challenging you and I think many will.  Gladly accept that so you better start loosen up that hamstring right now man right now. All right, so enough with the fun and games, let's jump into the fact that incredible year last year your first year as a head coach. I didn't necessarily follow you guys as closely. It was the kind of thing from afar that coming back into Spokane people looting and saying you get a  That soccer team last year and you know coach Bart is just got an I'm like wait, wait a couple things you bring up the soccer program next. You're saying coach Bart itch. It's like where have I been? So if you could for those out there listening take us through a little bit last year. Yeah, the it was just a wonderful season. I was with the boys. So I've coached JV for three years. This was gonna be my first Varsity season and luckily. I had a pretty good rapport with the boys, you know.  Knew him really? Well and I knew how to push them and everything like that. So going into the season. I knew what we had. We had a couple surprises of you know, a freshman that comes in. There's always a freshman that surprises and then, you know a couple of kids here and there we were pretty young team and it took us a while to get going. We had a very hard spring season and especially a preseason as many know our spring this year was I don't even know.  Cold wintry three feet of snow you name it are Spokane spring. Thank you a yes. Yes a great Spokane spring and we were shoveling our first day of the season. I think our first home game was maybe three or four weeks into the season because we had snow on the field. We couldn't move it, you know, there's feet and feet. So it was it was a tough spree season, but I think we played the motion the GSL we played our full six or seven. We went over to Seattle got you know, kind of got whooped when we played as a quan Redmond, you know to Great State team.  But then we knew we could play with them at the same time. So we kind of came back from pre-season kind of looked our wounds got ready for the regular season and then we kind of went off and running.  You know the spring season four boys soccer. You kind of have to break it up you have before spring break and then you have during spring break after spring break. So you want to make sure that you get I think it's three or four games before spring break. You want to at least get three points for a win one for in overtime shootout loss to for overtime shootout win. So it's all about points in the soccer game. You want to make sure you have at least six points, you know, you want to get a couple points going into spring season. We had a  Again, first game of the season played CV just too pretty old Powerhouse to come to shootouts ended up losing but we got a very valuable point which really came in at the end played a couple more games got a couple more points. So we're going into the spring season spring, excuse me, spring break feeling pretty well. And then you kind of Hit the the dead of the Season where we ended up playing, you know, some tough for a school's back-to-back-to-back had a tough week where we lost to you. Hi Elsie.  He and Ferris back-to-back-to-back, which wasn't great last season the regular season of the game. We play Mead at prep senior night, you know the see I have six seniors on the team where you know, everyone's excited. We're ready to go. We're finally playing some good ball. We have guys back and we just play lights out and up beating them to one and that was honestly me and my assistant we were kind of talking about this. That was what we felt was the start of our season.  The last game of the regular season we made postseason one of our goals and then we just started running and then we think we rattled off six wins in a row 6 of 7 wins. You know, it took it took for our back to be against the wall. But once we were there, we really knew what we had and then we made a run to state which was awesome. Yeah. No, I think that was pretty cool. And one of the things that I had the privilege is I checked out your Facebook page and the pictures that were on there, you know, obviously as you get  older there and you post less and less and so the first thing that was at the top of your page was some photos in which shoutouts middle picks mrs. Micawber had posted on there and it was super cool because it had basically your guys victory at Albion who was that dance in Central Valley that was for the district third place winner out. Excuse me loser out when it goes to State that's cool. And it was a wild game. They beat like I said earlier they beat us.  Regular season we come out blazing we score three goals in the first half kind of unheard of up three nil at halftime CV and you knew they were going to come back, you know, great coach great players Dynamic players and they come back and score 3, you know one goal 10 minutes in another goal 10 minutes after that seven minutes left on the clock. They hit a header to tie it we go to we go to overtime first overtime session.  And one of our players it's a great free-kick game-winner rips his jersey off and we all celebrate and it was almost under at their coach. Okay.  A guy ripping his jersey off after a game-winning goal. Okay. I see the fact that it was a game-winner. But the Jersey rip off had he done that any any point he had not okay, but the passion you've got to love it. It's a classic soccer move know if I was seeing Zlatan Ibrahimovic shower in there and he's cristianos lot on they'll do it. So it was it was a cool scene though because if you have the opportunity  The and you know, you're a friend of the program and also friend of Coach partage. You can see a shot by shot tracking of the goal being scored and then the celebration that ensued after that and one of the things that I wanted to point out that speaks to you as a coach and the respect those kids and loved those kids have for you is if you get to the end of those those shots where coach partage runs over there to join his team in the  Celebration you see kids swarm to him to you know, a coach this is so awesome that kind of thing. You can only imagine as they're hugging and making them equally a part of that celebration that it's hey we're here and you know, you brought us here and that's why we know we're here and it's just that's the coolest thing and I can't imagine that you want anything more than that as I catch it was a great moment, you know in my young coaching career.  Is my first Gatorade bath that was also very cool DMC 8. Calvin is just a great moment. But again, you know hats off to player the coach can only yell so much we can only gain plan so much. It's all up to the players to execute and especially in a game like soccer. I don't have a timeout. I don't have a I have a half time speech but that's our halftime preparation, but that's about it. So it's the kids need to be able to problem solve on the go and you have to be able to deal with the punches so, you know hats off to  To our team is extremely resilient towards the back end and just dealing with you know, dealing with all sorts of pressures that the kids really succeeded and I think that makes me think of the cliche. That's sometimes my dad would look at me and go now Nate sometimes it's not about the x's in the O's it's about the Jimmy's in the Joe's so, you know, sometimes you just have to tip your hat to kids when they, you know, pull through and they make a game-winning goal and it's it really is a credit to those kids.  The hard work they put in you know, nothing to coach doesn't do their job too, but it's you know kids got to meet you halfway. Exactly. So now looking forward and you being a seasoned coach, you've had one underneath your belt. All right old and crusty season KF. What I want to know is what plans are. What changes do you have after that first year into the second year now?   Well for the you know, the coach I was at the beginning of the season of the coach. I was at the end is starkly different just from player management to understanding the GSL season 2, you know little just kind of plays here plays their little just wrinkles in your game that I think I have to build upon for the next season. I you know from the JV level to the first level, of course I was with  RC teams being assistant and all that but it is very very different everyone, you know looking for you for all the answers and I enjoyed that and I really relish that opportunity and I love being a leader. I think me being so young help me relate to the kids really well and especially me being around the program, you know, it wasn't a big, you know, big change or anything like that all the boys really comfortable with me. So that really helped as well but looking towards the future. We lost 16 years.  As you know solid solid players and we have a young crew coming through. So I'm really excited. Our sophomore class is a really really develop technical team. And you know, this is a great team to build on but at the same time did you sell stuff? They're always known I feel like we always send someone to the final four this year Ferris made it to the final four CV wanted a couple years ago. Just really tough tough team. So for the  It's just you know, my preparation will be much different before I had no idea what I was getting into to be honest. Now. It's my player management my dealings with the school and our recovery, which is a big deal of it. All is, you know, well more endowed and I'll be able to hopefully, you know, take a step forward. Yeah, you know for myself and I think a lot of others out there that you know soccer still relatively new to them and something maybe they don't follow a ton, but I think that it's actually picking up steam.  We've seen the success that the woman's USA soccer team has had hopefully the men can make the World Cup next go around. Hopefully what I want for our listeners though. And for even myself when you say something like technical, what do you mean by that for guys, you know Foot Skills being be able to work in small areas. So, you know direct play as you knocking run so you got athlete's up talk try to just blast in technical players are you know, you can work in small areas.  Hate combination passes intricate runs everything like that. Just kind of working in. Yes, small areas great footwork Vision all of that. Okay? Yeah. No, I like that. That's good inside as I obviously get more into the swing of the technical conversation of soccer. So this is good really good for me informative educational you learn something on PSP. All right now expectations for the season.  Right, you make it to the state tournament last year what's expectations this year? I think we have to keep it at the same or raise the bar. I'm never satisfied. You can't be complicit. You have to always push and strive farther and that's something I like to tell my boys, you know never settle always try to reach for goals because you know, you you have to have lofty goals you have to drive for those. So I think making State again this year. We played Federal Way went over to their place.  Up losing 2-1, you know really really good game. Great team that the team we played their Centre mid one Seattle Times player of the year. So, you know, we went up against pretty formal team. I think he had like twenty four goals in 22 assists, which is just out of this world for a high school player. And you know Gonzaga Prep in Federal Way kind of have a bit of a rivalry in different sports. So it's a little tough losing to him, but the outlook for this season is and you know, the boys are used to my coaching style now, I have different tendencies.  These and I have different tactics and now they have that under their belt. I think we'll be able to build upon that and be able to go, you know, a leg farther hopefully and ideally go leg farther. Yeah. No, I think without a doubt especially when you just talked about the fact that you've got young returning talent that they're going to be able to build off of a season last year where they got good postseason experience and that's something to be said because you you can't replicate that in practice to piggyback off that idea you keep  Completely right big game experience especially in soccer is huge because like I said, you can't call a timeout. I can't you know 15 seconds left on the clock of a basketball game. I'm going to call timeout. We're going to run a certain play that we've ran 35 times in practice and we can get a bucket with Sakurai. You know, I can only yell for so far, you know 60 yards away from the play the ball. So what are you doing? Exactly exactly. So it's you know, they have to be able to like I said earlier, you know roll with the punches. They have to be problem solvers on the field. They have to communicate  Anna Kate with each other and then they have to get the job done collectively. So having that, you know kind of with that in mind it's you know, that's that's all very important. Yeah, so to build upon that and everything that you just alluded to what are what are some things that you can give an example of that you've made the team your own what some things that you've come in and you know, I had the team adopt that's you know, coach partage I think preparation.  Actually no preparation is key. So we would spend every training session. We would spend an hour to 15 minutes in the team room watching film going over certain tactics. I'd like to think that I got my team very prepared for the season and very prepared for every single game. We had a scouting report of every team which don't really know if they did that before but that's the you know, that's the time I spend that I put on it and you know knowing if they play a Highline, okay, we're going to try to get in behind.  Knowing if they have to Dynamic forwards. Okay, we need to be pinched and tight and our back line be very compact not allow through balls yada yada yada, you know all that stuff. So being able to be prepared let the boys know what is going to occur what's going to happen. So then they're not surprised and all of a sudden, you know, this left-wingers just blazing down the side and just torturing us all game long and these, you know where that come from. Hopefully I give them an idea prior to that and then also, you know watching film we spoke of it.  Briefly earlier kids are such for visual Learners these days. So I try to get them in front of film as much as possible trying to be able to watch themselves. Watch the team not only watch the ball. But you know Watch Team shape everything like that and then being able to build on that collectively moving the ball forward back possession everything like that. So that's really important. Yeah. I know. That's awesome. And then when you hear coach barter say when we had spoke before it's an honorary thing here the pup Sports podcast.  You're a guest you are truly a guest of honor to come you get a barbecue you enjoy somebody some daddy sodas maybe and you have have a little pregame barbecue before the podcast and then we come down record and that's how things flow. So if you're under the thought process of oh man, what would it be like to be on that show? That's what it would be like to be on a show you you don't know what you're missing out on so gracious host. Yeah.  Exactly. So you touched on some really good things and you actually had said, I don't know if they did that before when you were learning to film work and prep work before your to play a team. What are some of the things though that you adopted from the previous coach before you and who was the previous code before you so I've had great mentors in my life as a player at a great mentor Tim Seeley. He was my coach for multiple years and he really kind of showed me the way of how a player should play.  And then in my coaching career Billy barmes, who's the girls varsity coach, he was the boys, but I've been under him for a few years and then the previous boys coach was burning Croft and he has a wealth of D1 experience in a great coach as well. And he was a mentor that really kind of brought me brought me under his wing and taught me just the ins and out of being  The head of a teen, you know, you have 20 guys on your team. So it's you know, you have all these different personalities all these different egos, you know, bringing it all together. So he really did help me with that part getting team chemistry team morale everything and bringing that all together. So he was a great mentor and and taught me quite a bit. That's that's that's really good. And it's really important. You know, I think that when I look at even a personal experience to watch  My brother here we go. That's that's that's your classic voice crack that you've been well accustomed to now my brother being a Coach and he's been a coach now for I feel it's been over 10 years. Now. He had the privilege of kind of the tutelage of my dad for coach for over 33 years and that's so important when you've got guys that are doing it the right way before you and you have the opportunity to just slowly evolve and take your  Time to take piece by piece of what someone does really well it's so vital and then by the time you get to step into the head coaching role, it's people look at you like yeah, you are the head coach. They don't have that time period where they're like What's this gal about its know we've seen him around we've seen we've interacted with them. We know he's fully qualified and we know that he said great guys come before him and he's our expectation is equal to those that have come before us that's really great. And it's like any profession, you know, you take bits and pieces, you know, you see what they do.  At this certain situation he say oh, you know, I don't really like that. So I'm not going to use that you see him acting this situation, you know, that's perfect. So I being able to do that has been great. Yeah. So what I want to shift things into now is looking at what it's like to be a head coach at a school and general so we know that and we've we make jokes all the time. Obviously we see the crowds that football guess we see the crowds that basketball gets and then you see some other sports and you  You know, you know the three variants. Yeah the three moms and then in the crowd, but what I want to know is what is it like to work with other sports within a program or a place like prep? Yeah, first off, you know, I'm incredibly lucky to be able to be employed at prep and work at prep. It's a great Community the support systems great. They back you 100% and everything. I can't you know.  I can't express how much I've had help from Gonzaga Prep and being able to work with me my schedule but also just you know support me throughout it, but it's it took me, you know, as it once again as a JV coach as able to kind of see how the varsity coach has interacted with parents interacted with coaches other coaches teachers the school everything like that and I was able to pick pieces here and there but you know, it's it's extremely easy. So track takes the field before us.  You know, they're off at 4:45 if they're not, you know, we jump on and they just jump off and you know, it's it's very easy, you know, we rarely have issues and if do if we do, you know, we're always cool headed and able to work it out with each other. That's really good. And I know that one of the other challenges that you must face and you have faced for years as being a JV coach and ultimately be in a head guy when you're not on campus, I mean that presents some time.  A potential conflict with a little bit of an issue. What I want to know is what's your experience been like working with Administration? And yeah being an out of building coach, you know, I don't get to see the kids during the day. I see it as a benefit but also I see it as a little bit of a hindrance because I can't see my everyday I can't you know check on them. You know, some of my kids I find out later, you know didn't come till third period and then they come to training is something I don't find out until you know later down the road but  But being being in out of building coach has its perks as well. You know, I can kind of you know, I don't have to bring my employment to my coaching as well for me coaching is a hobby. It's an outlet. I love it. I have a passion for it. I feel like I have a knack for it and being able to you know, once I come to prep, okay, it's on you know, we're ready to coach or ready to prepare. We're ready to train recover whatever it may be but being able to do all that at the school has been great in the facilities are  Not as well. Yeah. No, I being around that campus and walking down those hallways that's popping into offices and you see 65 inch plasma TVs on the wall, and you're like, yeah life stinks, right? So ya know there are some different things that you know prep is and the community has blessed. It's coaching staffs with and I think that that's awesome. I mean, I'll brag about that any day of the week because it's the community that gives  Is that stuff back? It's not like prep teachers are going out and buying that stuff or you know, just being handed their it's the community that's saying, how can we help? Hmm? Yeah, it's we always have a huge support from the families, which is great. And then also, you know, I come up to the athletic director Paul man for and say hey we want to do two games in Seattle. He says, okay, let's make it happen or we want to go do a trip here or a trip there, you know, it's never an issue. It's more of how can we get this done kind of thing and that's the attitude. I love. Yeah. I know that that really is nice is it  I start to have naysayers every time you come to them and it's like I'll try better now better luck next time. All right now so the other part and last piece of that we touched on how dealing with other coaching staff dealt with how dealing with Administration now the Big E and usually for new coaches is the of greatest challenge. What's it like dealing with parents? Yes my parents for my you  you were great. I once again, I think be coaching that freshman group. My JV my first JV season really helped. I knew all the parents through all four years. We had a great relationship and I think just being honest. That's that's the the biggest key. I I'd like to think that I'm very upfront with all my players playing time. If they have an issue my office door is always open if they can come talk to me at any time and I also try to head those conversations off at the start. So there is no  You know him either hawing like, you know, am I going to play this week? Am I not going to play this week? I'd like to think that in training first off you set yourself apart.  And then secondly, you know, you should know you're standing within the team and any with the soccer team, you know, you have your starters you have your reserve players, you have your subs and everyone plays a part you have to have Squad players just like any other sport you have to have Squad players to bring up the level. So but anyways getting back to the parent issue. I mean my parents were wonderful. I never once had an issue. I you know knock on wood, but I hope to never have an issue but I you know, I've heard horror stories. I've talked to the other coaches in the building and  You know, unfortunately, we're in a day and age where the parents do play a role and I would love for me just to you know, it my relationship was at the kid and me and the sports team and everything like that. I'm I have no problem having a relationship with the parents, but it really should just be between the coach and the the player and that's that's where it should be and but once again, you know, the parents have been wonderful to me and I don't have any any horror stories to tell about that's good and I think  That when you look at how the kids responded when you had crucial victories throughout the year it and even I think in what I looked at one of those photos to it looked as if a dad it's knocked down to the field when your pillow players were celebrating and was right there with a camera to capture every moment of that sounds about right. So, you know that the support is there right now and one piece that I would always say to you parents are as loyal and in your corner.  When you're winning right now, one of the things that you've had a luxury and I think it's a product of good coaching. You can't just say I was just blessed with the good team and I fell into it. No it was again. It's a it's a give and take thing. It's a Meet Me Halfway you had a successful team and that does a lot for parents players. And then also to you have less guys coming into your office and saying about playing time. Hmm and the way that you know, that it doesn't bother them maybe the  They didn't play as much is that every single guys down there celebrating when you get a win and it's not the kind of thing of I'll mosey on down. It was every player in there, you know vests running over there to celebrate with the team and when it comes to parents perception is reality. So that's that's just a whole nother whole nother can of worms that we could dive into it another another date on another episode so last question for you, and and again, I appreciate you  Joining the show and kind of having the ability for everyone to kind of get the Insight on you as a coach and then you know your your journey to get to where you are today that I think is spoken for a lot of the success that we've seen. But my last question for you is what what value does playing in this program at prep bring to soccer athletes at prep. So why why would a kid play soccer?  ER at prep  You know, I think you know prep is it's a great institution, you know, not only with the academics but the Athletics as well facilities are great. But you know, you're going to be able to you know, it's top-notch stuff and with my coaching. I'd like to think that I prepare you and I get you thinking about the game in a little bit of a different way. We always actually let me I'll ask you a question 8. All right. What is the fastest thing on the field?  The ball your brain. Oh, wow. Exactly. Yeah, it's is what you get them at you get him on that every time well, you know biology chemistry and not my or physics was my strong suit, I guess but okay the brain. Yes. I see it. I follow I'm with you. Yeah, so that's something that I think that I like to challenge my kids, you know, I asked them questions all the time. I try to challenge the mentally because that's a lot of you know, plenty of guys are fast. They're strong. They're quick athletic yada yada yada, right?  Not a lot of people are mentally fit or have the mental fortitude to be able to play 90 minutes or excuse me high school game 80 minutes, but be able to you know Shield off a tackle pick up your head find a pass all of that. So I'd like to think that at Gonzaga Prep we prepare you but we also challenge you intellectually we challenge you mentally and really get you ready for the rigors of a game. But then also try to get you ready for business life for a work life because  There's plenty of times when you're in the office. You have to problem solve on your feet or you have to do, you know, a problem occurred and you have to jump out at it or you know, all these different things. So being able to think on your feet think quickly, but then also be challenged in an athletic way I think is really important super important and I've I think I've encountered that plenty of times in which I could Channel back to, you know, an athletic career in which you're on the field and a given moment. You got to make that split decision now we do have one.  Question from a active listener that when I was speaking to him just earlier today. Justin Gates had a question for you former teammate of yes backup club and high school Justin wanted to know and wanted your input of what impact has the soccer program had from guys that solely play soccer only now so back in the day when he said that he  He played he had he was like one of the only guys that played soccer and that was the only sport he played now, it seems do you guys have more Soul just soccer players I would say unfortunately. Yes, the way High School athletics are going it seems to me that you have to specialize by like eighth grade and that's a shame. I I fully believe that she could you play as many sports as possible. There's a bunch of studies out there that say, you know to sport three sport athletes are more resistant to  Injuries and all these different things Kobe Bryant said that he had a lot of success in basketball because of soccer he grew up playing soccer in Italy and he learned how to work in threes and fours a lot of soccer players nowadays working one and two so, you know given goes like basketball, but you need to be able to see the bigger picture and work in threes and fours. So being able to do that is, you know, really really key and question out of it question from a listener. I like it. Yeah. No, I we love acting if the  Sinners out there. And again, we want to open it up to any time. You have a question for a potential interview that we'll have with a coach because we're going to profile every coach at prep. Well, I shouldn't say every coach every varsity coach to cover my bases. If we get to more than that great. I'd love to get into as many interviews as I can. But if you have a coach where you're like when you sit down with Coach bar touch again, I want you to challenge him on this and it will hold as a feet.  Fire see how he handles it but and wrapping things up today. I want to thank you for joining us. And you know, I want to throw one compliment your way. You have a consistent vernacular that a lot of tenured coaches have at prep when I had the privilege of sitting down with Coach McKenna. He spoke exactly in a similar vernacular of like yourself and kind of buying into the prep way and havin Somethin.  And to hold of your own and you know, as far as buying two players and everyone having a role and you know, it's just a variety of things that basically it's just similar words in which he used and you use a as well and so it's I think that's a good sign of a quality coach when someone is already using that, you know, one year after being, you know a head guy and it's the institution to they back us. That's for sure. Yeah. No, that's an excellent point.  Right. So let's just say you're out there and you're thinking where is a good place to coach? Where's a good place to send my son or daughter? Where's a good place in which I can just be enthralled in a community. Look no further. I guess it's like an Zagar prep University. We are we're in their pocket, I guess where we are their number one plug. So again, thank you for have or thank you. Well, thank you for having me. Thank you for coming on the program because that means so much to the show and so much the  People out there. Yeah Nate thank you pleasure is mine. All right, go puff. So I remind you again. My name is Nathan Alfred. That guy was coach partage. You can look to see more interviews with Coach partage come spring season when he's obviously in the thick of his boys soccer season, but we're going to look to actually pull coach bar touch when he is coaching the girls team coming up this fall. So stay tuned. It's that it's not the last that you've heard of him, but remember, you heard.  Erdem here first on PSP and Stay classy out there go pups.  	Nathan Alford is joined by Boys Varsity Soccer Head Coach Johnny Bartich.  We talk to Coach Bartich about his successful first season as a head coach and expectations for the upcoming season.

It has all the information you need to know and then you join along and be like a little club we can have it's just it's going to be cool. I'm super excited. I can't wait and today's question comes from Ben. I need rang range.  And winter gear but I don't want to buy the wrong things. What would you recommend? So Ben you must be from Australia or somewhere like that? Because we're going to be heading into winter rule bloody quick. So there's a few things the layers of the most important thing but when it comes to a lot of the winter gear, you can't beat buying quality. I don't think you get a little rain jacket. You don't need to spend a hell of a lot of money on a rain jacket. They fold up next to nothing.  Stick them in your back pocket. They're good for when you're riding up mountains to have all year round. You can stick them in your backpack and it's time to come down. You put that bad belly on and you're not freezing. I remember this we're going back must be about a decade ago. I decided Fitness was horrible. I had a 24-hour business at the time and some reason I had to go down to Hobart for work and I was getting time. I was taking that drive down to Hobart two to three.  Times a week and the bugger it had an early meeting. I did the early meeting of the bugger. I'm going to actually ride my road bike up Mount Wellington and you've got to keep in mind at the time my I was riding once a fortnight. So I was pretty ambitious and we'll just getting out of winter early spring. So there was still snow on the mountain there's that so I've jumped on the road bike my old trick in slow.  It powered up there was probably a walking pace. It was definitely nothing nothing to write home about but I just had my normal to fingerless gloves. I had had arm warmers, but that was about it and went up there and she had a selfie photo with my Blackberry phone at the time because you know,  Blackberries ruled at that time and we started writing down. I had to stop so many times because my fingers were freezing and had to put them underneath my arms to try and warm them up to try and get some feeling that I roll back down a little bit constantly hitting the brakes because I didn't want to go too fast because of the wind was making it even card. Oh, it was brutal, but I digress sorry. But so I do think the biggest bang for your buck is buying those.  Cycling like a fleecy jacket their field nice, you know like a cycling jacket on the outside, but on the inside, it's fleecy those two-bit. Those bad boys are just about pretty pretty impressive when it comes to water proof. I have talked about me again. I'd do it was cycling home from work one diet and I've cycled to work. I had one of these things and it started pouring rain. I was on night shift and so the next morning, it's just bark hitting with rain and I see  Jeez, I thought this fleecy jacket here are just I'm in the wrong outfit - well, I was horrible. Anyway, so jumped on my bike I rode and I've worked 35 kilometers from home. So it was probably you know, I'm guessing on that day and that Fitness levels probably about an hour and ten ride home and and I gotta get home. I'm dry as a bone by bone the sleeves around my wrists were just starting to soak through.  But everything else was dry another I didn't had no idea though. There was a super warm and I had no idea they Ram waterproof as well. So I'd be looking at something like that a winter vest, but I generally, excuse me.  generally, when you do talk in this you buying really good tie and outfits layers of the best, you know, again me it's my gets - fall down into as he here and so you put on two three cycling shirts, then you put you on your fleecy jacket over top, then you might put it on a rain rain coat over top of that to try and block some of that wind and all that is that then you got a net those neck warmers that come up past your nose than you  It got to to be knees on you got two pairs of socks to your wrapped our foil around your toes as well. You got booties waterproof booties as well to just help a little you got to laser of full leg skins. Then you got your cycling neck straight over top, but you walking around like in the Michelin Man, you got two pairs of gloves on it's just to get through a ride. You think geez by mobilities like a 92 year old?  Old but you're able to actually to that and I not I do it. Yeah, I'm all the people local do it and is due but it's  Long as you got a good quality jacket and you know, you get cycling shoes of winter cycling shoes. Now that you can go into my into temperatures of minus 15 degrees. It's beautiful thing. I haven't got a pair of them. I must must get the mothballs out of my pocket and actually invest in them. But as long as you got a good quality jacket and some good arm warmers and leg warmers and  And shoe covers booties. That's a good starting point. You don't need to spend a hell of a lot, but you can deck yourself out okay for two hundred dollar investment for instance and especially if you're buying so little alarm remind especially if you're buying online, it's generally a lot cheaper that way. Yeah all the best with it. Enjoy the winter enjoy being cold and wet. It's all fun if you guys have any other questions Jump On Through To The  Website, so course moved. I'll come to the next episode. Who Roo.	In this episode, I answer a question on what winter cycling gear you need
spotify:episode:5bdTCvWodachBBIAoGwd3A	I want to talk a bit about as I was talking last week about theological education in general and the opportunity we have ad gads to really develop a high octane practical yet deeply reflective theological educational training for those that are especially within the third wave movement of the renewal movement. And what excites me about is this incredible opportunity to not just hand.  Two people bunch of tools and it's key to have the tools and that's what's great about gats is the courses in Practical. Theology are giving to you specific tools that can be used right away in Ministry, but also to give you that opportunity to back things up and to and to reflect deeply about the underlying theology behind everything that we do in Ministry and the core theology.  Lachie of the Christian faith. And typically the theological the discipline of theology has been divided into kind of several different compartments just it's a way of talking about Theology and it actually is the basis by which when we first started talking as a core faculty a few years ago about developing gatz as a seminary and as we sat around the circle and talked about things it was well sadow's out. We're on the internet.  We were all in different offices, but we all are kind of coming together to talk about what are the key courses that we think are essential for theological education. And you know, there's even if you look in the courses as you take them, you'll see different numbers and letters that are placed on them. And you may just ask just a letter to someone chose a random letter and a number and put it down and they put it next to a course title. But the truth is in in what we talked about as a core faculty at the very beginning we  She talked in terms of disciplines of Theology sub-disciplines of theology. That would be essential for anyone that's going to be involved in leadership within within the church to have sound Doctrine and also kind of practice practical experience and the ability to talk about that practical experience. Largely the theological disciplines. What's the called the theological encyclopedia, which is not an encyclopedia. We think oh, that's the thing on the Shelf we used to use when we were kids making our  Reports right before the internet but encyclopedia is just the division of knowledge of a certain area. So if you're in engineering if any of you were an engineering, you know that there's like 15 to 20 even more than that subcategories within the discipline of engineering and it's kind of if you're in law. There's a whole bunch of different sub disciplines. Well in theology, there's also some sub-disciplines and they really are related to What's called the two Horizons of hermeneutics and in a sense in  Diagram we are standing kind of in the center of this diagram and we kind of stand between the Horizon of scripture and of Revelation. Let's call it Revelation scripture. And on the other side is the Horizon of culture of present-day culture and as Christians, we stand in the center of this and we're constantly in this motion of bringing scripture into the context of our culture in relevant ways, but also our culture  ER is constantly shaping us and creating questions key questions that may not have been asked by earlier cultures or other cultures about scripture. And this this kind of came to the fore with me. I was one of my dog PhD students in one of my classes was from Ethiopia and we got discussing about Theology and I said, oh what what do you use as a textbook for your Systematic Theology and class and and he said all we use Wayne grudem Systematic Theology and just about fell out.  Chair, right? I said really you use rain grudem. How does that go over in Ethiopia? And he says, well we kind of just skip over the first whole section of of the Systematic Theology because it's a whole section that's trying to prove or talk about the classic Arguments for the existence of God.  That's not a big issue in Africa. He said an Ethiopia, we really don't have a problem of that God exists. It's which God exists etcetera, but it's not whether God exists. It was interesting that that the very Systematic Theology questions that Wayne grudem was addressing was it was a series of questions that arose within a western context where there was secularism all around it. And so that raises the question about the writing of Theology and the  Reflection on Theology and the relationship between the Horizon of revelation of scripture and the Horizon of culture and the various disciplines are often kind of placed on a Continuum between the Horizon of scripture and the Horizon of culture. So here's the kind of classic kind of five five car garage of theology that may make some sense to you then of what I'm doing in this in this book The discipline, that's  Has named its closest to the Horizon scripture is what we call exegetical theology. It's very close reading of specific passages of scripture and what the meaning of that scripture is within its ancient context On The Other Extreme the very far extreme next to the Horizon of culture is called the is called practical Theology and practical theology is the study of the ways in which the hurt the scriptures.  Become relevant in are relevant in the context of our culture's today. And in between those two then lie these two kind of disciplines one being biblical theology. That's what I want to talk about tonight and the other being Systematic Theology. Now, you notice their placement biblical theology is closer to the Horizon of scripture and it is partners with exegetical theology Systematic Theology is closer over to the Horizon of culture.  And Systematic Theology is typically understood as answering the key questions that have Arisen within a culture about God in his ways in this world and packaging it in a way that makes sense within that cultural context biblical theology stands next to it and stands closer to the Horizon of scripture and is asking is dominated by the question of what is the meaning of the various?  Biblical passages as they are taken together as a whole.  So the question then is driven by what coheres within scripture as a whole and so the questions that are arising as is what are the categories that arise from scripture the big categories that innocence dominate the Bible where a Systematic Theology is interested in those themes but is interested in packaging it to answer key questions that are arising from culture questions like and system.  Theology who was God theology proper who was Christ christology? Who is the Holy Spirit pneumatology. What is the church ecclesiology? What is what is our view of the end times of time and of you know, basically Book of Revelations Etc. These are key quite what is what is the nature of humanity? These are questions that are being asked within a culture, but it's not like the Bible's written that way.  Write the Bible is not written with a chapter here. That's all about pneumatology and a chapter here, which is all about christology. The Bible is written in very specific way about messages that are being written to ancient people in a time and Antiquity and as we read those those passages and as we listen to that scripture, we begin to see that there are dominant themes that start to arise within the reading of that scripture. So Covenant is a great example.  Covenant is not really a question. That might be as from The Horizon of culture today, but it is a dominating category within biblical theology with in the Old and New Testament in general. You can say the kingdom for instance as a theology is a Biblical theology that has implications for culture. And so these various types of theology are really the way in which the ghats program has been developed and then overarching  You can see in the top hovering above it. All is historical Theology. And you know how my whole fund historical theology is specially because the professor that teaches historical theology lots of fun and historical Theology and the way in which he's teaching it is she's looking at the way in which the Bible has been interpreted in a sense of how theology has been discussed throughout history, especially through the lens of the renewal movement and of Revival, which is really key part of the DNA of gaetz, so you'll have courses that  We'll be in all these different different areas. You'll have practical theology classes where you're learning how to do deliverance and you'll be learning about pastoral care learning about the nature of the church and talking about inner healing you'll have historical theology classes where you're dealing with the history of the church and three different kind of courses, you'll have courses in Systematic Theology where you'll be dealing with kind of larger themes of Theology of pneumatology the Trinity ecclesiology Etc, and then you'll have  This is like we're in right now which are more in exegetical theology which look at specific books of the Bible and then also biblical theology, which is more what we do with in Old Testament and New Testament Theology and I'm always infusing biblical theology into my work because what often happens is if you just do exegetical Theology and you're only asking the question, what did this text mean in its ancient context you haven't made the journey over to the horizon.  Of culture and for me biblical theology is the key first step to making that move from the ancient context and the meaning of this text as it minister to God's people in the past and then the implications for what that message means today within our context our context. First of all in terms of our position in Redemptive history that now we are situated in in Christ and holy spirit is now part of our  Lives but also are placed in culture is sets up then specific application into the lives of our people today as we're preaching and teaching and ministering using scriptural principles as the base for that. So this is the kind of the layout of the various disciplines of Theology. And if you're ever if you're interested in moving on in terms of Theology and doing further study, typically if you move in the direction of kind of the writings of carp Scholars and Demon you'll be working most  Heavily with in Practical Theology and practical theology is drawing from Biblical Theology and Systematic Theology and historical theology. Sometimes more than others in different projects. Right? Some people might be tracking kind of things in historical theology in the in revivals in the past and bringing that through a Biblical lens to talk about implications for Revival today, but you also might be drawing more heavily directly on biblical theology to talk about let's say if you wanted to do something on  On inner healing you would probably want to tap into some of the biblical theology related to Healing within the Bible and within biblical theology. In order to do that reflection. If you're moving and kind of the direction of more of a PhD work you'll do work in one of these specific disciplines almost exclusively are very focused. So if you want to work an exegetical theology, you have to go and you have to learn Hebrew and Aramaic and Luger Riddick and Greek and all these languages because that's the language of the  Ian scripture if you're working in Practical theology you have to do that work in scripture, but you also are going to have to do a lot of work in sociology and working over in culture and understanding the world in which were living being like the people of this a car the past who knew the times I studying the times in the Horizon of school of culture. So the reason I bring this up is because the project that I'm that I'm barking that we're beginning to read is a project in what I call Old Testament theology.  But what I do in Old Testament theology because it's old testament old testament means there must be another Testament called a new testament and so my work is always embedded within a larger project of biblical theology. I want to listen to the Old Testament in its context and here the way in which it speaks in what I call its dialect its language and I would just mean by that Hebrew. I mean, it's thought patterns its way of expressing Theology and all the diversity that you find in the Old Testament.  I don't want to stop there. I want to do biblical theology. I want to bring it through the lens of the new test of New Testament Theology and I'm going to build a trying to build a little bit of a hermeneutic for that for you tonight as we've looked as you've read through the appendix and looked at the way in which I talk about New Testament Theology and connections into the new testament, which is the Kiki kind of point and I will come back to this anybody who takes Old Testament introduction with me. We talked about this right at the beginning of that course to so that you kind  Get another chance to talk about your hermeneutic. But right now here's this basic diagram that gives to you kind of theology in general and and another final point is related to the Seminary is that the typically what happens and I teach at catch the fire at the at the school of ministry here every year they'll bring me in to do some core Bible with them in their in their Advanced module. But this school of Ministry of Catch the Fire is largely focused in on kind of inner healing  A Father's Love kinds of events and it's really kind of working with people especially in practical in Practical Theology and giving to them not only the healing experience that they desperately need with the Father's Love. But also the ability to to walk out Ministry to do practical Ministry with people in the areas of healing a cetera and so practical Cisco's a Ministry are really good with practical Theology and the global school so genetic but National ministry again is a practical theology kind.  Focus type of school the Seminary allows you another opportunity to go to a different level and it's not better or worse. It's according to the needs and what it does is it takes those elements from the school of ministry and practical Theology and now it provides for you the opportunity to do your own digging in Systematic Theology biblical theology exegetical Theology and historical theology. What it does. Is it kind of pulls back the curtain for you and says here are  are the tools that you need here are the theological disciplines and thinking and reflection that you need to be able to come up with a school of ministry the way in which the global School of ministry was with started or the school of ministry here at Catch the Fire or the Bethel School of ministry and that there really is you need to have the ability when I call the Evergreen principle to be able to have that core theology so that you can be part of a new generation that will create even more schools of ministry that  Sensitive to the Horizon of culture that makes sense. So what it is is it's a sense in which it's it's not just teaching you the skills, but it's teaching you the ways in which you can come up with all of the theology that underlies the skill set that's being given to you because you we will have to constantly as part of the church and throughout church history for the last 2,000 years. We've has to constantly go back to The Well of Theology of Bible and systematics of historical theology.  And in order to stay relevant within our context, it's kind of all you think was that keep us relevant. It keeps us relevant because now we have the ability and we have the ability with Holy Spirit to partner together to bring ever new context of ministry in Practical theology to people so I just want to lay that out at the beginning and ask if you have any questions or comments related to that whether you've seen this pattern already in your in your Seminary work,	Mark J. Boda, professor at Global Awakening Theological Seminary, discusses the need for theological education in our culture.

So it's you guys invited me here to like listen to Brian sound drops. We talk about just want to show you what we're capable of they'll use some stuff to plug right? Yeah. So I've been working on this new Star Wars.   How do you only listeners I hope you're enjoying the money only listeners are getting the brunt of this audio. Only listeners cannot appreciate the constant Saundra. We've never had anyone walk out before I think we're gonna have my head.  I've never heard that you get new stuff. So my goal for the rest of this podcast. Yes to talk about things that are so fucking obscure that there's no way he's gonna sound bite for it. Like what? Well, what are you plugging? What do you got something to play you writing a book? Yeah. I'm I'm writing a book about my time in Albania. Okay. I met a man named Cindy.  Hindi yes Hindi, uh, actually this actually happen that's actually completely believe it. He's here. He's here damn it. You look really cool on my shirt. I'm pissed. I'm really hot. But I feel so fucking cool. It's because I don't I don't wear a green and the green meshes really well with that. Some people say I have green eyes, but I never see it. Yeah.  No, they're brown. Okay, it's like a mixed call. My mom a fucking liar. Yeah, I think Cody's fine pea-green. I think that's bullshit anyways, but yeah happy to have you back man. Yeah, it's this is your fourth time on the show. You got the hambone Frank hambone. That's the fourth Bollinger a ham bone is connected to the  I wish but no I that's good. That's like a pig the wishbone theme song Oh, I do remember that show wasn't too big of a fan speaking of hambone. I went bowling yesterday. Nice. Nice. Nice not do well. How many games you did tell me all about it only two we went to the though the one that we went to that one time the three of us there because the one that we acted as friends and we all hung out we did some bowling next to those really loud and obnoxious drunks not a fan of you that's standard of every cause tonight. It's very true. Yeah, but there was a to next to me that phone.  Like an Infinity Gauntlet like on his arm. We have the risk Gardener. Yeah, it felt like he can shoot darts out of it or what was it? Like, what did it look like an Infinity Gauntlet hit the gems on it? No, it was like because it's all bedazzled be something that Cody like you need to start a bowling line and you can have an Infinity Gauntlet. That's not bad. You can do one for Stark to do with the fucking the last week wait. The arm is like The Gauntlet and then on your custom ball you have the gems because you stick your  Her hand in there. So when you pick it up it completes the look. Yeah. Yeah, that's pretty fucking good.  Audio Only listeners, I'm walking out come back break. Oh no, come back. Only listeners. I'm on my drive home right now listening to Linkin Park's numb. What's that sound like  But yeah, he had the whole thing and he was doing okay, but he had like a little baby with him and I was like all the cute little baby but I didn't do great we do two games.

All right. I'm just gonna do it. Anyway. Okay, there's some of the sound bites you were like the humor is like pants, right? Okay. I'm already paying back to the middle Square on one conversation Frank.  Yeah, buddy. This is what I do. This is what I come on your show, and I cried. No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You should work on you should do like you should work on a book like like you know how Tom DeLonge this like crazy about aliens. You should do a book like surrounding top like a non autobiography like a biography. Yeah, non-auto. Yes. Yes so biography, but not from the perspective not from the person connected by a  Three is I'm saying no, he's not coming write a biography on him. That's when it's an autobiography. That's lame a biography is written by someone else. Don't tell me I don't autobiography is written by the person. I like non biography. Okay, as you guys new sketch coming on, you know, it's going pretty well it is. I'd like to clear some some business on the air after a be Ryan brought it up to me over the weekend. Oh, that's right. You guys hang out this weekend, right and I hung out over the weekend. Okay. I thought we were friends and then he's being a jerk to me all day today.  Fun know you showed up. That's pretty cool. I learned that Brian didn't think I was going to show up today. Okay there. How big of a swing did you just take? No, I hit my arm. Okay awesome chair that I love you still haven't taken a swig. So  Because you didn't show up. You're the worst kind of the sky. No, and that's what I wanted to clear the air. Oh shit. That's right. The first time you fucked her mad at Frank so many times you forget when it is. I actually I was having a conversation with somebody this weekend and they asked me Cody I gotta be honest. I still feel the good news is that it's gonna be at least six months before probably more but at least six months.  Is this the sign is your child's got that dream again? It smells like smell better now going on in your guy's ass is that like vinegar literal expression Frankie just it's time to explain this on by other bad. It's not a description, you know fucking swing it. Okay, Frank. Tell your fucking story. Yeah. I don't even know. What was I talking about - can I talk about the sketches that out yet?  No, no one we shot. Come on. What do you drink it like water and wine? Okay, you're not supposed to take that big of a gulp of that. I saw Frank do it, but you only drink beer and wine. No hard alcohol. I don't do heart. No, I don't go hard. I drank a lot when I was in seventh grade. I mean, I'm a little hard but right now yeah, okay. So the this is the sketch. Let's talk about that.  You guys are always mad at me and I couldn't go that day warranted and I'm so sorry. I was working that weekend. Okay, but you literally told me yes, like two days prior. I told you yes two days prior and then the day prior a day later. I step I don't know scramble to look for some people. Actually I can pull up the conversation like alright, so for audio listeners at home and video listeners because there's also no context for this. Hmm. They invited me to a sketch which is  Out soon which is going to be hilarious. I've seen screenshots read the script wasn't weird shoot. Give them the script use ready to go. Yes. Mmm, shut up to Brandon Hannah by the way patreon supporter friends show up did sound is that you didn't sound right? It sounds great. It's the guy from the other day a guy from the other day. We were at dinner lunch. It was like more like a yeah and I take he was sitting across the table from me and I texted Cody, who is that guy? And then Cody said,  it's Brenna. I said Brandon, it's Brandon. He's cool. Yeah, and I responded he seems cool. I just wanted to know if you should ever thought I should have responded to a Frank gehry. Why don't you why don't you introduce yourself to him and say hey because I feel like we've met before saying this again Brandon if you're listening, I apologize.  Hey, those are my head over my head. I've met Brendan three times slowly fine. So the sketch. Yes. Yes, you will show a bring up other than your excuse. I feel bad.

Oh when I can okay, but they think I'm a flake. Literally my words think what you were telling some other person. That was yeah. Yeah, Cody,  Gave you like a 65% No, did I say 600 today? Yeah, I gave him a solid 60 percent chance audio listeners at home. I have a Post-It that says Monday April 18th, April 8 wagons. I'm not by every way to be to be fair to be very fair. I did book you sound so professional. I say I booked a guest I booked you like nothing in the world. I like more than being at this weighing be more fair. We've tried to get you on the show multiple times in the past month or two and you've bailed every single time.  More fair than that, every time that's happened has been 30 minutes before you guys shoot and it's hey Frank just bailed on us. Can you come tonight? And my response is always I would love to I can't be there at 6:30. If you can wait till 7:00 or 7:30. I'll be there in the answer is it's okay, which we totally can wait till said, we probably gave us we could have totally we usually don't even start talking p.m. Right now cept know it's 7:20. It's not quite  No, fuck for real. Okay, Frank was pretending to leave. How did you have a clock?  Taking ready for anything man. Give me see speaking of being ready angry great. It's okay, you know, it's totally fine. I was about to go into but there was a note have you guys forgiven me? I forget I forget things very quickly yet. You didn't because you've brought it up and I said if you show me hung up outside of work you brought it up. Well if you showed up today speak into the mic. Yeah, I'm speaking and telling the sound Guy. What's a little tense? Yeah.  Yeah, I was a little peeved. I was peeved you've been peeved at me before I've been people you boiler alert. You're going to be peeved at me again. When in the future. Oh, it's like a do, you know something that I did you and I want you to know that I don't mean it and I'm very sorry every time it hurts me. It really hurts me to hurts me a lot. Wait back to what I was saying. So the sketch I asked ya last me two days before asked I  Yes one day before. Yes. I said listen Okay. I was supposed to be finished with this thing at work. I'm not finished. I'm so fucking stressed. I had I was Panic attacking all weekend. I didn't say you were Panic attacking so I thought I was very stressed. Yeah. I said I'm fucking would it be the end of the would it be the end of the world if I couldn't make it? What no. I said would it slow down production if I couldn't make it or could you have other people helping and you set are you pulling up the  Trying to I was pulling up something because I remember one part of this conversation. No, you're about to get upset because I remember checking Instagram that day. Guess I'm about to bury Frank here area that so as he was stressed out and having panic attacks that day. We shot the sketch. I remember looking at his Instagram and guess you saw dumbo that day. Oh no, I did I did and after you finish your thing. Let me tell you what time I said number. I think it was at 8:00 or 9:00 at night under stress over time. We're done with your job then you started.  In the day and when I saw Dumbo it was because I was at work. Oh and I was so fucking stressed out at work. I was like, I need to go for a walk. I can't like I'm that's who our why mine and I was moves too hard. Oh fuck. I thought that was like a the Dumbo score. Yeah, specifically the 2019 to monster. I'm done. I'm out. Love you buddy. So glad I'm here. Oh, I think they like each other is yeah. Alright. Anyways, you guys are mad at me. It's fine.  Let's move over to housekeeping housekeeping God. I would be pissed if I was a patreon supporter and I paid for this. I am a patriot or do our veins read support sign up for patreon. What do they get Christian? They get patreon.com slash Wingers is what you get. If you sign up for our Patron you pledge to us one dollar is what you get for an extended Wanger Show episode where you get it like about 10 minutes before the show actually starts about 10 10 minutes wrap up.  Can I be totally honest sure and you also get a day early? I didn't I don't feel like we said anything super cool in the pre-show patreon. I think it was still fun as a backup. I will reveal some life-changing information. You have some deep dark secrets about myself that nobody's ever heard on the point that I gotta like. It's gonna come up with something. Well Grace said, she had a Grace that she had a big secret it actually wasn't that big of a secret he can reveal her.  Now know because I feel bad nature and now we're like can you reveal that the Patriots section? I will reveal it if you have both me and Grace on that's good. That's pretty good. Have you told me? Okay? No, damn it. I'm filming. Oh I might get another shot on patreon around the the Winger show, whatever don't shoot our patrons. So $1, you can find the show three dollars. He's a nice little tantrum and that's what I'm subscribed. That is what you're subscribed to you where you can also not only watch / listen to this show a longer an earlier version.  But you can never do get commentaries like the recent one that coding I did for the Pokemon Indigo series, which is simply and that's right chuckling down that into like done. Yeah see Frank. What are you only other person  We would have Exempted we would have accepted the Corn Flake theme song. Yes, but that's fine. So we put that out and a lot of people seem to really enjoy that one. So I think Cody and I maybe just Cody and I don't know if Brian would want to do it. I don't think Brian would want when I want to do it, but Frank definitely would want to just wouldn't show up for it. We will do more of those in the future. We like doing those episodes their short. What do you to the point? What do you think? I do like when I leave work? I don't think you leave work at all. Okay, so back off. Okay, it's okay.  No, it's okay to say no. We're going to get into those little housekeeping. Let me let me finish housekeeping in the middle and take phone calls very soon. Okay, and some people want but yeah, some people want to talk to you. All right some all right. Oh nice. So along with a $3 tear you get behind the scenes and bloopers videos and we did a recently a behind-the-scenes / bloopers of our recent sketch Uber. They came out just this past weekend for the live audience bloopers.  Fuck that spell it bloopers gonna do that. YouTube video says bloopers felt like uber. No, it was my idea. There you go. I'm gonna have to change it now don't come out but you can get that exclusively on page when we don't release that to the public. So if you want to see a lot of behind the scenes stuff, it's not so in depth like we did the making of the runner which is a recent short film we did as well but it's a nice little look behind the scenes some alternate takes some outtakes. It's a lot of fun. These guys are really really great in that sketch. So if you haven't seen  Sketch to it's on our YouTube channel. Thank you. Everybody that has watched that and comment it share it to your friends like the video all that stuff. We have five dollars here. We got a $10 tier five dollars here.

It's not an official tear or anything. We just give it to you because y'all the shit y'all the best. But yeah, if you have not seen our recent sketch video It's called Uber. It's really great. It's a lot of fun. We had fun making it that is up right now on the YouTube channel amateur our films which is a channel you should subscribe to because we put out new sketch videos and short films every  Month, we try to alternate but these past two months. We're doing sketches. We did the Uber sketch in well technically for the patreon peeps. Y'all got it in March, but we really see the public in April and then this month for the patron Peach you're going to get another sketch that we just shot the one that Frank bailed on us for it's really funny it honestly I'm not trying to Hype it up. I'm not trying to keep it I can attest to this having only read the script before you guys images which script for you guys fucked it up by actually shooting it the  that is hilarious. Did you read just Brian script or the revised Cody script and I've read both are great. Honestly. I want you to release the enough somebody the for the bride. I want you to release your script version of the script just because it's so obscure and there were some things that were just one big part that we took out. Yeah one big wet for obvious reasons. Yeah, but that's I want to know the obvious and I saw that just wonderful damn it.  Showing our phones while you were doing housekeeping. I tried to log into still housekeeping. I know while you're in the middle of housekeeping. I tried to log in to sign up for the $5 peer. Yes patreon here to here Pierre patreon tier I could see where he fucked up there.

Somebody goes there but just saying I'm gonna say I don't mean to point this out then my housekeeper. I don't mean it. I don't mean a hype do U my mic play a sound clip go. I don't mean I had this up. I've been editing our newest hit me while you do housekeeping finish. They have might actually finish this. All right guys, this is is I'm gonna pee. Yes, I'm gonna bring the mic with me. You're not there.  It's one that's that you're cutting right now newest sketch that we just shot that when I drank that I revised. Yes Brian wrote. How do I credit that in the credits? No, no. Okay. So I'm always like the liquid with the Uber one. Did I miss? No. No, you did it fine. I want I think we did it the right way as far as like wga standards for holds. I think you still get the credited right? I would say I did an uncredited rewrite on it. Which one do before the Uber or the new one. The newer one is more you than yeah. Okay as I  More YouTuber than I did the new one. Yeah. Okay. Let's say so what I put written by just Brian Perez are both put us both of you. Okay. Now let's go. I'm not gonna fucking I'm not gonna fucking sue him know he's gonna get top billing for sure. Absolutely. Yeah, because I need to know these actually he in wga Stan. I think the second one credited is the final one. We gotta look that what you didn't do much on the now I didn't know you didn't know you fixed the Uber one because Uber when wasn't like it was half done. Mmm, I'm gonna scan it was good. Both of them were really good. But as I was saying before,  This this this next sketch it honestly might be our funniest one that we've done really do they translate it. It's so fucking bizarre. I know I know it might have been the hardest. We've laughed during shooting a man and I got to see how it comes together. And when I cut that one together, there was a certain point where I I stopped laughing not because it wasn't funny but because I've been through it so many times I can't watch it anymore. And that was like a such a rigorous thing to cut because there's multiple angles. I had to kind of figure out all these things put into  This one it was literally you can come back and bring the fuck out of me. He was very creepy in the shadows. Yes, every time I go back and I go through all the footage. I am constantly fucking laughing really like it is non-stop laughter all the way through it might be a little long, but honestly, it's going to be so fucking worth it. It's so good. I'm very happy and proud of like the things that we shot for it. Yeah. I don't make great together that you know would make it easier for your guests to sit.  In here if the guy who doesn't say anything and it's just playing sound bites isn't even sitting there and you just add the sound bites in and post then I could have sat there and I wouldn't have all this room over here. There's a lot of room and you anyways you're the wall that sketch will be out for the painter on peeps probably in like two weeks maybe and then for the rest of the peeps at the end of April and we also just started shooting our next short film. Oh, that's a serious one. So if you want, it's good. I'm just saying yeah it is.  If you want also a part of our $1 tear you get access to our Discord service server scuse me. It's not a service and a self-service both of them cerveris Cerberus board. If you pledge to us for $1 you get access to that server and I created a new channel called amateur our films Productions, which is basically just calm it is basically just all the stuff that we're constantly creating.

Have you been there before? We're all going to Chicago this weekend out of me? No, I'm not mad at you. He's Elise a little talk about the shake big. I can never be mad at Frank.  But Chicago this weekend if you're out there and you see me, come say hi, you know 20 bucks each don't say don't say hi. Don't really ask one of us to take a picture of another person at the other one. That'd be really good that we really want. No group photos. Just an individual wants with the other one taking the picture with him.  Yeah, another person taking the photo of us taking the photo of like will arrange all of it to where like everyone has take a photo of somebody, you know, it's not her people at this at this new venue. I'm sure it's gonna be people that say hi to us. But if you're out there, yes, they say hi to us. We're really excited. We got the mark Elsa special Star Wars celebration yada yada yada, but because we're going to be out there all week, and we're not getting back to like Sunday night. So we don't have a guest on that. Monday is just going to be me clear. I'm just gonna chill available. But are you  Maybe we'll see we'll see - I say you're available. Now. I booked I see it. I said the word of God book. I booked a guest for the last two weeks because I figured the Monday after we get from celebration Ruby tired as fuck. We just kind of wanted we still talk to anybody don't want to talk to anybody to be plugging their ship with a weekend all that you've got to guess that you don't have to plug any no whore who just wants to come and chill but the week after that a week after that and then the following week after that our great friend Brett. Sheridan is gonna be on the show and that's  What and Brett never been on the Winger show but can I like boys? I don't even have to kind of like you sit and you just want to be there for the taping of it. You're saying Frank. I'm trying to keep you afloat. Just hang out. Yeah, that's not cool. I'm done with housekeeping now. All right, we're gonna talk about Frank. Thanks. Everybody appreciates me, but you also know we did be awesome.  Because it was free and I don't want to pay for that first year for you, right? I think just the first one is the second one on YouTube. I thought it was I watch the first one on YouTube. Did you finish it? I'm half I did I get it. Yeah, I don't like it and I wish my wish I did not take my issue is that they're too fucking long?  Like the whole each episode, this is the reason that like M Night Shyamalan became a joke for so long.  Patron audio-only listeners, I threw a how are you guys doing the cabinet you I'm on wasn't a joke for a while. I'm sorry. Yes. Yes it I thought you said he was just a joke for a while and forever take that very personally because I do love him. Nothing else exists without the twist your movies garbage. Hmm. I don't like the sixth sense. I don't think that's the only thing that there's a lot more you don't need to hang up. No. No you do because the whole thing with the Sixth Sense  That there's the Twist and then it's over it all builds up to like you have to know the twist once you know the Swiss. Oh that is so not true and much more that movie that this relationship with the kid and his mom the whole fucking aren't there. I might not that's great. General is worth seeing that movie.  I got that but that's it's a walk that back then because I disagree I disagree but I'll walk about another signs either Minds is a great fucking movie about religion compete. They can be good movies, but the problem that every Twilight Zone episode has and most the old and a lot of em night shyamalan's shyamalan's episodes and we're best friends. It's gonna be best friends easy. Take a chunk. Is that if the whole thing hinges on a Twist once you know the twist there's no point in watching anything else. No, that's totally not true. So  Really? No. He does not like fully rely on. I'm not talking about M Night Shyamalan. Okay your side my Twilight people forget. I brought it up Cody edited out. All right, he does and we're back now. Okay, and the original Twilight zones. They're great, except they'd be great if there were five minutes because the way that they work out is it's like  Most of it as filler it's all filler until like okay, where's the Twist? And now that's the twist. Oh, it's been crazy. You thought that the world was freezing to death, but actually it's burning to death spoiler. So like I said that's inverted, but the one that I love isn't that Beholder Beauty and I Beholder one that just took forever to get to the point Dana they draw it out on purpose for so long because it's like fuck we gotta feel like 40 minutes. So do you like I know this is slightly different but you like Black Mirror. Yeah, because I don't think that it's a completely different.  It's not like they don't lying on. Yeah, they it's not like at actually some of their episodes. Yeah, they have some some some of the episodes do have a Twist at the very end. And those are the shitty episodes but it's the ones where you can have a Twist, but if you can't I just don't think you like twists. I think well, I don't know all the Twilight Zone old episodes, but my favorite one ever was the monsters are due on Maple Street between them. I love Bobby the bars. It's a good one, maybe but that whole movie is about  It was so heavy. It's about like even if it's good, but it's like treading water to like alright, give a little bit away. Don't give it away now go don't give no it's not giving it away. Like you can do that episode without the twist at the end and it's still good The Twist is just a nice little  And that's how a Twist should be. I don't see the twist at the end. It's still an engaging epis. Yeah the same thing with like unbreakable. Like it's a good movie in general. It doesn't need all that sweat. So some have a Twist like Sixth Sense has a Twist on it does it's pretty Twisted. There's like a reveal mmm. It's either a Twist so reveal. So your problem with the new Twilight Zone episode is that it took too long to get going. I agree with that. I feel like it's like 40 minutes or whatever. It said. It's gonna be five minutes. Yeah. It could have been a 22 lights 15.  Everybody immediately gets it the first time somebody disappears. It's like all right, the the like Twist of this episode actually when he says I'm like, oh he's gonna do this to get rid of that guy. And yeah, there's it's very predictable. Yeah the Middle where it's like, all right, we're going through the motions of like now, he's got it and I was gonna do that. That's what it well that's why I stopped watching. It felt like a condensed like movie. You know what I mean? Like you was like a formulaic movie. Yeah, like it followed every single beat that you're supposed to hit. Yeah, and then at the end you're like, oh I saw exactly where that was going. And so  Yeah, I didn't love the first episode although I want to see the rest of it. I'm just not gonna pay I didn't hear the second one is good. Yeah, the something at 3:30 waited a few minutes to talk and then he just said he just touches. Yeah, I'm probably a great mood. I'm having a horrible time. Anything bad about M Night Shyamalan how fuck you really threw him off there Frank how dare you the village, you know who suck so Village is one of my like I don't want to see favorite movies. It's really under I say  it's one of his more underrated. The village is my favorite M Night Shyamalan movie. Okay hands down.

Tyler question. How's it going?  It's going good. I bet you guys that were dinner. We're doing a little better now. Yeah, how many Johnny Depp questions? That's Frank answered so far Frank, what the hell? Okay. Stop yelling. Frank has not gotten a single Johnny Depp question a lot of yelling that from the Winger's over here. We haven't done anything yet. Okay. You bring it you hit us with a Johnny Depp question.  All right. What is your least favorite performance of Johnny Depp's? You probably said many a times but I can't think of it. I mean I can't stand it. I mean I'm going to answer first but I can't stand Johnny Depp in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. That's yeah one of them that's gross. I'm so torn on this because I hate Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, but I blame Tim Burton for that and I think I think that Johnny Depp was given a unbelievably difficult.  Challenge of like here's a beloved performance by Gene Wilder that nobody in the world has any issue with all righty. Now do your take it's like what are you gonna do you obviously are going to go in the complete opposite direction. He was doing this weird. Michael Jackson was like easy kids like we're like Tim Burton put them in I think Johnny Depp's performance and that was great given the conditions. He was given you gonna answer.  Oh, no, Jesus Christ. He's mad at me. Right? Sorry Tyler. I'm gonna answer succinctly my at least performance. My least favorite performance by him is the Mad Hatter and Alice in Wonderland. All right. Do you have a least favorite? What about you? What do you think?  As his worst performance the tourists he was in honestly. I hate I hate the tourist more than most never saw it me neither, but he didn't look good in yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I heard he was good as white but he well that was a good performance was good. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. The movie was a lot better Tyler before we let you go. You want us to do you want to ask just one more question? No, I think that's it.  I got a couple questions for you. Okay, Frank. Okay, Chris Jesus Christ Frank the list of Tyler. It's ok. Don't know this because you haven't seen the rest of the episode yet. But when you watch this Christian and I are about to fist fight apparently Tyler. What's your favorite do that Tyler? What's your favorite Johnny Depp performance? Ooh, it's it's the same as everybody else. It's got to be Jack Sparrow from black girl, so  It's amazing. It's especially when you consider that that part was not written for him to be like that. That was written as the most like Bland vanilla like, oh, he's a kooky pirate. Johnny Depp showed up. Yeah eyeliner on like started acting crazy. The Disney Executives were like, he's Picard exactly Johnny Jack Faro Jack Sparrow.  Jack Schmitt can Tyler here this or is this just me hearing the drop? I don't know. I like Jack Sparrow was based on Keith Richards and Pepe Le Pew mixed together. Oh and when Johnny Depp started doing it, all the executives were like is he gay is he drunk? I don't want to see it and they want it to fire him.  And he said with it. Yes suck at Jerry. Do you guys do you guys remember when there was someone who used to work at collider that doesn't anymore that this is like a year or two ago and they were playing this song around the office like it was like they like it just came out like wasn't already 7 years old like have you guys heard this song you see the douche and they started just playing this song. I've already put in my description of the person talking. I'm not we appreciate you.   Proven call of detectors roubaix. Can I play the show? I know I need I need to pause this all for a second room and hang with me Christian. Are you actually mad? All right. No, I'm not. I remembered. You're actually ready Frank thinks I'm mad at him for some reason. But even though I think Frank is supposed to be mad at Brian right now for playing all these sound bites, but Ruben, you'll find that out later. What would you like to ask us here on the Winger show?  So knowing Frank was going to be on I wanted to ask a you know, what I love you. Let me answer the question. What is the best performance in a Tim Burton movie? Oh.  The last color so that was that was that that was the last caller know the last caller asked Tyler ask us. So what was the best Johnny Depp performance? So now who and they're different there are different. Okay. So what performance in a Tim Burton movie with yeah. Alright here. We are men good one. Let's go that's better. So the issue with that is  that's that's that's his first movie. No. Well, the problem is and any movie before the year 2000 is not good. Well that but I have a hard time like Pee-wee's Big Adventure is a Peewee movie like it's not it's not it's not wheeze. It's happy Burton is a theory Herman movie. It's like, okay. It's like Iron Man 3 where it's a good with a couple of perfect. You shut the fuck up right now like Tim Burton did an amazing job with that. But that was Pee-Wee's movie like 100% uses The Hired Gun it wasn't he?  He was able to he put it was the first movie. Yeah, and he did put a lot of spin on the performances, but I think that that one's tough because it is a Pee-Wee Herman movie first and foremost. Mmm. Sorry later pulling up Kelly what he couldn't do it. I was gonna google Burton's filmography so I can go through them. Like I see who is the best noun and the last thing I had pulled up on my phone was racism and Christian America because I Googled racist people. They are Christian Ruben. Have you heard about the Tim Burton?  Racism controversy. Oh, this is recent because I haven't either moving on. Oh, wait, wait, wait, we don't need it. I do want to get Reubens answer first Ruben. What's your favorite Tim Burton performance?  I'm like I got to so once an obvious one, which is obviously my kids Beetlejuice. That's kind of that's that's tough to argue. I'll even say what's her face in Beetlejuice. Oh, what's her face Leah really million said Lydia. My mom's name is Lydia. So I know that name. Whoa! Wait wait Ruben, I gotta stop you once.  Check out via check out the Winger's commentary with me and beardo doing Beetlejuice in a couple weeks whenever Christian stopped being mad at me. And if you don't bail on us, my favorite is Jack. Guess what man? What the fuck really? That's not a good that's that's fun.  Yours and mine is your favorite performance. That actually might be my favorite one over so torrent. So here's the deal Edward Scissorhands is my favorite movie of all time. It's my favorite Tim Burton movie of all time talking to me. It's one of my favorite Johnny Depp movies of all times. Wait a minute if we're talking strict performance in a Tim Burton movie.  I think it might go to Johnny Depp is Ichabod Crane in Sleepy Hollow. Johnny Depp is just like Love Christina, Ricci and he's so good. That's one of my favorite every time he faints when he sees a drop of blood and huh. It's pretty good. You know that you're gonna go with James Franco know that I'm sorry. That was James Franco and that Tim Burton movie and we'll sort of Oz I was thinking that's Sam frames. Are you a fan of Sweeney Todd?  You obviously haven't listened to the meaning of podcast by rb3 and here on it was a salon last week. Check out the YouTube channel. First. Tell you interact Sweeney Todd. I was not what I do. I do. I was not a fan in theaters and then watching it at home. I became a super fan and I love it now and I think it's because something about musicals when you watch it in the theater. You want to fall asleep that and you're like,  Along to it. Yeah, and then you watch it at home in your rug. Oh, yeah, man into a fucking Indian shit use, it's good. It wasn't like you can't you can't say it was at that moment when you're in the middle of a movie theater, but you watch it at home. You're like Good Eats.  He says it exactly like that. It's go. He's Italian it's fine. We have Johnny Devon studio and never seen it the most identified. So wasn't Johnny Depp? I saw it. Once the most I know but I like this from the Army's but what's your favorite? Oh, that's what's your favorite Tim Burton performance converting performance. I'm having trouble thinking of the movies that he's done. I love big eyes I've ever seen big eyes. It's big. No, he's got a movie called big guy stupid and big fish.  Did he drink a shoe? We got big eyes? Yes. Amy Adams. She got fucking big eyes. It's got Cruise take a look. If you want to hear my take on it check out the meaning of starting a saint rb3. They're wonderful.

Ruben where you from  I am from Texas City. You like movies Ruben the big state of Texas. Yeah, really? What's your favorite Tim Burton movie? Mmm, that's good. I probably would go with and  I really I don't when I first saw the ice will be able to probably one and then the second one is probably big great.

Lawson's a high Lawson. Yes. So I've been wanting to record for Lawson for such a long time and I don't know lost and start talking. Yeah, so, my name is Lawson me and Ali met in second grade. Oh my goodness. Yes. I love her a queer. So cringy if you guys follow a lie on Instagram don't you have that picture from field day? I think I took it all you took it all. Yeah. I'm like the quintessential that's like what I think of  I'll post it for the little like yeah, we were just the most awkward just like dorky or he kids and we just came best friends and now we're like still best friends to this. Yes. Well great. Is it now? We're in 14th grade and we're still best. Yeah, that's crazy. So Lawson goes to UGA. Do you want to talk a little bit about Yu-Gi-Oh. So UGA if you guys don't know that is University of Georgia in Athens. It's about two and a half hours from our hometown north kind of like an hour outside.  Of Atlanta. Basically, it's like a really big school. It's like this state school for where we're from but I am obsessed with it like a lien is like I'm a tour guide. I literally give tours to try. No, that's so I freaking love it. It's a beautiful city. I'm just a great school. That's fun and see I'm an Auburn fan. So I like grew up hating Dora job, but now I actually pull for Georgia if they're not playing Auburn because of awesome. Yeah, they still feel like our biggest conflict it literally it was like shut up.  Lost. Did you have like a statue in your yard or something of like? Okay, I feel like one Halloween or something. You had like a gravestone of UGA and if you are I was so mad. No, I just like know I had an all be I had an all be like inflatable my parents used to put on game days out of it. It wasn't, you know, like like the Snowman and stuff looking over tiger sticky. Who would you said that was thinking like the floppy guys that she's like, yeah.  Literally like that material. That's what we had. Like. Our whole house is Auburn. We still have like an Auburn shower curtain in our guest room and like meanwhile, I literally like wearing a UGA sure. Yeah, that's alright. So let's do some highlights and lowlights because I love this part of the podcast. I don't know if everybody does but it's one of my favorites every single. So what's your highlight from this week seeing you? Oh Honestly though Honestly though. It's been a hard couple weeks, but I was looking forward to seeing you. Yeah, we've been chatting a lot about it.  I'm like excited for you seems like it's on the up-and-up. I hope so October was horrible, but I'm like really excited. It's like November. Yeah, it's a new month know you looking so wait. What's your low light then know you do your highlight them all okay my highlight. So this week. I had a big ol accounting test. Oh and it was awful. It was just gross. I actually really like counting but this one was awful and my highlight was after I finished it. I got to go to bed early and then the next day  I just came home and I like came home to like visit you and visit my grandma like that was basically why I came and it was just really fun and I got to do the drive with my friend Kenzie. So it's just a good time like just that that in between having that test be over and coming home to like this. That's kind of what's really like, um,  I don't know. I feel like my lights are always like not really that problematic doesn't have to be I don't know. I've have some boy problems last couple weeks, but we're looking at boil boys are problems. Yeah, they're just very problematic. I don't know. I guess I'd be my only thing just in problems with boys, but like I'm ready for it to be over, you know, wishy-washy live and you learn and you keep going and that's how you gotta look at it for ya. What's your little like, my little light would it sounds so lame like plays off my highlight, but that accounting test. It was just wrong really  I got a hundred on the first one, which is just like yeah, I think that's like a weed out class. But that one girl. I was kind of sick to I had like a sore throat on some medicine. It was just really rough. So we'll see if that's actually a little light when I get my test grade back. But right now we're going to eat you all say that you probably look at 99 whatever. I mean honestly Lawson's like that guy like he'll literally say, I don't know I felt about it when I say that I mean like a 50 loss of family good 98, like honestly like school school is just rough. I love school though.  I bombed and accounting quiz my first bad like a grade in accounting, but if it be but you have like good great. So it doesn't matter. I mean, yeah, but like yeah, it happens to the best of us that I miss my first assignment in one of my classes, but it's one of those cost that has like for Simon's every single day. Yeah looking like matter. Yeah. I missed the first one that's just about stars bad for Lawson because I literally like love school. I'm like one of those few people those weirdos that like enjoys the learning in class and this and that but  I don't know. It's been a great semester for me though academically, it's good. Honestly, I feel like since I transferred I do enjoy School more like at Kennesaw. Yeah, that's the first time I've said to kiss off. Yeah, we did Kennesaw State it's but no I feel I don't mean to say that honestly though. Like I didn't enjoy school at all. I'd ready to go in the class every day. And like now I honestly don't mind because I think it's because I live alone so I know if I don't go out and like go to class. It's like my that like guaranteed social time, you know, so it's just important. Make friends in classes to yeah, and I feel like as you keep going with school, you're gonna you're gonna start living even more because it's gonna be marketing classes soon. Yeah. And Claudius is smaller. Yeah, and literally y'all Ali has known she wanted to be a marketing major since I've known her. Yeah, like I think like even in second grade you like that's going to be a YouTuber before YouTube was this literally and I just like you're going to be so good at that all for you. Thank you. Awesome. Yeah, I did an Instagram poll a couple days ago asking you guys which  topics you wanted to see and everything and I had probably six or seven people say they wanted to hear about friendship breakups. So the other night I actually recorded an episode and I did it alone. It was a so episode and I just never posted it. I don't think I'm ever going to I'm probably going to delete it because I don't know. I feel like I wasn't being authentic about it and I didn't really like I wasn't sharing my own personal experiences experiences. So I was like, well, I'm just, you know, I wasn't feeling it and I think I talked  Out that in the last episode uploaded but since I have somebody here, I think I'm going to talk about it with Lawson because Austin's like been there since the beginning, you know, he has seen, you know, a lot of stuff that's happened in my life. So I feel like I'm just talk about it with you. Okay Ali so I think it's important to ask first like what is a friendship breakup. We need to like to find that before we go into the conversation. Okay. So basically my eyes of friendship breakup is just like a regular break up that you would have with anybody else, but it's a friend. It's your best friend or  You know, I feel like it's hard sometimes when you have a friend that you're so close with that's like a brother/sister to you in a way and when you go through that it can hurt just as bad as a regular break up in my opinion and my experience has yeah and I think is important to note that in the same way that it's just like a relationship breakup. Like they can be amicable to you know, like sometimes you just don't fight with people anymore. And that's definitely the case sometimes so it's not always like a hard break where you like to have a fight in an end things, you know, like it can totally be like  We just don't really Vibe like we used to you know, I think it's important to kind of talk about that. Yeah, I agree with that too. I think sometimes people just I mean you always see quotes felt like outgrowing certain people from high school or just really any point. I mean real life, you know, but I agree with that. I feel like sometimes friendship breakups gets like a really like nasty like- I but sometimes it's not always like that and even without growing people that can also have a negative vibe because people can be like you've changed and then that and like I don't think there's anything wrong with people changing, you know, like growth is important growth is it  Important part of life and like I am so lucky that I'm not the person that I was even like last year. We were just talking about this. Yeah. I just said and grow like I just said in Kroger how a lot of people regret things that they did like years and years ago, but honestly, I was like not in a good place a year ago. I think I've grown a lot in the past year. So I think that's a really important even if it's like short-term Improvement. Yes, you know and think about like if you would have made a best friend a year ago, you know what? I mean? You probably couldn't be the  Same friendship with that person today just because that like how much you've grown just yeah, so I don't think there's anything wrong with a friendship breakup. It can definitely hurt a lot sometimes done. Yeah. I mean, I'm definitely happy some bad friendship breakups, but we both had some really significant like hurtful. Yeah friendship, but see I feel like when when you can just be honest with somebody and say like we're not vibing anymore. I feel like that's different than like when you start bringing in like a lot of like other experiences of  How many's are bringing like petty stuff like, you know with text and other it when other people start getting brought into it. That's not really a healthy. Yeah, you know, I feel like most of your friendship breakups have been more of like that hard break where it's just been like some things that happened. Yeah, it's just kind of driven y'all apart. Yeah, but I've had like kind of both so I had kind of a friendship breakup and like my senior year of high school like but probably before my senior year with a group of friends that I had since like sixth grade. Yeah, and it was totally just like no hard.  Is that all it was just they were going in One Direction? I was kind of going into other. Yeah, and we just didn't hang out as much and then that turned into like well when you don't hang out as much you don't necessarily think about them as much as sad as that sounds but it's just like true. That's just life. So we just kind of stopped hanging out. I guess that was a friendship breakup. We're still very like cordial cordial. Yeah. We still talk like I thought upon their story sometimes stuff like that, but it's not they're still all best friends which just which was hard for me for a little while that  Felt like I was the odd one out, but at the same time I wasn't really about what they were about during that time. So it was like something that needed to happen. So friendship breakup usually need to happen. Yeah and see I liked what you said about like still like talking and cordial because I mean, I definitely have some people I've been friends with that if I see them, I don't I don't speak just because of like things I've done to me, but I do have some people in my life that I just kind of like faded out with but we still like slide up on stories or like I'll ask how they're doing if I see them out. I'm not going to be rude and not  To them, but I think there's a difference between like being you know, you know what I mean? Like you can still be cordial say hi to people in public, but that doesn't mean you have to go out of your way. Especially if that person was toxic to you and a point of your life. Like don't keep inviting toxic people back into your life. Yeah. What was your first friendship breakup kind of like labels attics? I mean, I had like a group of friends. I mentioned it last podcast. I had a group of friends are like really mean to me in middle school and I'm actually like, okay but like almost all of them now, but they were really mean to me and that was  Kind of hard because like you said like having a group but these girls were like mean to me and having a group of people against you is harder than just one person. But I had like I definitely have had two friends that I was friends with like a very extended period of time and it just they weren't good friendships like it's looking back. It's good that it ended because it wasn't a good friendship for me and I've had a lot of friends in the past that just haven't treated me well and I think in the past year, I've really realized like I'm I don't want to like sound conceited. I feel like I'm a good friend to a lot of  And sometimes people aren't to me hold up. Let it go ahead and speak on your behalf. You were a really good friend. Like you only have to speak for yourself on that. I can speak even friends for - yeah, where's your like him? He's awesome. I tried to be like a good friend and stuff because I feel I'm a type to you. I talked about the last episode. I really care about people and like I try to treat my friend like they're my family. So when I have people like I've had people in the past just not treat me like I've had friends like call me stupid and like but not  Like in a joking way like you're so dumb like just that kind of stuff like every day and then like calling me like, you know, making fun of my makeup for my hair or like close like friends. Don't do that. You know, there's a difference between like helping a friend out by giving them advice. But like when you start just making fun of them, that's not okay and your friend of all people should like nobody should treat you like that. Especially not your best friend, you know, so and I think the important takeaway from that is that  Does friendship breakups needs to happen? Yeah, and I think you can we can safely say that for all your friendship breakup Slim's like a good thing. Ultimately. Yeah and the same for mine. So like we said earlier friendship breakups have such a negative connotation, but they nine times out of ten or 99 times out of a hundred almost need to happen like they happen for a reason even my so I've basically had to Friendship breakups. I would say the first one was that very like amicable like friend group that just kind of faded out.  The other was kind of going into college in that one kind of hurt a little bit more because it wasn't as just kind of fading out but it again like needed to happen in hindsight because we had a great friendship like in high school and stuff. We were vibing. It was awesome, but I just kind of  I'm not you know, like I'm not the type of person who can call you every day really reach out if you have a busy life. Yeah, I mean everybody has a busy life I get that but I'm definitely the person who lives where I'm at. Like, I definitely am very conscious of living in the moment. That's so like corny and stuff, but it was really hard for me to stay in touch with them every single day. Yeah, you know and that's kind of what they needed and what they wanted for us to like be as even as we like live on other sides of the country. So I think it  Have necessary for us to fade out and maybe not in the way that it did happen. But it definitely needed to happen ultimate like over. Yeah. Yeah, so I think that friendship breakups almost always I would say our positive thing for you in the long run even though they like hurt in the short run. Yeah. See, I don't have I don't have any like person. I've had a falling out with this point my life. I don't miss any of them. Like I have it. I have one a year ago and I have not once said, oh my gosh, I really miss that person.  Owen and I feel like it's because I've got hurt a lot like the past five years. So when somebody hurts me, I'm just like we're done like I'm not going to keep doing this to myself and I told you that lunch today like I've gotten to the point where like if you hurt me once you do something like really bad, I'm done. Like I'm and I don't know if that's like me just being unhealthy, you're like, you know, I understand like forgiveness and all that and like actually have like a fight with a friend. She's probably listening. But like I love you we had a fight and then we both look realize how dumb it was. I'm gonna apologize and we're good now, we're like great friends, but see that kind of stuff like I honestly did miss her and that's the only  And that I've had that I actually missed ya. But other than that, I mean, I really haven't said oh my gosh, if we miss that person like yeah, we had fun at that time and I'll admit that like, yeah, I can admit that. I had a friend in high school and we had so much fun together for so many years and it was great, but we would not get along now like you said like we're not in the same. Yeah half. I guess what I was going to say, like we said you don't really miss them like, yeah, I miss the times that we had but that's just not the dynamic of that. Our friendship was anymore. You know what I'm saying? So like we  Had some great times and I would do it all over again. But like I know the state that we would be in today. If we didn't like kind of go our separate ways would be much more volatile and much worse. If we had decided to just kind of like try to still be besties. You know, I'm saying. Yeah, I agree with that. And I mean, I guess I'm just saying I don't miss like those people and maybe that just shows how badly I was treated because you know, everybody misses her old friends, but when you were treated so badly that you  Anything about that friendship with a person that just has a lot. Yeah yours were definitely a lot. Yeah tougher like yeah. I don't want to be a trigger word like emotionally abuse wise like they definitely emotionally abused you which yeah, it's really hard for me as like another friend or like a different part of the puzzle pieces to kind of watch. Yeah, like I'm never telling you like certain things and like I told tons of my friends like oh this is going on and my friends like why are you still friends with this person? And it wouldn't even just be like your friends and be like your best friend. Yeah.  Stuff. Yeah. Oh yeah. This is like ride-or-die best friend, you know and I feel like for a long time. I've been that one person that's always had like one best friend too. And then after like that first best friend hurt me, I was like, oh my gosh, I don't want to have just one best friend because like when you stop being friends with your best friend, sometimes you like isolated yourself and I feel like that happened in high school. I feel like I was friends with this one person. Yeah, and then like I didn't talk to you. There's like a year. We like barely talk like we recorded all we were not friends, but I feel like I missed out on like a lot of like times with my other friends because I was so  Focus on this one friend and then when we stopped being friends was like, oh now I have like nobody and for from like my perspective when I would want to do stuff or like hang out with you during that time, it always felt like y'all were packaged deal because you are that guess, you know, and if I wanted to hang out with you, I would have to hang out with you and such and such and I didn't really Vibe with this D and I thought the opposite I thought y'all died more than we did. Yeah, but you know what I'm saying? Like it's in that ended up like  Us hanging out with us because I didn't really want to surround myself with that energy of the a person so then I wouldn't surround myself with you as much which was kind of sad. Yeah. So when we say we're like best friends for forever sweetheart. Yeah, but there's definitely been like ups and downs. Yeah, and I think we've done a lot more closer look in the past year and leave we've literally even had fights, you know, or not fights but like like we've had times yeah where it's like, hey, what the heck dude? Yeah and like had little scuffles, but I don't think either of us have like changed.  Directions enough for us to have to have a friendship breakup. You know I'm saying no, but say that something did happen and like we were just totally off the wall sticker and just like didn't have the same values and just like yeah, what's also I think it helps because we don't live in the same place anymore. So it's not like I'm like, I mean, I don't know how to put that I get what you're saying though, like you're not down my throat all the time and like we don't have to like but it's like I mean, I don't care what you do it off. But like I care what you do I worry about you know,  Like are we don't have to have the same like values in like ideas of fun and that kind of stuff because we don't even live in the same place. So I feel like it doesn't really look when you're with people and like I mean that becomes a problem see if you have different values with somebody because you know, it makes hanging out harder. If you don't enjoy doing one thing and then somebody else does you don't usually don't get invited and I'm that friend that doesn't get invited to stuff it maybe not even maybe values was the wrong word but like things that you prioritize. Yeah, so say that okay, even though we don't live in the same place.  Us every time we were both home at the same time you wanted to go to the park and like run. I'm a I don't know. We're maybe we're not hang out with me. Actually, that would be you. Yeah, I would be yeah say that I just wanted to run every time I wanted to hang out with you. Yeah, like maybe we wouldn't be as close friends anymore. No, and that's maybe not a friendship breakup, but definitely kind of fading out that could have been a yeah, and it's like give and take you know, if I feel like another important thing with friendships is if you know, you have to compromise on some things, you know, yeah compromises.  Porta it and listen to you talk about your YouTube all anyway, anyway, no, I'm just saying like compromise is important because you  say no to Jewel. Sorry. We just all go Julia move like say no to Joel guys. But anyways, where was I going with that? I totally forgot. Hold on. So, how did you like deal with your friendship breakup? How did you like cope with not having that person with you 24/7 anymore. I think for me. I started reaching out to  I mean, I know it sounds really bad and I hate when people do it to me, but honestly have like a lot of friends over there for me when the first one happened that I feel like I got closer to a lot more people that I wasn't friends with because of that person. So I wasn't allowed to be friends with certain people because they didn't like that certain person. But now some of the friends I found during that time like my best friend's today and we still hang out every time I come home. So I feel like definitely like reaching out to other people and honestly, I want your opinion on blocking because in my opinion, okay, and my and my  Opinion. I feel like if you have a toxic person who's coming back into your life every six months like this person was for me and saying they want to meet up and like have closure and all that when that's like that becomes toxic when that person keeps re-entering her life and eventually you just have to block. Okay, but see for me, I don't see blocking his Petty. I see it as you know it honestly, I don't block people on Instagram really more unless I don't want them to contact and but honestly like I'm Doin great mine screams on public now go check it out. See my great pictures like I guess.  See, this is a hot take yeah, you're very like like walking is so petty it's not no, I don't see it as pet night. No, I'm the same way as you like. Sometimes you need that. You know, there have been times in my life. I don't think I've ever done. This was like a friendship breakup where I just don't need to see somebody for a little while and for me, it's more of a temporary thing. Like eventually I will unblock you but like I don't need to see right now because I get upset every single time. I look at you because you've done some things are like really fucked up to me. You know I'm saying. Yeah, so I don't think that blocking is petty at  All unless I mean it definitely can be if we get an argument and I block you or like unsure you have done that we're friends too and I'll admit it. Yeah, that's not the best but like if you're genuinely like okay cutting someone off from your life because they really messed you up then like that's totally fine. You don't have you shouldn't have to put yourself through seeing them like we live in an age like when everything is in your face all the time. Yeah, and in the past people don't have to really deal with that because if you wanted to cut somebody out of your life you just a boy. Yeah.  I just don't see them. But now you really can't do that unless you block so blocking is fine. Yeah, but I get what I like what you said about like rooting yourself in other relationships, like maybe relationships that you couldn't have had before mine is always been a little different because I think both of my friendship breakups were very much like I had other friends and that's kind of why we ended up kind of going our separate ways because I found like people that were either like closer to me or that I vibed with more  So it was never that hard for me to kind of get through. I guess it was really hard because I love those people a lot. But at the same time I had people that I love that were already. Yeah, very you still haven't established. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah don't like what she said about like bringing in new people, especially when you said people that you like quote-unquote weren't allowed to see before. Oh, yeah, because that was a big thing for you. I'm remembering that now like they had Beast with this person and if you talk to them you're portraying  Them and stuff like that and that's so high school is so toxic if somebody told me because I definitely still have friends. I don't Vibe together or and I was like thinking about my birthday and I was like, I don't know. I don't want people to like, I don't want any drama on my birthday this year, but honestly just want all my friends together. Like that's all I want for my birthday. I don't even want gifts. Like I just want to have a fun day with all my friends, but I know that I have certain friends. I don't get along anymore and it was like really hurt my heart if like somebody didn't come because they don't want to see somebody or like  That's really common problem for people like getting together groups of people because of like Pepsi. I feel like yeah, I've tried to stay friends with everybody and like honestly if somebody told me to like not be friends with somebody right now like at this point in my life, honestly, there's people I don't talk to really because they've hurt my best friend's like but I'm not gonna not talk to somebody because I think it's different when you're like real life, you know, we just gotta know this to I'm not I would say that you're probably like one like my number one best friend. Yeah, and I'm not going to tell you who to be friends with even if it's somebody  I don't know like who has done me wrong. I like that. I don't like I'm not gonna and I feel like it's I think it's very high school to and honestly like me hanging out with somebody doesn't really like effect as we go to different colleges. Yeah, so I just don't understand that invite whoever you want your birthday girl and if they don't want to be together then have to come now and that's just like a sign of what kind of friend they are. Yeah, that's just like one thing and it's just like hard having people like  From different friend groups, I guess you could say because I'm always nervous like even in high school like when I did like dinners and stuff. I feel like my was a senior year senior year was a good dinner because I had like everybody there - one person I didn't want their but anyway, isn't it? I just thought one person. I had everybody there that I loved and like cared about me, but I feel like junior year or like I think my sweet 16 was good, but I just feel like I have so many different Post in high school. Like I had been banned friends. I had like Deca people and I had like you like the OG group, but I'm always nervous.  About like everybody getting together. I don't know why I guess I wasn't my type too. Like if everybody can have a good time and like yeah, you care more about them even though it's your day. Yeah. So messed up Ali don't know so basically back to like we're yeah we're our behalf. So the way that we would say deal with friendship breakups this you just have to as simple as it sounds find more people to reach or something and I think that it's really important to not jump to another number one Vesti like especially with your situation but more like  Like root yourself in a bunch of different people because I remember I don't want to speak for your experience. But kind of from that though. I want I want your outside. Yeah from the outside looking in it was like you had one number one Rider die best friend and y'all had like a friendship breakup. And then you were like trying to fill that void with somebody that could be exactly that but number one best friend all the time every sure and that kind of got you in another bad situation. Yeah, but God made the same like mistake. Yeah. It's almost like a rebound like  We were here and we were comparing like romantic relationships different relationships. And it's the same thing like you can't it's a friendship. You can't try to find somebody that's going to fit that mold to fill the void. You just need to like close the void and yeah have you know, or fill it with tons of different people like every single one of my friendships, I think offers a different thing died need as a person that kind of fills me up. It's about yeah, absolutely. So in short like just find people to  best in the end that are going to pour into you because that's kind of what you need when you go through a friend break up for sure for sure right Lawson. Well, I want to thank you for talking about this with me because like I said, I recorded like a whole episode and then I'm I'm not posting it because I was like, oh no not doing that. But I feel like you rot like an outside perspective. Yeah that I needed because I think I still like if you talk about some your situations it might seem like you're throw-in shade. Yeah, where's if I talk about it. It's more of like a totally objective just like  What I'm looking the truth. Yeah, no tea, it's just that that should be the name of this episode. No teeth. No but seriously friendship breakups are hard. They're like are just as hard as romantic breakups, but I think what we kind of came to we were talking about this is that it's always necessary and always for the good in the long run. We also kind of embrace it when it happens. Don't try to make it happen. Like every time you have a disagreement with you know, don't just cut somebody. Yeah. Oh my gosh. No.  But there's definitely situations where it needs to happen in the way to overcome that Ali kind of talked about. It's just like richer self and other people. Yes. Wow. Thank you Austin, of course. Thanks for having me on the podcast follow us on Instagram at rad name Lawson be Smith. It's not an underscore underscore. Oh my gosh, very cute. I like it.

Yeah, they clear them to eastery. Oh, absolutely. I was always the same time since I've been here like they must not clear the ones in front of Elliot or like when you're walking like it's the same tense in the same spots available for the record. Do you see a fucking sucks for not like providing permanent housing for those people true? Yeah. How did you find your housing them deadly? Yeah. Well like I'm saying comprehensively like yeah few people can get housing. But if we still have a chronic issue he's going to have an in the benches at they're making like slanted like pudding.  It's terrible. If you're not going to do something to help them go back. Oh, fuck you mayor Bowser, really?  That's anyway. Well Trump fuck would vote for Trump tweeted to Nancy Pelosi was like how about you focus on your own homeless written District, but veg his motorcade goes outside and look out the window.

Sorry, but no it turns into a - okay. Well she has HIV for her. It should be metal for men.  No, but yeah, that's her room. She wasn't in there. So we said God we're going to visit a fish and then we just never came back, but I feel like women don't need it quite as much. Yeah, you know what though? You never you never know, but like it's just like if you if you do if you do engage with multiple hookups, and yeah, but also meant to be wearing condoms anyways for ya.  pregnancy test  Pregnancy that crap probably plan B Plan B. Oh that hasn't happened in front of my house find a way to cheat the system and buy weed with G world. Yes. Whoa bulk. So if you want $30 you buy $30 worth of batteries or whatever. Then you walk to the CVS next to Elliot return return it the receipts take cash when you're paired. You will do the suit Steakhouse.  So the other CBS will go to the receivables take cash and they'll give you cash for something. You just bought off the street. So what's like, do you rotate? Yeah, like literally money if you buy something from from CVS, but not with G World. They just say do you want cash back?  For your video? Yeah, and I would know but I think they're stipulations because I can't get past backwards. You will know what you were on give me the point is to use your gyro. Yeah, that aren't cute. Oh Tina. How did you not catch on to that? Well, I did only use our well, you can put money from your Jus rolled onto a gift card and then use it like at Starbucks or something. What do you got the gift cards to CVS know like you go to a Starbucks like hot obviously wanted to write that. Did you want to put money aside to Starbucks Leaf weed? Exactly. Honestly, this is this podcast  Many of you just because DW kids are going to want to hack their way through humor true. We should make an episode. We see relax just on GW. I know what I saw a girl post. She did a quiz it was like, what do you want a federal like service for G world? Yes, I would no, I'd rather want G world. I know but oh like I would kill trees but it's hard when like what?  Yeah, yeah, like I'm not gonna put it in the bank like it's just going to stay there until I have to get back to some way to the bank. It takes two days. It takes literally free to my podcast.  Money, but will it cost me four guys to move them up or 25 cents to move the money. So by the time I even make 25 cents so rude you just get too excited. Yeah, like lizards are parachuting a famous like two years after she did that song, but I'm so sorry. I feel bad.  Oh, it's my dad's. Okay. Anyway, I was thinking today. If you I don't know if you know.  And you want to know why well, it's because she's American.  The cdc's British mafias Gonna Get Us. No guys. I'm like, there's probably so many spies among us. We are spies Among Us. Have you guys talked about the mob? What mob any mile true you brought it up.   New nose. Do you miss it? Yeah. Have you ever been no talks about all the time. You've been to Kalahari once and it was  Is Golf Course or was Golf Course Kalahari by re-scope course and put Kalahari on it. Oh, yeah, that's like four minutes. Don't that's okay. Wait, where do you live money? And I'm in Scranton. What's that? Like 45 minutes does everyone just talk about the office when I think you're frustrated? Yes. I really like no one instagram talks about the office ever. But luckily the first thing that like people mentioned to me is like, oh, you know Michael Scott, do you watch the office like to know what the offices know, okay that Honesty but like me.  Absolutely Quahog Family Guys talking like it's really so gray. So like that like the coal area or not. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That was our third grade trip to the you know, like everything in third grade.  No, no, I'm buying cars. I think it was not too hard, but look far enough where like they have like the cyclical Bird. That's the core Lackawanna like 100 - yeah, or oh my God. They're also like a forever burning is no like a coal. Mine. That's was burning underground that's in Central PA. Yeah, Centralia, Centralia, Pennsylvania. It's all graffitied. Yeah, like it's kind of just gonna burn forever. It's good. Yeah, the streets are deserted.  You got dessert because it's really burning under the front. It was like a coal mine like Pennsylvania just felt like all of the underground that's it is like a lot of sinkholes in PA, but like the coal mine just like sort of burning like oil in there or whatever like spews out. You can see look at look seems that we've been no but like oh, can you visit now? I've never I don't honestly don't know anybody who's been there.  We should go this summer and it's like far from where we live. It's over two hours on like a not worth it to go to a call. It's like the Midwest or not Midwest Western Gold not know what it's it's the cultures of each place. That's just weird because we had the same look like two counties in Maryland and the rest of Maryland. I've never met  Yeah, the first was in Pittsburgh. I was like 15. Yeah, like that's no reason if it's for guys or no. No, it's fine. I hate Western Pennsylvania anything about it. So it's like okay. It's like the North in like the easiest like Phillies like its own thing the like the Northeast is like its own thing. I was Eerie. I don't know like everything. Yeah. Yeah doesn't talk about areas. Well, there's everything in the middle. That's just like farmland and like the Amish and then there's the awesome. I love my mom is  Success with the Amish like absolutely Harrisburg in like, what's the harm?  What what?  Maybe okay. Everybody got selected skroob on I can't stand them. Yeah, please do I'm sorry Joe but like a enough. Yeah, but only the gays Jose. Okay. Well then what do ya know? She's not I like warm milk, and she's she's less radical than Sanders.  Yay.  You know what after a certain point you just can't know that I feel like Warren is like Sanders like she just adopted all of his policy initiatives, but then Justin apologize were she needs to it's not really like a good but she's also more polish that pretty like plans on Instagram and but that's like she's just literally soon policy initiative some centers and just like that. She's a woman  Uneducated liberal women also what do you want to notice here? Well, I know she was a really yeah, but I don't feel like we have to support issue into DW that she's a woman. What am I saying? Yeah. I like Kim. I support many for ideas to like, he's really I was so happy. I was so happy when she drunk. I don't know. I like her. I think that Camaro  really conduct. She never had a message other than yes, I think my mom is as Republican and she said she would it wouldn't be half as bad as if Donald Trump.  I acted like I don't know these terrible. Yeah, but look, if you at least like spoke more eloquently or like acted like an actual figure if God would will to like support his ideas instead of just like yelling. Mmm. Gonna do a hot tip for a second. Yeah. I'm not mad at Trump at all for he didn't Iran really not at all. That is hot. Like I think like like what he did and he kind of worked. It was like with understand like that guy.  cause some sort of maybe is like what are the worst people in the world like his initiatives or the past 20 years have taken every single country in the Middle East and started Civil War like Libya Yemen, Syria, Lebanon are all under Civil War because his government led by custom swimming had this initiative of supporting like Rogue militant terrorist groups to rebel against their governments and he's been doing this to start like  Topples over regimes everywhere for the past two years. I like Trump made the assessment that like killing him won't have a very bad retaliation from Iran and he was right honesty, but I when people were like exaggerating they like, this is World War 3. Iran is not capable of any like no stating a fact. No, they don't there's no bomb coming to DC no bomb to New York. So they do not have the capacity to do that. The only thing that you have the capacities, but they did like, yeah, what's that called six hours before it happens?  We're gonna bomb one of your league. Yeah, no one died. No one died. Honestly, it would have been worse if they killed soldiers at the bases and then Trump real Unity only problem I have with it is like the timing of it all like no one is talking about his impeachment at all. And now that is so sketchy because keep and the same thing happened with Clinton like so the traffic like accused Obama of trying to do that. Yeah now he's literally doing it. Yeah, but  I think it's like one like it's a good part of History. I like this guy was killed and we'll cuz now talking political unrest like attacking my overthrow Iran would yeah, that's really anyone's government has caused so much turmoil in the Middle East. Yeah. I've supported in every single this. Yeah, their citizens are very sick of division. Yeah.   Thank you. Thank you, and it was an educated more just like but not everyone goes to school for.  I don't know that much about International politics. I really needed to I and I'm an international. Yeah, I only know so much. So why did you drop a lot of that drop out of yeah, let's go give International poli-sci is really close to IA. Right? So like for me it was kind of like one of the other because I wanted to pick up the fireman's for Elliot are ridiculous. They are the Communists horns are not too bad, but  There are interesting but like the class A lot of the classes are going to be taking our like Ivan. There's a sister clasper. That's like the same side class just under a different designations or it's like you're literally like PSC ones or three and I am yeah. Yeah and you couldn't use one or the other for like both mediums you can you can't but it's like I wanted to pick up philosophy. So okay one of these are going to go there's some really similar. Anyways, I'm going to drop one. Yeah, so then it was just about like which one is going to allow me to do more because I really don't know what I want to do.  Right, I can get into the national affairs with a poli-sci background, but I can't get into mainstream probably sign with International. Yeah. Well, I'm thinking minoring just because like we have to take so many poli-sci class has anyways, and also I'm interested in it, too. Yeah, and if you value though, I was gonna double concentrate in Environmental Studies and internationally con, but I realized that if I want to minor in geography like Cameron, I had have to drop something and I didn't feel like I do want to catch up.  Yeah, I do but I feel like I wouldn't be able to catch up because GW does a lot more different things than when I took it in high school because even know what I have slopes or something. I don't know something in contemporary cultures and societies and you're also French major. Yes I'm going to do is a with that concentration French and then what was it that they were almost in the me and they finally did but I almost said and that's know.  Jersey like kind of have to let me and he was like, all right, if I must like sign this form and then I'm going to put him in a minor in anthropology. Like I used to I love like unconventional Majors. Like I really do like we don't need a million Anthropologist, but we do need to have some anthropologists. So not everyone does it it's fine. I like we definitely need Baristas so that philosophy majors.  You'll be the best. We need you after leading the Iranian Revolution. You really could.  Connick I'm did it. Oh my God absolutely go off. That's really impressive. Thank you. Yeah.  I've been taking Italian on Dual window. Oh my god. I've been I jumped into the Chinese watch of the placement test last May and I skipped Chinese one and when attorneys to wow, but like I had a entrance exam today. I probably got like a 40 and the woman was like you can have a lot of catching up to do so be prepared to put in a lot of work. Holy shit.  Long question. Oh my God, some also taking Spanish this semester she acts like I'm just used to talking Spanish within a school in language. Like if I just talking foreign language is Spanish, right? So she asked me a question in Chinese. I understood like most of it and I literally go see what she's like. Oh like you didn't take Chinese Yuan right you're joining Chinese food, and I was like see.  That's funny. And then yeah, it shows you like get the fuck. She kept asking me questions.  Sounds like this is like not raise. Look I don't understand how like it's like tonal right like you'd like to talk to you about where that even sounds like. I never but it's like there's the same work it out multiple different mean. Yeah. It was about working the same songs, like backboard. No, no my father. Yeah, this is Chinese and the guy was like you just said boobs in Chinese. I was like, of course you did. Yeah of all people.  boobs and Chinese babies  I prayed for my period to come on guys everybody split up Boomer period it was two and a half weeks like every muzzle. That was the length of it. I think that's good lassitude. Yeah every single time she got it.  Yes.  But I kind of thought were like I can skip my period so like if you look if you know, like I'm birth control like the last model of like a fake the last it gives you it's not actually a sugar pill.  Yeah, yeah. Yeah.  Constipation constipation. Yeah, I feel for some women what constipation like if when you're when you're like trying to come talk to yourself because sometimes you don't know it just feels like your muscles tightening in your stomach. But on your uterus, that's like what I had when I go have dinner and then I go exercise. Yeah, it's like that as well.  For me, I got it back pain. So like I can't sit in your leg or something. It's not like that kind of crazy.  Heat on it I get sharp pains.  Can you go swimming? Yeah, okay. Yeah, you put attention or not or that your the water stops. It actually stops it like it like makes like a weird sexual but the second you get out of like spills. I have a story. I love the human body. So um, I was at Busch Gardens. It's a water inlet so worried. I know I was at a yeah, it's a water park and at the a park and oh wait. No we were Water Country. So sorry. It's like the water park next to it and my friend from  Turkey came for a month and we like took her there and she didn't have her period for like a month, you know, and like she was afraid of no she didn't have her period for two months. So she was afraid it was going to come any minute and right after one of the rides you could see like the water was like turning red like dripping down her leg Jaws. Yeah. I mean, I guess I haven't seen Jaws so we had to like run her to the bathroom because it was like getting darker and darker.  I have a I have a water park grade and it was are like class Retreat and I do not want to go swimming by do not put a tampon in. So you just did I was in the bathroom of my friends were outside the door now like lift your leg to the right like full your me instructions for what Temple has. Oh my God, and I didn't put it in writing.  I know also vaginal cups. Oh my cousin use those ya we have a friend. Oh, yeah, they're good. They're good for the environment. Yeah, don't name her. Yeah. No, but from here that has it. He is. Yeah, there is also a vegan so off it goes. Yeah, but I feel like you have a story for everything. I'm sorry about veganism. I was as I was vegetarian for two years and I was vegan for like six months after that.  Two months that's good. I don't know how buffalo chicken wings. I'm supposedly vegetarian right now. So that's good. We'll see I was vegan then I became a d mix so I didn't know Dairy because I'm lactose intolerant though. I went to a plant-based restaurant yesterday. And yum. So my brother he got a coffee. He's like, can I have milk in there? Like, okay. Do you want Oak milk hemp milk oat milk, not out Oak.  worst toys  And a good enough to weird, but I just appreciate their food. How you doing Peter? I see his girls moving.

This is gonna be my thoughts on the Sundial activity after playing it for a while. It's the central activity in season of dawn thought we should do a video on it. If you're listening to this on iTunes Google play Spotify or watching on YouTube. You can always catch me live at say no to rage.com if you're watching on YouTube hit like subscribe in the belly button helps me out. So the Sundial discussions going to Central around a couple of things like the central point of what I want to talk about is the good the better and the unknown and the reason  I need a kind of phrase it this way is we're not all the way done with the activity. There are new things coming in the season there's new bosses. There's new mode. There's lots of things. We haven't really experienced yet. So this is sort of a preliminary discussion about the good it looks like things are going to get better. They've structured some cool things. You might not even be aware of if you haven't looked for them. There's different things in the game right now, you can take advantage of if you are enjoying the Sun Dial and grinding for the weapons are some good things you can do there's things you can do with the  Obelisks as well as we had somebody in the community go crazy on the season pass and get really high ranked. If you guys are familiar with Chevy he did that for Science, and we now know some other things so I'm just gonna open up with the good because I actually do enjoy the activity. A lot of people were overly I think have been overly critical of it. The community seems to be enjoying it player base numbers are seem to be fine and and Menagerie was a hit. So I think more menageries a good call. I think it brings the value of the Menagerie with  The non failable you can just match make in there. And since it's not failable. It's okay for them to make things kind of intense. If you go in there match made some of the activities might be kind of frustrating if people aren't doing their jobs, you really want to make sure at least some people are running Unstoppable. I like running an Unstoppable bow, and I'm in there those Unstoppable guys can be pretty pesky and then anti barrier as well. That's I think when people are probably going to get the most irritated as if they match make and nobody's running anti barrier or Unstoppable and you're the only one trying  Saying that those those enemies can be a bit of a headache but the Silver Lining is that it's not failable. You can't fail the activity. You can get all the way to the end regardless of how it goes and that's good for hardcore players as well. We were going in there and it was taking us anywhere from you know, 12 to like 14 minutes to complete a run. We know we're gone pretty hardcore. We're going pretty organized. Everybody's kind of doing their jobs and there's you know, it is new mechanics if you haven't played it yet. If you're familiar with Gears of War there's  Like a hammer of dawn mechanic in the one fight that I thought was really really cool people. Hopefully aren't missing that if you're not paying attention and your buddies are doing all the damage to the boss. You might be missing that there's a really really cool mechanic in the one boss fight that I like. I thought it was a cool new thing that was going on. And if you're a hardcore player that's Spectrum works I think is if you go hard and you're organized you complete it quicker, you're getting more drops more efficiently. If you're more casual and you just matchmaking you're not the contents.  Held at arm's length from you. You don't have to grind and get leveled up for it. You can just play and get guns and it's set up really really nicely and it's attached to another grind with the obelisks. Now, we've had people come in and say I don't like the fact that I have to go run patrols were gather resources or do law sectors or public events. You know, why do I need to do all this stuff? I like that. They segmented the grind the fact that I can go and do the obelisks and Ewing the obelisks has a benefit in the game and has a benefit on the planet and  it has benefits tied to the actual Sundial activity itself. And if you're going to compare the Sundial to the Vex offensive, I do like that the encounters are not as simple and as easy as the Vex offencive, I wouldn't necessarily call the Sundial hard, but it's certainly a lot more challenging than Vex offensive was especially with the presence of some of those Champions. I find the Unstoppable guys to be the most annoying because they're constantly knocking you back and bouncing you around and I just got one of the new things.  Day on the artifact. This is another nice feature of the game is you have different different bills and things that come out but I have this one here if I staggered Ensemble Champion, it's going to temporarily boost weapon damage for Allied players. I'm anxious to try that out and just see how quickly we can get rid of those guys because they can become pretty annoying and pretty pesky. So in light of what I was just talking about with the obelisks and making things better. Let's talk about the better. We talked about the good the better. I do think this activity in the is showing itself to be one that will get better.  As you progress through the season I made the mistake of leveling up the Tangled Shore Obelisk. I would focus all your attention on Mars Mars once fully upgraded to level 11 will give you double drops when you get to the end of a sundial run so you can run those obelisks and get those, you know, those increase in drops. The one that I did on Tangled Shore is one that you get I believe I believe it's level 11. I'm sorry 12 on the season pass permanently increase the capacity of  Nia Sundial links by one what this is doing is eventually you're going to have all the sundials connected to all I'm sorry all the obelisks connected to the Sundial. So anytime you end it you can pick any of the rewards. You don't have to like do the do the duty of like I gotta go to the you know, I got to go to the planet and you know connect the Sundial and then she's gonna get some point where they can all be connected. And the other thing that's going on with this is that that is making your grind in the actual Sundial more lucrative as time goes on I've  I still made the observation that I am a little concerned that the the obelisks have bounties or frames. I'm sorry weapon frames that may be quicker than running the Sundial once all four obelisks are completely leveled up that currency the fractal 'in the fractal lean Harvest Polar Ice crackling. You're not gonna need that anymore once all the Obelisk or fully leveled up and you can buy the frames from the obelisks. Some people have pushed back and said well, but low know you could grab those and complete them.  While doing the Sundial and getting multiple drops at the end of every Sundial really maximizing your potential roles that you get here's another permanently increase the number of remaining rewards from the sun dial by one you get that at 32. So by the time it's all said and done you can be ending a sundial with multiple drops. And if you're doing the frames from the obelisks, you can really really increase the likelihood of you getting your God roles. And there's one more thing that thank you Chevy from redeem for doing this. He went crazy. He leveled his season pass up all the way.  292 to see what this was we had the theory here that it was going to be like the augmented frames from Ada. It was just gonna be an extra perk in that last slot and that's exactly what it is. So you're not you're not getting like a different version of the gun. It's just at the final perk Lane, like if you look at a gun and that final perk Lane always has one perk so I'll give an example on the steel feather right now. It's osmosis and there's nothing else you actually have to in that lane to choose from and that mathematically increases the likelihood of you getting a god role.  Then you're increasing the chances of getting the perk combinations that you want. Maybe you're looking for vorpal. Maybe you're looking for osmosis. Whatever it is. You're looking for having that at their actually helps. So you have to think of it in this way as the season progresses, you're increasing the amount of drops you get and the drops them selves are also improving as long as you're being, you know weekly and you know doing your bounties leveling up the season pass and leveling up the obelisks. The actual activity itself will get better with time.  Time and I think that's exactly how you should craft a limited time event by the end of the season the hardcore players looking for the absolute. Best of the best. God rolls are some really great weapons in there and some good roles some new perks and things that we haven't even had before and those players will be empowered to really chase the absolute best role or the role that they want because the activity gets better over time. Now this all leads to some question marks. Okay. We don't know again if the frames are going to be  A lucrative and faster taking the frames into the Sundial activity or just a sundial activity itself. So lastly I want to end with the unknown there are some unknown things here at the gist of it at the beginning here. My impression of the Sundial is they were really really thoughtful about how it's going to feel to progress through the season and how it's going to be to chase God roles. But here are the things that we don't know. What will the new bosses bring are. They going to change anything that's significantly do they have specific drops do they do they change the fight? So the modifiers change in accordance with them?  You know does does the encounters leading up to the boss change because the boss is different. We don't know what the bosses are going to bring as the presence. What's hard mode going to do we have no idea. Why is it only Legend? You know, it's only Legend. What's the power level going to be? Is there a reason to even run Hard Mode? What's the impetus is their loot. Is there a reason to run it hard mode Menagerie just was horrible and there is no real reason to run it other than the swords and even that I don't think was a strong enough motivator to go in there and put up with the Deltas in the challenge. So those are some question marks, you know.  And next season. How are these guns going to be cycled back in next season? We don't know what's going on with the Vex offensive weapons. Some of the weapons from the Sundial are really really nice. There's going to be an obelisk in the tower. Maybe we'll be able to continue to get them as frames. Maybe that Obelisk will stay in the tower. We don't know anything beyond hard mode. Are there any difficulties be on hard mode? There's a Triumph that says to beat a certain boss at Legend difficulty or higher now is that generic text they slap on everything that was just kind of there as a placeholder and they never went back and change it or does that  I mean there's a mode Beyond Legend. Is there a is there anything beyond the hard mode? That's launching in January? What about the armor is just going to be a good role, you know a good place to go for stats the stats on the armor are getting higher the further you get in the season pass. What about the armor that drops in the Sundial mode? What about the arm of the drops in the hard mode of Sundial is it going to have better stats is going to have better stat Trends and then you know, are they going to be any Sundial mods? You know the charge with light mods of the main reason to go toward the new armor sets this season, but are you going to do  Anything with mods for the Sundial to make us run it more effectively. Now, they didn't do mods for facts offensive. So that's an unlikely thing. But those are the handful of question marks I have about the event overall. I think the activity is good. It's something fun to go and do and it's going to get more rewarding with time already right now. I think it is pretty rewarding and pretty fun for that seasonal activity. That's match-made and non failable as always we're going to move to question answer if you're listening design. I choose to play Spotify you're watching on YouTube.

So I'm going to give you my CliffsNotes. I think it's clear that trials is very close to returning that placeholder was put there either on purpose or I think maybe because it's coming back this season. A lot of people don't think it is. I happen to think there wouldn't be a whole lot of reason to bring real crafty and dr. Lupo out to bungee in December. They wouldn't be playing and grinding and trying to get weapons and trying to practice if it wasn't if it was coming.  Back in the spring that seems all a little bit preliminary like really early. So I think it's coming back this season. I mean, that's why it popped up. I even think it might be called Trials of saint-14. So Geritol. Thank you so much for thirty three months. You're the best and then sunbro. I think I think you for six months. Welcome back.  Tian muggle low-riding help. How do I get for weapons linked to the Sundial? Well, you need to have two connections available. So you need to be need level 12 on the season pass or you left the level up tangled Shore. So I would think you got to pick one. I would say go for level 12 on the season pass and then level up Mars to get extra rewards. Then you can have two links which is for weapons double.  You 33 how do you feel about the reward output for Sundial? I feel that defensive had more upfront rewards via the chest, but the sundials have a lot more quality to them.  Well, I think because they knew.  Vex offensive was likely to be the thinnest version of a seasonal activity that they give us. I think they said you know what we better give people tons of rewards. That's what I would think they would need to do as a progressive as a progression you got the first season comes out and Vex defensive is a total throw away. Not like it's a piece of nothing ultimately was very simplistic. Not a lot to it.  Well make it really generous. So at least people are going in there because stuffs dropping like crazy in comes the Sundial more complex. It's like the Menagerie there's more to it a big step up from the menageries. You don't the run from activity to activity. They just warp you back and then you run out. I like that a lot. And so  If you do the obelisks as the season progresses and you're grabbing the frames and you get the thing fully upgraded, I actually think this is going to be better because it's a little bit more intentional you would end Vex offensive and you could pick one particular frame to have done. Everything else was totally random that dropped so I actually think this is better. It's just gonna take some time for that snowball to get going.  But I do I do think the activity by and large is a lot better on the surface. I just think they wanted Vex offensive to feel like stuff was raining on you because the activity itself wasn't that great London Bates Lord. I'm having trouble farming the currency to upgrade my obelisks. I think it's called Polar Ice crackling fully upgraded my Mars Obelisk and I still don't get any drops after Crucible match played 25 games and nothing. Here's the thing Eugene is going to resonate with you on this. He was doing some testing as well. He is come to a  conclusion that that perk is broken. It doesn't seem to be having any effect at all. I think I ran five or seven strikes and got to drop like twice. It just doesn't seem to actually work. So you have to wait for the weeklies to start to roll over. There's other sources of fractally no, okay, all three characters should be doing their weeklies on both obelisks. So that's for weeklies per character.  That's 12 total weeklies. If you do all three characters and both obelisks weeklies tomorrow on reset the 17th of December, they'll be more obelisks and more weeklies and subsequently more fractal lean. The other thing you can do in the interim while you're waiting for reset is do all the Milestones on all three characters at the Sundial the sundials. Milestone will give you a hundred fractal in per character. Also, make sure you go in and cash in your triumphs. There are triumphs for  Season that give you varying degrees of fractal mm. Eventually, I think you do hit a wall where they don't want you to be getting a ton of it rolling over every single week.  Because I think they Envision it being one Obelisk a week. If you're dedicating all of your time and resources that you get to one particular Obelisk that means for about a month. You're slowly getting every single one unlocked to somebody that really goes after it maybe three weeks but in general I would say most people are going to take four weeks to get all four obelisks completely leveled up. I think that's totally fine. I don't think they're meant to be like a hop on that day go crazy.  Get all you know, get it all done. So before reset tomorrow, I gave you a handful of things you could check and try but other than that, I think they've got it Pace that way on purpose.  Big Daddy Patty with three months. Thank you. Morphe says do you think there's a problem with how armor is treated each season each time. They go away and are useless after the season. I get this question virtually every QA. I think you're misunderstanding. The seasonal armor is still important. If you're going to run Garden of Salvation or nightmare hunts those mods slots matter and are super helpful. If you're going to go run Leviathan the mod slots on the Leviathan armor are  All and helpful, so I don't think they're invalidating all of your armor at the same time. They have to incentivize you to chase the new stuff. I don't think people always realize what they're asking for if the season of Don armor that you grinded for never needed replaced. That's a significant amount of loot every season that doesn't matter to you at all. And if it was just purely an ornamental grind you would literally get armor to drop and then you'd be done you just like I'm done with that activity. I you know, I got it.  Those mods slots matter. It just sucks needed to grind for new armor for the new slots at the proper Affinity in each season. That's no fun. I still think they should allow you to change the Affinity. Once you level of a piece of armor to level 10 one time. Okay, just once because I do feel you on that aspect you could get a pair of gauntlets and you're like, yep. These are the right stat trends that I like. These are the lights lights that roles that I want. You take the time to grind for the materials level at thing.  And changes Affinity one time and then you're good to go. I don't think we need to segment the armor grind that freaking much to where you're like, I finally got the stat roles that I want, but it's the wrong Affinity. I you know what I'm saying? So like I think that's the biggest risk with the setup. Now, is there demotivating people from really wanting to chase armor because there's too many barriers between you and getting what you want because you have to think Eugene's like, oh, it's not that hard to get decent status.  Tribution, that's not the point. If you're going to motivate hardcores with the men maxing opportunity. They're going to want really good stat roles. They're going to want greats that rolls and I was grinding the dungeon and the raid every week to get my drops and I was never getting anything that that was that impressive. So Bungie has to think about that then and even if you're going to say, well the marginal difference between something with good stat distribution. That is 58 and something that is 65 with terrible.  A distribution that's the real issue right is it's not stat total it stat distribution because if you don't care about mobility and you get something that's a 65 but it's got you know 15 on Mobility. It doesn't matter. That's basically a 42 you you know, so you can have something in the 50s with better stat distribution. I would say in general the issue that people have with armor is they have a particular bill they want to go for and that's the  main hang-up is oh I this is a really good stat role, but it's the wrong affinity and then that kind of that's kind of a bit of a hang-up. You can't say that in one breath. You can't say. Oh, it doesn't really matter just get decent stats. It has a marginal influence on your Loadout. Okay, you can't say that in one breath. And then in the next breath act like the armor grinds got to be arduous and painful and slow if the benefits are marginal then who gives a Frick if I finally  God roll pair of galoshes or boots or something and I take the time and resources to take it to level 10. Let me change the Affinity one time at that point again. I think people push back on this with a contradiction in their argumentation. They say, oh, well, it doesn't really matter. You can go with a decent stat distribution in the mid-50s high 50s. Just wait for the right Affinity. You can't say that the difference is between a 55 and 65 according to the stat distribution is marginal like it has marginal influence over.  For your Loadout if it's so marginal than why hold it at Bay. Like why not let people get what they want. I do think the armor grind needs to evolve a little bit. I think bungee focused on the internal mechanism of the armor leveling it up perks rolls Etc. And I think they didn't think beyond that very far with well, how am I going to grind for the one that I want? And then what are they going to do in the spring if we spend this entire season going?  Todd roles they have the charge with light mod slot. What are they going to do in the next season, you know where they going to go from there? Because right now I don't even feel like I don't even care about charged with light. I'm I care out of curiosity but it's not like when I started getting mods for the raid or mods for nightmare hunts that change the flow of those fights and it changed my power structure. That's the big question I have is is charged with light even that great. And then what are you gonna do in the next season?  Even to make me Chase armor. This is a situation that I think bungee needs to figure out. Now the trick could be the trick could be with the ornamental system. I don't know again if you want to say just run the new activity. And as long as you get a pair of boots, as long as you get five of the arm pieces of drop, you're basically done with the armor grind because they would just be Universal ornaments. I think that would be a danger. I think they could do something with the armor drops and the activity for you, too.  Unlock that as an option. So then you're like, well, I'm not really chasing the drop itself, but I'm chasing the ability to have that armor and apply it to what I'm presently wearing. I think there's a significant danger there and saying once you get all the armor, you're done you'll up. I'm done it their all ornaments now. Well, that's not really a grind is it it doesn't take very long and short order you'll have full armor sets, you know.  Short order it'll take long. So that that that's a concern that I've had. I mentioned this when they announced armor 2.0 and when they announced Shadow Keith, that's what I said scalability is my big question mark you can create great systems. You can create new incentives new perks new grinds new activities. That's all we know bungee can do that. Is it scalable? Am I going to Care in the spring for that new armor? And how are you going to get me to care? Because in one swing you can't say none of the new armor matters and  The next Wing you can't say all the old armor doesn't matter because the seasons are too close together. They're kind of having to walk a tightrope here of your old stuff still matters as well as I want to chase the new stuff too. And I don't quite this is one of the first times I struggle with an answer and a solution because it really is difficult. If you're purely chasing Cosmetics. We're kind of going back to Destiny to year one where the only reason for you to go to NASA saw Rio and grind for the armor set.  It was because of how it looked not because it did anything particular to your gameplay. So I actually don't exactly know what the solution would be. Other than maybe if you grind the activity enough and you get enough armor drops, the more you take that armor and break it down the more you get a currency or something for Infusion that can be used to upgrade old armor. So imagine there's a there's new armor sets in the  Season and if you grind for enough of those boots, then you break them down and you plug that into your current boots. You're unlocking the the mod slot for That season, you know over time and then when you're done doing that it also then unlocks the ability for you to use it as an ornament or something. I don't know.  Beer pie do you think bungee will start to lean more into mechanics doing damage for bosses now with the introduction of the hammer of dawn as you call it. I would like to see some fights take it a step further and have a mechanic to do say 1/3 of the damage to the boss. It's after repeated three times. This will give us something to do other than DPS boss fights.  This strikes at the heart of a discussion. We've had many times where I've said. You don't want every fight to feel like oryx. I think there's a time and a place for fights like oryx where you can't beat it any faster than the then the other than the other team, right? It's just make the bombs detonate the bombs make the bombs detonate the bombs you do that four times and then he dies you can stack the bombs and that does shave off some time, but in general if I don't  Too many fights to be like oryx. Could there be more fights like that? Yes, first things first. You gotta knock off his shield with hammer a dawn then after you do that maybe something else. Maybe you got to get swords. Maybe you got to get Scorch cans. Maybe you gotta get him to you know, step on a plate like ignites the floor. I don't know like there could be other things like that. I think the biggest barrier between bungee making stuff like that and and not is that stuff tends to  you belong in a raid as soon as you start asking match made people to start doing something that requires Synergy or timing. It's going to break down really freaking fast and Menagerie as Luke Smith indicated one of his director's cut they teach you in a menagerie visually what you're supposed to do. You don't need instructions. You don't need a directions. You don't need arrows on the ground. It's just kind of a visual. It's a visual learning process. I think that  That limits how much they can require of a team.  I would say a lot of what they had is doing Garden of Salvation was a good pivot into Synergy and timing especially with the challenges and stuff Synergy timing, you know mechanics stuff like that. They did a they did a good job of making it to where you got to do things together as a team and time things so that it's not just a DPS bake. You also have to admit that had Garden of salvation.  Your two major damage phases the harpy going down the hallway and the big boss going up in the sky.  Those are very short windows of damage. So the Harvey going down the hallway is challenging. You gotta have pretty good aim. And then the guy going up in the sky again. You've got to you got to have a solid solid team hitting they're hitting their shots. Because if not, you're going to you're going to run out. Hang on. I got to let my wife know low on creamer. I didn't realize she was going out to the stores. She sent me a picture.  asparagus so I would say that mechanics are always a fine fine like line that they can't go too far overboard with  if they go too far overboard with the mechanics, then it breaks down. It just it does it breaks down go into Menagerie with a team that doesn't know what the frick they're doing and it can be frustrating and the in the mechanics of Menagerie are really straight are really really straightforward. So they're always having a straddle that line of  We don't want things to be mundane and just bake but we also don't want to be so complex that engagement breaks down and and and doesn't go. Well, this is why.  I believe they could take the philosophy and the principle of Menagerie and Sundial and apply it in a variety of ways right now. If you really Blitz these activities in Sundial you get to the end quicker right? I'm a sweet cream guy Charlie whiskey giggity you get there quicker, right? And I appreciate that aspect. But what I would do is if I was bungee, let's just imagine the one with the hammer of dawn.  That attack room. Okay, I think when you Blitz it and you get it done really really well. There's like let three or four guys come out. Okay. What if every time another one comes out it gets harder more difficult or different or more things are required of you. All right. Number one that's going to give satisfaction to the synergize team. Yes, we pull it off. It's so much harder when you get to the fourth Voss, but to the team that's matchmaking if they're falling.  In a part of the seams and they only got like the first of the second boss Beat. There's no harm or foul. They the time runs out and they go to the next area. That's where I think bungee needs to dig in there at that level and say can we make each encounter change and get more complex the further you get so then we could start to turn up the dial of if you make it to phase 4, it's really complex, but it's well worth it. Maybe you get a drop. Maybe you get a random drop if you if you get that done now.  A lot of times the push back here, which is probably valid people say if you add extra drops or extra loot incentive for going that distance, then people are going to quit if they're with a bad team. They're going to get angry. I'm like, oh my gosh, we could have gotten an extra drop here, but these frickin numbskulls over here don't know what they're doing. I'm out of here and and toxicity goes up. I don't know if if maybe  If maybe the loot incentive is always a danger because that leads to high quick ratios when you're with a bad team maybe instead of that you get a really really big jump like jolt to your imagine. It takes you to different encounters to get to the end. You have the encounter with a hammer of Dawn and then you have the encounter with the the bomb slamming you grow grab the bombs and you bring them back and you slam them but you know, if you can beat the much more challenging and complex.  Fourth boss at the hammer of Dawn and counter if you know that's going to shorten the next encounter that's worth it.  If it gives you this multiplier or something, so the next encounter is cut in half then you're like that's good for the Hardcore team, right? You're getting to the end faster. You're not necessarily getting more drops from a quality standpoint, but you are over time because now you're beating the sundial in 10 minutes every clip and that's increased drop rates at six drops an hour. That's more than the guys that are matchmaking. I would just always grow concerned about that is number one.  If you get if it's too complex teams fall apart engagement goes down. That's not good for the game. If you have incentives for reward and loot tied to playing really really well. Then quit ratios go high toxicity goes up and those more casual players end up feeling like they can't play with anybody because maybe they don't, you know, maybe they don't understand it and it all has to be in Balance because if not, you lose one side of the community. I think he'll try to cater the game way too hard to casuals and don't incentivize the endgame activities.  As actually difficult I think what you're saying is not accurate post Shadow key post Shadow keep what you're saying is completely inaccurate if you look at 9:59 any night falls and the 959 any nightmare hunts. I think you're wrong. I think there's lots of stuff in the game and then you go to the dungeon, there's and the garden of Salvation raid and the challenges for garden of Salvation. None of that stuff is catered to the casuals the bulk of the content and Spectrum in Shadow. Keep was not for casual players.  At all now, there's a difference between giving casuals and entry point and accessibility and making things casual for them. That is why the structure in Menagerie and Sundial is so brilliant. No one can claim you're keeping it at arm's length. I can't get the stuff. That's not true. It's not even failable and then the hardcores can be like dude. We are cranking through the Sundial every 15 minutes. It's going really really fast and we've leveled up our obelisks and we've level of our season past and weave  got a got these extra things and so it's faster and it's more rewarding and more drops and more perks for the hardcore players. So it's cocked Iraq five of the time loss frames have Guardian kills as one of the random objectives to complete for a drop. Do you think it was a good idea to have PVP objectives as possibilities from the obelisks or should have been more intentional and not included it is always weird.  To get a bounty that isn't from Shacks that tells me to go to The Crucible. I'm generally just going to delete that. I'm not going to do that. I'm not gonna do that. I'm not going to go into Crucible for a bounty when I can run the Sundial really really quickly, especially near the end of the season and get multiple drops. You're not going to see me taking a frame Into The Crucible. I'll just frickin delete it especially think of it like this.  We did the math and once all four obelisks are leveled up. If you do your weeklies and your Sundial Milestones on all three characters, you're going to end the week with like 2700 of the fractal lean and it's like 10 fractal lean to buy a frame. So the only reason to have fractal in at that point is to buy frames and if you get a frame that's going to take you to The Crucible. You're probably just going to delete it. It's only ten fractally. That's probably what a lot of people are in up doing.  Next question is from Pescador de muerte.  How should a limited time player maximize the grind in season of dawn every week take care of your Obelisk weeklies and your Sundial milestones and just anytime you're doing anything be grabbing bounties and then you'll be leveling up your season pass your artifact and you'll be getting better drops and more drops from Sundial as the season goes on. So I wouldn't it I wouldn't ignore the obelisks and the weeklies or the Sundial milestone.  Arcanist while I understand bungee needs to incentivize us to chase the new armor with new mod slots every season. There's really no great way to get good stat rolls on the seasonal armor. How do you think bungee can address this?  I don't honestly know what the answer here is.  Like when you grind for a gun, okay, there's a different grind that's going on there because you want three perks that work together.  And when you're grinding first at rolls on Armor, you're looking for numbers in a lane that's going to contribute to your overall build. So it's not as it's not as like singular. I guess nine months from now Wheezy. Thank you.  As a PVP player I respect you wanting to get us some quality of life instead of just telling us to go freak ourselves and play another game. Thanks for having our back. Oh, yeah. I tweeted at the other day about that would've been a good Improvement for the PVP guys.  It's more singular. It's like this gun is either good or it's not and with armor It's just tough. It's like this pair of boots might be bad for your build but good for another in general a bad roll on a gun. It's not that subjective. If you get hip fire grip on a sniper and I don't know something else. That just isn't going to help you then. You're no one's going to like, well, that's great for my build. Maybe not I mean Justin,  Hands, so most of the time though a bad role on a gun isn't that subjective? You just you get perks that don't do much for you, you know, like head Seeker people think head Seekers great, but it's really not it doesn't do anything. So, I don't know how you give us intentionality towards something that is so minut but when stacked up when stacked up all those stats on all those individual armor pieces adds up to a greater whole there's there's  more to it than just a perk on a gun.  Sorry, I had to take a drink of water.  so  I don't I don't know how to give you intentionality there because if you're like, I just want tons of recovery and discipline and they give you tons of intentionality there.  I think the danger would be you're going to get maxed out tears in discipline and intellect and Recovery.  And then the danger would be you now never ever need to go for anything else ever again. And that's the thing with guns. Right? We got a bunch of God roll guns, but now there's new guns. Now, there's new perks. There's new things for you to chase that you didn't have before and I think that is one of the things I that that helps it feel fresh and new with guns every season. They can throw in just a couple of things. They throw in just a Coppola perks and a new grenade type and all of a sudden were like we're in there. We're in there grinding and  Totals just aren't as interesting. So once you get really good stat rolls is going to be really hard to motivate you to chase new armor.  But you can add perks of the season pass an increase your stat totals like have Perks it increased at of energy capacity on the season pass armor. They already have Perks it increase your stat totals though. They have six of them. They have intellect discipline in strength, and then they have recovery mobility and resilience and already exists there already are perks that do that there already are mods do that. Now if you're feeling about perks on the armor itself.  Now you're getting into more layers of complexity. Now, you're going to need two layers of complexity that has the armor has Affinity the armor has 6th at totals and the armor has perks that can randomly role. That might be too much.  Dark seraphim. Do you think the amount of fractal lean drops from Sundial is too low or is it appropriate for that level? Is there possibility of increasing I think it's fine. We kind of address this a little bit ago. We dress has a little bit ago. It is a  it seems to be structured to where if you really push for it. You're maximizing one Obelisk a week. And I think that's totally fine. Oh you're talking about season pass perks.  I don't know. Yeah, maybe there's a difference between losing an oppressive Darkness mod and you losing like 20 discipline just cuz I don't know, that'd be weird right you'd structure all your armor you'd get set and then all the sudden you just lose a bunch of stats one season into the next. I don't know Anakin Starkiller with 34 month. So close to three years. Welcome back.  Dr. Cleveland, do you feel the level 92 in the season pass unlock an extra perk for your weapon drop is a test for weapons 2.0 update is this in line with your thoughts about how weapons can be updated in the future? I do not think that's what it is. This has been in place since the black Armory a year ago Ada had augmented weapons that just an extra perk was just in that slot. It pulled from the same perk pool. It was just an extra option. So you're like, oh I didn't get out la Kill clip. Oh wait. Yes. I did one of those is like an  Something it just increases it just increases the likelihood of you getting a god roll. That's all Eugene says, no, no a perk in the season pass that would increase the potential stat role of your armor drops for the entire rest of the season. It wouldn't go away.  Oh, so the season pass would affect my drops not affect my stat totals.  I mean I could see that they have all those perks that you unlock at the bottom and they could have won that like I don't know as the season goes on near the end. It's like oh your armor can now drop with you know, an extra ten total stats, you know.  I don't know. It's one of those things where I do think I don't think necessarily bungee quite knows how they want to do it just yet because  if they it's one of those things I'm telling you if they give us too much control, we're all going to get God to your stats and then you're never gonna want to take that armor off right now the this is weird to say but the benefit of me not getting any great stat roles in season of the undying is that if I get something new that's a little bit better. It's really really easy to put it on and invest in it. The only reason this is the thing to that's kind of weird. The only reason I was leveling up my armor.  During season of the undying is so I could put perks on mods on them.  Because I wanted to run Nightmare hunt mods. I wanted to run my mods to that gave me increased reload or increased recovery or whatever. That was. The only reason I was leveling up my armor. I was leveling up any of my armor because I was like, oh, this is a god roll. This is a god roll piece right here. I wasn't doing that. I 100% was not looking at any of my pieces and saying this is an absolute God roll. I got to take this with me in the next season. I got a really level this one up with I just wasn't so I'm not really sure if they're going to want to give you intentionality.  I think they're gonna want to give you intentionality over the guns because it's more clear if a gun is good or not. It's way more subjective. If you get God to your armor stats to what you're trying to build and if they give you too much too many God rolls that's gonna be really really hard to motivate you The Following Season unless they do something kind of arbitrary like they did this season where they said there's these new mods charged with light and you can't even try them out if you don't get new armor.  r  Yo, yo G mitsui says what do you think about there not being a raid this season. Do you think the new dotting seasonal content matches up to the cost without the motivation of a new raid Pinnacle activity? I think it's fine. I think people overstate the value of a raid. I also think for $10 expecting a raid in addition to everything else. They did is is just not really in line. I got people that are going nuts on my YouTube to like you  You state every time that it's only ten dollars. That's not a good enough excuse low know and it's like the one guy said nobody asked for this. We didn't ask for ten dollars Seasons every couple of months.  Really because the player base numbers seem to say otherwise and the old way of doing things with the droughts was terrible like was what was terrible going to going back to the way we did it before you spent 60 for the base game and then 30 for the DLC season pass for Osiris and wore mine. I don't I don't know why anybody would want to go back to Osiris warmind or House of wolves? Dark below. I don't know why you'd want to go back to that.  I think if you look at the structure of the game where we had like kings fall and then nothing or rise of iron and then nothing and you compare it to this system that we have now, I think for $10 we're getting exactly what we've all grown and accustomed to love which is a hobbyist live service game.  That always has something going on and I think that I think that's a really really good good system. I think it's working well, and I don't know what's going on with the tracking though. The tracking of the player base numbers is like glitched. It says there's like a hundred thousand players online right now just on PC. Okay. They've Dave's erode them out. Yeah, the the tracking over the weekend was glitched. It was like there's 89,000 players presently on PC, but then it said that only  Thousand and played the previous day and I'm like that that can't be right there can't be that many people playing right now at this moment. And then that's the number of people that played yesterday. That's like that's like mathematically impossible. That would mean that only those people logged in and played and then they don't nobody play for the rest of the day. I think when bungees been doing their background maintenance where they've been disabling API access and some of those third-party programs and dim and stuff. I think that's probably messing with the player tracking.  Ng  Cassie's article ran with your trials of saint-14 idea. Did he say anything about me or is he just I'm not the one that I don't think it's original to me. I think other people have said it snow Ravens. Do you think the Pinnacle grind is over with level increase each season? I just don't care about it. I don't know. It just doesn't seem to matter.  I don't need to now I've Legend drops, and we suddenly feel the need to level sure. But by the time Legend gets here. We're going to have padded numbers pretty significantly padded numbers from the from the artifact. I'm already like a plus 6 almost a plus 7 and that's after a week 15 months from insane Dutch. Thank you.  So I don't I don't know what they're going to really do with leveling. I'm fine with it going away.  Just let us play and grind for gear every season and the season pass in the artifact can give you your sense of leveling and progress dad bod United maybe asking for advice. I fell in love with D2 around curse really found myself with the itch to play again. I picked up all the DLC and I've been loving my time back in the game. I'm feeling overwhelmed with where to start and what to do because I've been away so long I find myself jumping in and just ending up in strikes a crucible any advice on how to tackle Quest objectives. Should I pick a planet and go  Where would I start? I mean this is a really specific question, but I wouldn't be surprised. If a lot of people feel this way like yeah, I took a break and I came back and I don't really know where to set my sights. Like there's there's so much A lot of times too much too much content can make people feel a sense of futility and that sense of futility and almost like helplessness. You just sort of lock up and you're just going with what's familiar what I would say if you have season of Dawn I would set my sights.  Sights on Osiris and play through that stuff with him. He has a story mission that he doesn't really promote. You got to go like talk to him and you go and you interact with saint-14 I would do that before tomorrows reset because there's going to be another version does he like another story Mission probably this coming week and then the other thing I would do is I would just go to the Tangled Shore and Mars and work on the obelisks do their weeklies get that fractal lean stuff cash in your triumphs spend that fractal lean. I would focus on doing the Mars one first.  And you can always do what I call round robin. If you just if you just wanted some pretty like laid back easy breezy content that benefits you go to every planet starting with the EDC and just go around robbing go easy go easy. Then you go to tighten. Then you go to Mars. Then I owe then Mercury then nessus you just kind of go around in a circle.  and you grab the bounties from the NPC on that planet, there's only three and do them all and if you do that with another person and you get the bone, you know the bonuses from XP or whatever, you'll move your artifact and your and your and your season path along at a pretty good clip and  That's something else to do that that also gives you a benefit leveling up your season pass in your artifact is also a benefit and then you can always just grind the Sundial once you get your obelisks kind of level up and they're connected you can grind the Sundial and try and get some good guns from there.  Have you heard that twitch has been sued by three billion dollars what I mean by three billion dollars mean for three billion, who are they being sued by the piper? Would you entertain the idea that the wish Ender bug is bungee playing around with buffing bows and tracking Community strong response to them. I don't think so.  I don't think so. I would think that.  It's just well, maybe they went in and try to tweak a perk or something and it fiddled with something. I don't know. I mean maybe that maybe they were fiddling with the perk and they they over fiddled.  It's possible. It's possible that they were like, hey.  You know, it's possible. They were fiddling with something and trying to like quietly help bows. And it did they kind of did it by accidents? It's supposed to on Livestream fail and what they're sued for I've not heard about it. So if you feel like putting some of the details in chat, I've not heard about twitch being sued for three billion dollars. This is what the frick vertov. What is Destiny needs going into D3 that makes them in game we  One I believe things like the obelisks are great ideas that need to be living more in different ways make it I'm this is not a question filthy. Do you think having such potential influential seasonal mods in an overall pot as an overall positive for the current grind between inventory woes and time spent grinding undying armor. I personally find myself caring much less this season 4 mods that that will still be not be usable on new armor in three months.   I don't know. I mean they definitely need to I think they need to think this through because I definitely see where you're coming from. Like if every season were like well we gotta get new armor. Now, I think that can be a little bit frustrating. Maybe there's something that we do every season to upgrade that armor slot kind of how we said like leveling could be slot related. There could be something thats related to the slot itself and we just grind for the armor cosmetically I just  Now if that's the right call a Russian Media company for pirated streams of league matches. Oh, it's a suit in Russia about a soccer game. Well, it sounds like it sounds like people have been using twitch for you know, probably showing stuff. They're not supposed to show which gives Credence to what I've been saying for a while now twitch should not let any old person just stream. I believe you should have to go through an application process if you're going to stream on their platform because it's not like you'd see  where you upload the video and there can be a process in the background that checks the video for its legitimacy or copyright material just to protect YouTube. You can go live on Twitch and go unnoticed for X number of hours sometimes streaming so that you have no business streaming like you could literally do a prop up brand-new brand-new stream and Streamlight copyrighted movies and then all your buddies could then go download them from that from that vaad like that.  This programs let you do that so Twitches got to think about that. You can't just let people live stream and because again if they don't put themselves in a directory, there's a lot of things that could go into them, you know, doing stuff like streaming soccer games and stuff and you just again, you just don't put yourself in the directory and tell all your buddies and you kind of share your pay-per-view with them like that. They've got to think through that stuff Ashton Hollow. What what what would you say to people who say Destiny has turned into nothing more than a bounty checklist as  more seems to be the only way to progress this seems like a pretty uh, pretty shallow criticism. I think there's a lot more going on in the game. You don't just do bounties bounties are complementary to what you're already doing. So I'm going to go run strikes. I can grab bounties while I'm doing strikes if I'm going to run the Sundial I can grab bounties while I'm doing that now there is a bounty drive when you want to currency and I think that's okay. I think there's something satisfying about grounding a bounty getting the check mark getting the stuff.  On the Bounty as opposed to just as I've said many many times if you just sit there and run the the Sundial all day every day and nothing else you're going to get. I really I really think you're going to get bored like really really fast and that would be my largest concern about not segmenting it so bounties and things that seem more more menial and more tedious. I think are a really good way to change things up a little bit so that  These aren't complementary to those of us who do mostly rating right, but that's kind of if you're if you as a player are going to come and engage with an admittedly very small slice of the game. That's more on you than bungee. Like they can't give you like a thousand raids, you know, they if like, well, I just really like running strikes Crucible or raise whatever if you pick a small slice of the game and that's all you do. It's it's not really fair to then turn. I'm like, well, it's just nothing but a bow  He checklist. It's like are you doing any of the other things in the game are did you grind for the rituals? Are you doing Sundial? Are you leveling up the obelisks? Are you doing just like the round-robin like I do just to change things up to level your artifact in your season pass like you know mean they can give you about is I can complete in raids.  Oh, I see what you're saying. They're not complimentary if you're just running rates because there aren't enough bounties for raids that Harkens back to a suggestion that I've had for. I think since yes since Benedict showed up with Leviathan, I have been saying we need a raid NPC that I can level up by running raids. So if you run more than three that week you can get more experience and level up that NPC they could have bounties they could have ghost sparrow and ornaments.  That are earned within that season for running that raid like crazy. It would've been pretty dope to run Garden of Salvation extra times for extra XP and you know have some dailies and repeatable is on there. And then when you're doing that you're getting further and so let's say at the end of season of the undying you get a raid NPC rank of 80 and you get a bunch of cool stuff because of that and your guns look different your raid guns, your radar more looks different because of the ornaments that you got from that.  Great NPC I still think I still think we need to raid NPC now Eugene's making a pretty good point a pretty good push back. You can grab the raid challenge bounties. Well, not for a garden. There wasn't a real challenge many but there's a raid Clan Bounty gunsmith bounties can be completed in the raid. The Vex offensive bounties were completed in the raid. There was actually quite a few boundaries you could do while in the raid now, but there are trade bounties. I think that's kind of the point. I think a raid NPC  Be a nice upgrade for raid Grinders it number one. It'd be a really easy way for Bungie to say hey, there's now A Reason to Run The Raid more than three times and it's sort of external from the ray of the not that going in like Tinker with drops or fiddle with rate itself. Just do it externally with an NPC beer pie. How would you feel if Master working seasonal armor during the season would unlock it for you for ornamental use it would give an incentive a Masterwork armor.  So you're saying if I Masterwork the seasonal armor during the season it would unlock it as an ornament. This is kind of what I was getting out a little bit ago like the idea that if you take the time to do something particular with the armor, maybe you unlock it as an ornaments. I don't dislike this idea. I grow concerned about space in the database of the game like from a technological standpoint. We're going to get really really bloated with ornaments.  Now maybe bungee could do something where you go into collections and you can only have so many ornaments active. So you've got to like, okay. I want like you have your five how would they even do this? You have like five boxes and you go to those boxes and say I want these ornaments to be active for helmet Gauntlet, you know, you'd go to helmet and say I want these ornaments active like I'm gonna be switching between these ones. I kind of like these ones. I don't know I think  Would I think he would start to run into a bit of a bloat a bloat problem with with the ornaments there are already a lot in there because they just kind of gave us the ones from the ever verse which was a nice gesture, but it did it did fill up the the ornament section pretty pretty quickly and the other the other concern I have on the back end of this.  Is your you're running the risk of turning armor grind into a purely cosmetic Chase and I'm always hesitant to endorse that because that didn't work in D2 is launched and I know DTS launch was really thin. So maybe I'm picking an extreme version of chasing chasing Cosmetics, but if you're only chasing armor because it's pretty  My question would then be when are you chasing stats? When are you chasing armor for a particular for a particular reason? So Trey says first time you are already have me hooked. How do you feel about the seasons ritual weapons? How easy or difficult? I think it's nice that they're not that difficult Bunji. I got this question another time and bungee feels like they want to meet the One season to feel front heavy because if they're front heavy that's when most people play most people are playing that.  Tweak that first month and if that first weekend month feel really really fun and rewarding for the Lion Share the community.  Then I would say that that's a good thing. Oh, man, I spent $10 and you know, I hit it pretty heavy there for a couple weeks and it was fun. I got some new stuff and you come back every season kind of anticipating that front heavy feeling it's weird to have like a front heavy season and then say hey these cool new weapons we offered. There aren't a lot of new weapons and just in a few of the ones that we did offer out of the out of the very small that we did offer. It's gonna take you like the whole season to get do you see  I'm saying I get where people are coming from because they're like dude it took me the entire season to get the not forgotten. It's like you're all your awesome. You're cool man that that was an achievement. I didn't get that. I didn't get that freaking gun good for you, but that doesn't mean that needs to be the way that it is every single time.  Perhaps Perhaps bungee could look into like an ornamental system for the rituals. There's only three of them and so maybe that would be like when you went from you got your Luna's house and you went for the not forgotten you could get your your ritual weapon. And then the long grind for the more hardcore would be unlocking an ornament or something. That would be that would be my first initial idea maybe  I do like the fact they make the seasons front heavy. I think that does the game in the community. It serves them well to have it be front heavy.  I also think they've swung the pendulum really hard. So you have people that are like you got to be kidding me. I spent the entire season trying to get Randy's and now people are getting this other one really really quickly. Yeah, okay, but, you know Randy's compared to a side armor or the linear Fusion. You know what I mean? I I think they're I think ritual weapons are falling right into the lane that they're supposed to fall into their  Kind of like I don't want to use the word gimmick, but they're just like a unique kind of fun weapon that isn't it. It's not you're not grinding for the recluse or the or the not forgotten anymore. It's just change its moved away from that. Listen, they've admitted that Pinnacle weapons as a concept created lots of problems, which then means they're probably evolving out of the game. And this is their way of evolving them out of the game. They're just going to call them.  Well every season they're going to be neat. They're not going to be unique in their perk roles because other guns can get those perks and they're not going to be that particularly hard to get and I don't I wouldn't call that a mistake or a problem. I would say that's just kind of the Natural Evolution of them saying you know what this was a huge problem and we can't do this anymore and a way to slowly boil that frog in the water is to slowly like take down how great they are and how hard they are to get and they're just there.  Rhythmic injection of stuff that you got free activities. You got rituals. You got a new activity. You got a season pass you got an artifact. There's kind of all these things that are dropping. You know, when you think we'll see old ruins return September of next year King boxer. Not sure if someone asked this yet, but was Osiris not having daily bounties a missed opportunity Seasons, not over yet. We don't know what Saints bringing so I don't want to say it's a missed opportunity.  Next we don't know exactly what's going to happen. Also Osiris brings with him for obelisks that will if our assumptions are correct will be eight weeklies per character Smoky dailies do seem to be missing but we'll see Smokey gaming since the obelisks are free to everyone. Would you necessarily mean that they wouldn't leave after the season Paul Tassie seems to think it doesn't have a seasonal symbol. Just curious what you think. I like where Paul's heads at. I didn't look at the  The obelisks are 100% going away at the end of the season because they are tied to the sun dial. Their purpose does is it needed after the Sundial is expired but but the towers getting one and when we went to light Gigi, every single frame has an obelisk planet and then they all every single one of them also can be gotten at the tower Obelisk according to the database which I believe that means the tower Obelisk may just in  Endure so you if you didn't get the frame you wanted you can always just hit up the frame and the tower spring season. It'll still be there and there are three that can only be gotten at the tower Obelisk the can be gotten on the planets. It's the to it's the sniper from the season pass the rocket from the season pass and the perfect Paradox. They don't have a plan an obelisk. But the rest of the weapons that do have a plan of the Obelisk also all can be gotten at the tower according to the database. So it's likely  The tower Obelisk sticks around and the planetary ones are don't because the planetary ones are the ones that you connect to the Sundial. I don't know if we're going to be connecting the tower one to the Sundial want to wait and see I think we're going to be doing that. This week was saint-14 during the daunting.  Arson at dawn. Are you a fan of bonuses being did I skip a question there? No, I didn't. Okay, are you fan of bonuses being added to the season pass that can alter the guns given the season I'm a fan of the double perk final column of the saint-14 Armory, but dang It's a Grind to get to rank 92 if I want ample time to get the better versions. You have to understand that. It's not a better version It's a mathematical probability increase right now.  You might say no. No. No, it's a better version because I can switch between two perks depending on the encounter. Okay? Sure. Yeah. Okay, you get one with vorpal and you get one with osmosis maybe there's times where you want to do that but I would argue that the guns themselves aren't that much better and and it doesn't take that long to get to the to a hundred. It does it and we have a longer season than we did was season of the undying so the people that care about that.  Thing about a gun with an extra perk are hardcore players more than likely and they're going to be logging in enough. I would think to hit a hundred within a reasonable time frame to get that benefit of the Season couldn't you argue that's pay-to-win content what's pay-to-win content? You have to elaborate. There's nothing pay to win the game presently because pay to win means you buy something that gives you an in-game advantage like a really God roll shotgunner our hand Cannon.  Thing imagine saint-14 shotgun with demo trench or 1/2. So now the shotgun fulfills roles based on my class choice. So yeah, they're okay. That's true Eugene. There are potentials for double God rolls again. I think we'll all if you care about that if you care about that Eugene, I would think you and anybody else like you is gonna hit 92  at a pretty at a pretty reasonable clip throughout the season. I mean not everybody is going to do what Chevy did because Chevy's a mad lad but I think I just hit 20 something tonight. I mean I'm a fifth of the way through and you know what, I mean, and it's for one week. So I think a lot of us are gonna get there pretty quickly.  Give a better chance to get a better role if you purchase a season pass by leveling up to 92. I don't really have time or patience to entertain the pay2win thing because I think the fact that you're here and typing that up. I think you're smart enough to figure that out on your own that it's not pay to win because that's not what pay-to-win is pay to win is when I go and say give me a god roll gun or a one hit kill gun that will give me a tangible measurable benefit in PvP.  Let somebody else can't get unless they spend money. That's pay to win anybody that's ever tried to argue. The season passes paid win or the Exotics on the season Pastor pay to win. Those arguments are just absolutely silly. That's the nicest way. I can say it. They're silly. If you bought if you bought dark below there were guns in there. You couldn't get without the season pass you could argue that was pay to win. So Bungie has apparently been doing pay to win since dark below because any time they've expanded the game.  And it's looped pool. You get more loot with you spend money. So I just think it's a ludicrous position. SMN says I'm kind of stuck with the obelisks. I'm level 18 on the season pass and I can only access one of the reward tiers both Mars and Tangles or obelisks are Level 4. I've yet to find any help and I'm wondering what I'm missing all three characters. If you do all your weeklies, that's a lot of weeklies and then your three milestones at the Sundial and then cash.  All your triumphs you should have enough to level one of those guys up all the way because my Mars ones at four and my Tangled Shores at 11:00. So you may be having cash in your triumphs. Maybe you haven't done the weeklies on all three characters maybe haven't done the Milestones on all three characters, but that's how I did it.  Servo actuator do you think trials will be back next season because the season of dot I think is potentially the season it's going to be trials saint-14 going to skip because we've already dealt with that a lot today Gold Heart cold heart. I'm sorry. Do you know what max level is for each Obelisk. I'm eleven on the Tangled Shore. There's no more upgrades a few can keep going. We don't know why you would need to or have to wait and see but presently nothing happens Beyond 11 that you would really want to keep dumping, you know stuff into it for thankless work. What are  Expectations for the summer season being with the described it as a time like never before in Destiny. I'm really intrigued and finding myself looking forward to it. Love your content. Thank you. I believe that Bungie will pull at many threads to come together into one thrust in the narrative toward September which will be savathun in the Dreadnought and I believe when they pull all those threads together. It's possible they will also then pull all the planets all the activities all of it together. So the summer  ER is like this it'll be like age of Triumph like the celebratory time to do anything and everything just grind City and that leads us like a crescendo to savathun in the Dreadnaught.  But that that's that's what that's the only that's the best I can do is a theory I don't think it has anything to do with the triangle shifts. I think triangle ships are tucked away as an ever-present threat in the narrative that will come into play in the next game not in Destiny to but that's these are obviously just theories. Oh, I'm sorry. Smm says, I figured it out. You have to reset them to open up both. Okay. Let me make sure this makes it into the podcast smm.  I misunderstood your question. And this was a problem that I encountered you get to the point where you can have two sundials connected to I'm sorry, I'd always say it wrong. You can have two obelisks connected to the Sundial. So when you end there's four guns to choose from okay, once you unlock the ability to do that, you have to go to one of the sundials and you have to reset all connections and then connect the two individual ones. It's a little silly, but it's the way that  At it set up. So if you've unlocked the ability to have more than one Sundial I did it again. If you've unlocked the ability to have more than one Obelisk connected to the Sundial but only one is connected. You have to reset the connections and then connect both Tangled Shore and Mars. It's kind of a have you tried turning it off and back on again situation. And that's the that's the workaround. So if you're running into that, I am sorry, I misunderstood your question. Hopefully nobody who hearing the podcasts like off Rick. I have the same problem and he doesn't understand what we're trying to.  Fix so that is how to fix that.

My initial thoughts on the Sundial activity in Destiny 2 Season of Dawn are pretty positive.  A new difficulty, new bosses, and more obelisks are on the way as well.

So as I'm recording this, it's Friday and to some people that's like the moment they wait for TGIF and like the weekend is near and I got through another week and maybe I'm going out of town. Who knows.  If you hear little noises, it's popping my baby. She's right next to me. So some of these episodes might just feature her. But yeah, Friday really doesn't mean anything to me anymore because I'm not working anymore. So time is so irrelevant time is so relative and on Wednesday. I thought it was Saturday and in the middle of the day sometimes I think it's like almost bedtime.  Sometimes I wake up and who knows my baby is like a week old. So you already know that newborns are all over the place and you just kind of go with them and try to get them to get on your side of town but time is so so so so so relative and if you're like me, sometimes you have to look up words to really understand them. I'm more so like science and math.  Math oriented and like not so much like memorizing words and that side of the brain. So relative just means like comparable. So when people say like it's all relative. It's just everyone has different opinions or different viewpoints perspectives on the matter. So time being relative is like  Some people already live as if it's their last day or their last moment or they see time as like an idea and that's what time has been for me. It's like an idea like, okay like for p.m. Cool, like I'll write that down but it really doesn't affect my day right now and in Buddhism, there's a term or phrase and it's absolute happiness versus relative happiness. So  Relative happiness is like you could win the lottery and like be happy in that moment. But then lose all that money the next day or lose the ticket and then your whole world is crashing down but absolute happiness is like no matter what happens to you. You have this happiness within and we just watched into the spider-verse. I don't even remember what day I was but a couple days ago with the kids and it was just so cute and  and that's something that Miles Morales says the time is relative and I was thinking about making this podcast a couple or this episode a couple days before watching into the spider-verse and it really is it really is just living in the moment and not really caring what day or time it is and just doing what it is that you say that you're going to do or that to-do list or  The things that we wait for like why are you waiting for Friday? Why are you waiting for the perfect moment to do stuff?  For example, I didn't really get my last four and a half weeks of pregnancy because life just ended up happening life happens and I didn't have that time to do the things on my to-do list or I still had work to do. I still had money to make I still I just, you know, we've been deep cleaning the house. That was all supposed to be done before she was here, but she came  In life didn't skip a beat for still deep cleaning the house and I was supposed to pack my hospital bag before going to the hospital, but I went to the hospital by myself and just checking if you know is this happening or is this not happening and it was and then what like the time that you thought you had isn't there. So speaking to people who are still pregnant or speaking to people who you know, they're like  I'll do that tomorrow or you know, I'll do this. Well, I didn't have that time and I didn't have tomorrow like now a baby's here. So the things that you want to insert in.  how is time relative to the things that you're trying to accomplish, you know a workout plan a diet or you know, we're over halfway through the year now, but  What are the things that you're just putting off like even the little things that I'm like, you know what I'll just do this tomorrow, especially not having a job now. It's like I have that luxury of like mmm. I'll just fold this pile of laundry tomorrow, but what if it doesn't come like what if something happens to where I can't come back here for a while or who knows like the possibilities are endless, but time is so important to be in the moment and to be here.  for now  So I'm not telling you that being late to work is like something that you should adopt or a hobby or something that you know, you're just on your own schedule and making everybody else revolve around you, but I'm just trying to have you look at a different perspective of the timing or the time in your life. Like they say that timing is everything but then time isn't real or time is relative and you know time is  I don't know if you everyone is being paid by an hour or a salary. But really you're just being paid for your time same with services or being an entrepreneur like all the time that goes into it. And now that I'm transitioning from working in the corporate world or you know, nine-to-five working for a company and transitioning into working for myself from home. That's all going to be my time that I'm being paid for.  And time is all that we have, you know, they say that life is short. But life is the longest thing that you'll ever do. So, it's the little moment. It's the little things that we pay attention to but in this moment right now, I mean the rest of this episode is already long gone behind you can't get it back. You can replay it if you want but those moments whatever you were doing driving spacing out. You're at work. You're on the toilet.  Whatever you're doing. Those are gone. So in this moment you have an accumulated.  Thought process and you have your thoughts you have words you have actions that have led you to this moment. And what are you doing with that these moments are you just writing lists of what you'll do tomorrow or looking back at the time that you didn't have the things that you do now or maybe used to have it all and it's all been wiped from beneath you but  Just find yourself in this moment, and maybe if you have the time to close your eyes, you can really reflect upon. What is it that you say that you're going to do you say that you're going to feel like tomorrow and just do a mental scan. How are you feeling in this moment with the time that you have?  And not letting a nine-to-five completely take over your life. And you know, oh I can't wait for the weekend. I can't wait to be off. I can't wait for this. Like why are we so impatient that were waiting for this destination of Friday or destination weekend or destination clock out of work that were not enjoying the time that we have just being alive.   the time the in-between time, you know everything that we're doing finding joy in it or just being present where we are if you want to go back to school or you want to drop out of school or you want to explore a new career choice or have another baby have a first baby not have babies that all these choices that we're making in the Moment Like if we don't just one two, three, and then  Go we're going to be held back.  And I could do that tomorrow. I can do that another time and if we're just writing lists of things that we intend on doing we might not ever do it. So this is the time is relative.  Because we need to find the absoluteness and just the timing just being now for everything for every thing that comes to our mind for everything that we're taking action on and we're in the right place at the right time and just believing that the people around you are there for a reason whether it's shitty or it's really good and these people are inspiring you.  Just go with your gut go with doing what it is that you want to do and trusting the timing trusting that right now is really all that you have so take that leap and take that step with the blindfold on and not knowing what's going to come beneath your next foot. But just having the faith that  your timing is now to do the things that you say that you're going to do and I know that Mercury retrograde is coming up and I'm going to do a podcast on all of the retrogrades. I'm just getting my ducks in a row before I record it see look at that timing. But but yeah, this was the one that called to me the most right now is talking about time. So the next episode that I'll do will be on that or maybe yeah, but  Either way find it in yourself to take a moment breathe and reflect on this moment and what it is that is in the past or present or future or time maybe in another dimension. Who knows but  To make it about your now in start Crossing off those to do list items. Stop making to-do list.  And just start doing to start living in the moment because you never know when you're going to have a baby for and a half weeks early or you don't know if you know that job is going to need you tomorrow. And even if you don't have that job, I mean, who are you without it? Who are you. And this is where we're really finding ourselves within the time that we have here on this Earth.  With Mercury retrograde coming up though. I would say like hold off on like signing huge documents or maybe traveling unless you've had these plans to travel or just you know, go get your car checked double-check your airline tickets, whatever. But either way just live in the moment. Fuck it Mercury retrograde is just there and just ride the wave of all these eclipses.  Is and retrogrades and everything happening. But this was just my tidbit to you that sometimes time just isn't real and you just go with it your days just go by and maybe they're going by too fast too slow. But to make them really count you have to be in each moment or you're really just counting down until the next weekend the next break that you get.  If you can't find a moment to just breathe in the most chaotic situation, I challenge you to find a way to do that. And that's how what I do in my yoga classes because yoga isn't on the mat. It's off the mat when you get into real life and life gets really scary or hectic. Are you able to just go back to your breath and go back to your body and find a yoga mat like  Energetically to feel like you can take a moment to yourself. So however, you do that meditation yoga prayer hanging out with friends having a drink whatever you need to do to find that moment or even just three quick breaths at work know that time doesn't Define you and you can defined each moment in your life.  by being present  Thank you for listening to this episode. Please leave a rating or leave some feedback.  subscribe  and I appreciate every single one of you for the support and the love and I really hope that you find a moment to take time for yourself. Even if it's just one breath.	Time is all we have.  Time isn t real.  Timing is everything.  Time time time.  But it s all relative.  We all have different views on this term that s going by as I write this.  What are you doing with your time?  Are you waiting for Friday?  Do you know how to capitalize on the moment in the now ?  Let s take a moment to feel the moment & realize it s all we have.  Truly.  Start to redefine & take back your time.

Hey guys, welcome back to another episode of the fashion school dropout today. I'm going over the topic that I probably get asked about the most and that is how to start your styling career. Now, I'm just going to jump right in one of the biggest steps to move in up in your style and career. I'm about to share is really no secret. You heard it many times before but it has to be said again. And again, it's interning now. I know no one wants to hear it, but it's really the best and fastest way to  Move forward in your career and I'm going to explain how and why in just a moment. So when you in turn you get to learn the ins and outs of the game under a more seasoned stylist and this is variance in itself is super valuable. No matter how you go about it. You just can't skip this step. I mean I you can but it'll be extremely hard for you to get anywhere really. So with that said it's a good idea to start building your portfolio by doing test. Shoot that show off your  You're styling skills. And I mean your styling skills. Not only do test shoots. Let you show off your eye for style, but they'll help you be able to book your own jobs down the line. Now, I mentioned your styling skills and I emphasize that because the last thing you want is to intern and assist someone for five years and then you get a spy will job by yourself, but you had no portfolio to show the photographer or the creative director and no matter how many shoots you help God. You can't include another  Styles work in your book or your portfolio, even if you assisted so it's their work, not your so test shoots are definitely the way to go. So if you don't know what test shoots our test shoots are not only for building your portfolio, but there are also amazing for building up your contacts. So basically a test shoot is when a bunch of creative such as the photographer Silas makeup and here are is they get together and they create shoot just for portfolio content now,  These people that you meet on shoes, they can help you build up your portfolio and your network. Now the biggest mistake I see young stylist make is trying too hard to network up instead of networking with people who are on their same level. Now. I always say networking horizontally or laterally is the way to go your creative peers. They'll be the ones to refer you to the job and who knows the photographer that you meet on a test shoot they could be shooting for Vogue.  Harper's Bazaar in five years and if you maintain a good relationship with that person guess who they're going to call it a style that cover. It's probably going to be you now. I know you may be thinking like that's cool and all but I live in a small City. Well, even if you don't live in a big city like LA or New York here is some way to start building your portfolio. So I hope you all are taking notes. So the first one is Instagram, so if you're anything like me  You're on it all day every day. So why not use it to your advantage? So if you see a photographer whose work that you absolutely love go ahead send them a message offering its Alva South earn it shoot it's a win-win situation. So you get new photos for your book. The photographer gets elevated photos featuring amazing clothes that they otherwise they wouldn't know how to where to find or how to put different outfits together. So the way that you can find photographers in your city, no matter  Where you live is simply by searching up the hashtag with your city name and then photographer. So if you live in Atlanta, you've searched up hashtag Atlanta photographer or hashtag ATO photographer and hashtag Atlanta photographers with Sapporo. So you want to use every variation get creative so that goes if you live in Houston or Dallas, you've searched up hashtag Houston photographer hashtag guy was photographers simple as that just to get started.  Edited and a lot of people tend to forget that Instagram. It's a photo search engine. So use it to your full advantage because Lord knows I do. So that's one of the ways that I got my start another way is Craigslist now, I know you might be looking at me crazy right now, but with all things use your discretion with this one, so if something was too good to be true it probably is and I know Craigslist doesn't have the best reputation to say the least.  But they do have great job in Gig opportunities here and there from time to time. So in fact, that's how I got my start, you know, Instagram and Craigslist because I responded to a posting from a photographer who was seeking the stylist for a magazine editorial and that was one of my first published editorials and that magazine they ended up calling me back style more their covers which led to even more opportunities and that was still  In the very beginning of my career, but I already had a couple of photos of my portfolio because I went to Fashion school and I had photos of my own design which leads me to the Nets way to build your book which is our schools. So we're all familiar with Spotify for music right? But did you know that you could also listen to both your favorite artist and podcast just like this one in one place for free and you don't even need a premium account Spotify has a huge  Catalog of podcast on every topic including the one you're listening to right now.

So if you haven't done so already be sure to download the Spotify app search for the fashion school dropout on Spotify or browse podcast in the your library tab. Also, make sure to follow me so you never miss an episode of the fast.  school dropout  art school students photography students as I mentioned networking with those on your same level is crucial because one they're more willing to work with you than someone who's already established and to as both of your careers grow. You can be a source of mutual support So connect with photography students from your local art school or art college who are interested in shooting fashion and use this as an opportunity to build both your portfolio's. I promise there's photography students.  They're who they have no idea how to find a stylist just like you probably have no idea where to find a creative team where to find a photographer's for your ideas. So you guys got to find each other and you know, this is one of the great places to start now last but not least one of the easiest way to build your portfolio and styling is getting some good shots of your friends. So I think we all have that one friend who thinks their model. So go ahead and use that to your advantage so you can  utilize your iPhone or if you have a DSLR that even better go ahead and dress up your Mo's Model S friend and just go for it your first images. No one's expecting them to look like Vogue and the point of it is to just show off your creativity and your styling skills. And this is how I did my very first test shoot. So I remember it was the summer after graduation and I just got some friends from college got a bunch of clothes for my friends.  My sister and I even went thrifting like I head up the Good Will and the Salvation Army for some you know, for some cool stuff. And this is before I knew about showrooms and all that and we just kind of went we went for it. Like it was fun. It was a fun day of shooting like the model got changed in the car wasn't even like a quote-unquote real model is my friend Tina and it's just great to look back on those first shoes and just see how far you've come. So that's the bottom line just  Art, so many of you guys are waiting for that perfect moment that perfect opportunity. Like the perfect moment doesn't exist is what you make of it. So just start from where you are doesn't have to be perfect. Just go for it and you will figure it out. I promise you, you know, we all got to start somewhere and I did too. So if you guys enjoyed today's tips, please go ahead and subscribe and leave a review. I would really appreciate it and be sure to keep an eye out for  Let's episodes.  	As an up and coming stylist, it's important to start building your portfolio by doing test shoots.  Not only do test shoots let you show off your eye for style, but it will help you be able to book your own jobs down the line.  The last thing you want is to intern/assist for 5 years, get asked to style a job by yourself but have no portfolio to show to the photographer/creative director.  No matter how many shoots you've helped on, you absolutely can't include another stylists work in your portfolio, even if you assisted.  It's their work, period.  But have no fear, even if you don't live in a big city like LA or NYC, here are some ways to start building your portfolio.

I want to talk about the gains across the board today. Have you seen I want to talk about one particular? Aucoin xrp this is one of my favorites here. Definitely one of the top five all coins for 2020 as you guys heard on my last episode and here in Bitcoin is.com. They have an article here on three reasons. Why xrp  Maybe Rising today. Number one Finance launches. Xrp Futures Trading the triggering event for the latest price climb seems to have come from finances announcement of an xrp Futures Market this new form of speculative trading would make it possible to bet on price swings without settling for the underlying asset of future Market may also be more liquid and lack of the dangers of Wales dumping on the spot. That's definitely something to look out for I have yet tried.  Futures Trading, but I will check it out and see or what it's about and you know possibly try it out, you know in the near future. Number two New Year's enthusiasm after an underwhelming December xrp slid to as low as 18 cents at that level the community lost some of its hopes but buyers kept stocking up on the asset in case of a rogue rally now, that rally is here the hype May accelerate with higher volatility expectations.  So the seasonal hype after the New Year's plus renewed activity after the end of the holidays boosted xrp trading volumes are expanding slowly to around 1.6 billion per day. This amount is still relatively small in comparison to other leading coins, but low volumes also make it easier for xrp to breed to begin a price hike and number three xrp Rises against Bitcoin. Now that Bitcoin has escaped to some of the most various scenarios for January.  Xrp appears to have gained confidence within minutes that asset started in minor recovery from 2600 so Tashi to above 2700 so touchy with increased BTC stability and the hike for the leading corn above 7500 number three cryptocurrency is also adding to its confidence. So today Bitcoin also Rose as I check not too long ago. It's almost at 8000 like 7800 which  Is a big hike from you know the past few days. It may reach a thousand soon. I think you know, we're headed to a good start early January and you know, we've already seen pretty pretty decent percentage Rises another reason for the spike maybe from insider trading as the rally suspiciously happened just before the official by Nancy announcement was released. There's no evidence to support this claim, but it is highly coincidental that xrp  Price Rose so dramatically ahead of a major announcement. Of course, you know, there's always insider trading and definitely does play a role in them, you know the prices and you know, that's not to say though, you know xrp has been you know doing a lot and and you know, this this I don't know if it's going to be a temporary thing if you guys think it's going to go back down or if it's going to continue on the you know on the rise. I  You know with this launch of financial Futures and I think it's definitely a good thing and definitely good for the future of xrp added to recent positive X RP performance is the statement by Brad Garland house that Ripple cannot control xrp valuations despite the regular s coat retches triple has announced that this not intend to sell off the coins directly quote Ripple can't control the price of xrp any more than whales can control the price of Bitcoin.  He continued yes Ripple owns. A lot of xrp were very interested in the success of xrp but that accusations of us dumping that's not in our best interest in to do that for the asset some of the most extreme predictions allow for displacing Bitcoin. However, for now the coin is fighting to regain positions and confidence xrp has suffered from the general skepticism about all coins. What do you think of the xrp rally? Let me know. Do you guys, you know have faith  and xrp still, you know, when people are you know, losing faith and you know are being coming skeptical because you know, they haven't seen the price go up to a hundred dollars, you know, just I think just some people out there expecting too much or thinking they're going to get rich, you know overnight. I think this is just, you know, one of those things if you're in it for the long term, you have to wait with xrp you have to see how they grow and What markets they reach, you know, how  Can you know convince more financial institutions to use, you know, they're there Ripple Ripple Network, you know, I think we're headed in the right direction. There's definitely, you know more growth and you know, determining what you know how Bitcoin Rises I think will also affect the rest of the old coins and as you'll be seeing Bitcoin has been going up and we're headed in an upward trend.  And you know, there's going to be more mass adoption coming 2020 with all the other old coins and all the other Industries shaking things up. It's becoming you know, very very interesting starting to feel the rumble all around you and you know, I'm just I'm just here to you know, see what who's going to shake things up the most and those are the ones that I'm going to be supporting and going to be within the law.  Run, you know, I don't expect this to you know happen overnight and I really don't think anyone should really expect that either, you know, the ones that are day trading, you know selling and buying on a daily basis are the ones who really want, you know, the price hikes to go up and who are really, you know, either pumping fear and uncertainty into you know, social media. So you just have to do what I do and just, you know, see through all of it.  You know black out all that noise down out there and just focused on facts focused on History focused on Trends focused on information. And you know, I like to go a lot with my gut on something after I've done enough research and you know searched enough information in I really love, you know feel like I've made the right choices and I'll stick with it for a while for the long-term. That is why I'm here.  So let me know what you guys think about these gains. What are you guys interested in? And you know, how how can we go with xrp? You know, I think it's I think it's got ways to go ways to go and that's just one of the good things on another note I do want to talk about is that LR B Ry they released an announcement of you know, kind of an overview of all the changes and improvements that they've made to their platform.  Form and you know, their roadmap is not been released yet, but they said it's going to be released by the end of January. So I'm really looking forward to that and hopefully, you know be out here soon. They have made a lot of updates and great changes to the platform. I really like the platform. I like the UI. I've checked out some other ones. There's another one called seam it, you know, they do things a little bit differently. I'm not too familiar with  It but when I did go over there it you know, it just didn't it didn't appeal to me as much as lbr why kind of feels more like YouTube and you know, they're really working hard on the rewards and you know, we're awarding viewers and content creators on the elbe Ry platform. So, you know, this is one out there. That's really trying to shake things up for, you know content creators and really trying to compete with YouTube. I have already synced.  my two channels over 2L B Ry and looking to see how I can grow and how you know, the platform grows over time as more people, you know are becoming more aware of decentralized platforms 2020 is going to be the year where you know a lot more people are talking about all these new platforms and blockchain and crypto and you know, they're starting to want to you know, ask questions and see what it's all about as long as  Some you know, these platforms and companies can really, you know, simplify the you know, simplify the use of these and understanding because if if you trying to appeal this new platform you blockchain technology to the masses, you can't really explain to them. You know, what's really behind it. What why is it so important you just have to make them understand in a simple way.  For it to really have mass adoption because when you start to get to the you know technical aspects of blockchain Technology, they you know, really start I think start to lose appeal. You have to try to make it as simple as possible, you know, not everyone is like, you know, not everyone's a tacky but you know, I guess show people that you know, they are valued as a viewer as you know, wearing your parents, you know YouTube you're just, you know browsing and  Not getting rewarded for anything or really feel like you're participating much into that effort for you know, a lot of content creators who are bringing, you know, valuable information and you know at entertaining content out there for all of us to enjoy on a daily basis. I'll be I was just a quick, you know, I'll be Ry update.

Autoplay free text files show thumbnail while playing audio files Channel thumbnails next to comments, you know, a lot of bug fixes. They've been doing they've improved the searching on the elbe Ry platform you can you know, click on the hashtags as if you noticed and I'll bring you, you know to an overview of videos containing those hashtags, you know, a lot of performance side issue.  With the wallet servers a lot of Navigation updates. They're coming up with referral changes. It says here were in the middle of revamping our referral program to make it easier for users to share referrals and claim refers today. This is a this is accomplished via a long and ugly URL that takes users to lbr why.com. And we need to do some magic in the background to link up the referral and the invited users via IP.

She's in the California area and she'll be sharing her story. I myself have also done travel therapy. I don't know if you've listened to any previous episodes, but I did travel therapy for about a year and a half and after talking to this woman it gave me the serious travel bug. I just really enjoy.  Made my experience doing travel therapy. But just to kind of give you two different point of views. I'll talk about what I liked about it when I didn't like about it and then you'll be able to hear her whole interview in a minute. So what I liked about it is obviously the traveling piece. I love our country and I wanted to see as much as I could. I remember when I was in college. I used to call my parents and I'd be like, okay, I'm moving to Montana and then I would do like serious research and look up apartment.  And look up jobs and even apply to different jobs and then you know, maybe a month later. I feel like okay, I'm gonna move to California and then same thing I would end up researching and I just always was drawn to different areas of the country. So I did that repeatedly and then finally occurred to me that maybe I'm not someone who was ready to settle down right away. So traveling would be like a good opportunity to try out different areas of the country.  Tree and then you know decide where I wanted to settle down the road. So I started off playing it safe. I got a travel position in the state that I graduated in. So I was in Maryland and I started off working there and that was some really nice transition because I was able to stay in my apartment. I felt like I was in a community. I was already comfortable with and it wasn't too shocking that way. So I just got to do the work in peace. It was my first job.  I did have a mentor and I felt pretty supported. So it was a really nice easy transition into the Working World. I will say that in hindsight. I recognize that a lot of what I was asked to do was not the most ethical and I think that that's why I would say if you're a new grad, I would wait at least a year. Yeah. I honestly I would wait at least a year so that you can see  what a normal average ethical position looks like and you can kind of build your own radar engage for what's appropriate and what's not appropriate because I did kind of feel pressure to pick up patients. That weren't necessarily appropriate. I I can't even imagine what our productivity was I would say. It was well over a hundred percent just to to share with you since this podcast. I try and be as transparent as possible.  I was given a handout from the CEO of the company. The CEO is very involved and it was a smaller company so he gave me a handout and it showed what you Bill for independent and what you Bill for concurrent and the way it was phrased was if it's a concurrent treatment than its two people doing the same exact exercises at the same exact time if it's independent then or individual sorry if it's in  Dividual then it's two or more people who are doing different personalized activities that the therapist running but it can be at the same time. Now that is not true. Now that I'm more of a seasoned veteran out in the field. I fully understand that that's not true is very unethical but you know back when I was 22, I really had no idea. There was only one other OTR and he assured me we graduated.  Same school, he assured me that it was ethical and I didn't do enough research and I just kind of followed blindly and went along with it. And that's why I would say it's better to have some experience or at least be in contact with somebody who's been out in the field so you can bounce questions off of them and say hey is this normal is this? Okay my doing the right thing because I will say even at the time I did feel a little bit weird about it.  But I kind of gave in to that pressure. So that's just my two cents on that. So from there, I bounced around the country. I worked in four different states. I was licensed in five and it was great to see our country. Most of the positions were in skilled nursing facilities. Most of them lasted about 13 weeks. Some of them were shorter. One of them. I was asked to extend so I extended longer and overall it.  Really nice experience, but there were different placements where maybe I didn't necessarily feel totally included. For example, you know the whole building might be attending a meeting and then I would show up to the meeting and they say, oh no, this is for our employees and then you know, that's fine. I don't really like to sit in meetings anyway, but it was just kind of the phrasing of like us versus them a little bit. I didn't run into that too much though. So for the most part,  Part, I did feel very included wherever I went and let's see for the pay the pay was awesome. I was making I think on average let's say like 1500 take home and that included my per diem stipend and with that stipend I would pay for my own housing from that and I would buy my own food and of course all those types of things, so it was a tax-free stipend. Let's say approximately $1000.  And then my technical rate was about fourteen dollars an hour at my placement at the time. I didn't do a great job of negotiating. I tend to be kind of a I don't know the right word. I guess like a little bit more Meek and something that I'm working on but I think I could have negotiated that price a little bit higher had I had the confidence that I have now, but again, I was a new God. So I just kind of went with the flow. They told me the rate I  for maybe like ten dollars more and then they pumped me up for the $10 per week which and it's really not much at all. Okay other things the placements themselves. I feel like you had to really choose either location or setting so I chose mine based more on location, which meant most of my settings were in skilled nursing facilities, and I think  If I were to try it now that I have kind of more varied experience that might open up more doors, but as a new grad, I basically only have the experience of whatever travel position I started in. So I started in a Skilled Nursing Facility. My next one was in a Skilled Nursing Facility. My next one was in like a adult day rehab more for like special needs adults. And then my third one was a Skilled Nursing Facility / outpatient, but it was kind of an outpatient.  Aunt kind of a LF but it was phrased as an outpatient type of thing. So yeah, I think I only did for when I found my recruiter it really just kind of came to dumb luck. I talked to so many different recruiters and was actually kind of overwhelming because now even still I get so many phone calls a month by the recruiters and it just so happened that I'd finally made the decision that I was going to do travel therapy.  And that Dale I think within the hour after talking to my family about it and really considering this option. I got a call from a recruiter. So she sort of got my business. She was sweet and she was kind and she called it the perfect time. So that's how I chose my recruiter. I did stay loyal to her for two and then I think I switched to somebody else because she had left so I switched to a different company.  Because I wanted to see what else was out there and my recruiter was no longer available. Okay, so that's my experience as far as travel therapy. I think that just about sums it up. So let's get our friend on the line and she will share about her experience in the school system as a contractor. Alright? Hi Devon. Thank you so much for joining me. All right. Thank you for having me. So I'm hoping you can be our expert on travel therapy.  Awesome. Can you please share before we get started? Like what year you graduated and what type of program you were in? Yeah, so I graduated in 2015 with my Master's Degree. I was actually lucky to be able to do a combined bachelor's and master's degree program. So whenever I started college as an undergrad, I knew I wanted to be an OT so all in all the program took me about five and a half years to complete with Summers, but  after that, you know had the bachelors in the Masters who was ready to be an OT. Oh, that's awesome. I actually did the same thing. So before you became a travel therapist What fields did you initially start off in so I mostly did Pediatrics, but honestly my first day of work as an official OT was in home health my pediatric company. That was my first job had picked up an adult Home Health contract. I needed coverage for it. So I had the availability in my  Since I just started there, so that was actually my first day of work which is funny since I didn't intend it to go into Pediatrics. But you know, a lot of my fieldwork experience was with adults. I kept up a pure and job in the sniff, you know my first year out of school and then once I did get into the Pediatrics, I did outpatient pediatrics with a little bit of early intervention a little bit of seeing kids in their homes and also at daycares and that kind of stuff and then  One of the daycares I went to was also kind of a preschool. So a little bit of school-based but didn't get too into school-based until I started becoming a being a travel therapist. Okay, so can you speak about why you started to become a travel therapist and kind of what drove that decision for you. So it was a combination of a lot of things travel has always been super important to me always been something. I've tried to prioritize just in my personal life and I realized like two years.  To full-time employment. Like I had not taken any major trip basically since I graduated and so, you know, I realized that I wasn't really putting my money where my mouth was in regards to like saying trouble with the priority for me and part of the reason for that was because my job like as much as I loved it did not pay super. Well the area where I went to school. It's pretty saturated without tease, you know the school I went to release his to graduating classes a year of about  Coyotes and all of those people, you know myself included initially want to stay in that general area work after they're done with school. So while I never had trouble finding a job, I definitely have trouble finding a job that paid anywhere near anything. You know, what I was told I would be making when I was in grad school. So it was kind of just a combination of both those things. I thought about doing travel for a while and it just like never really pulled the trigger on it. You know, I had a lot of ties back home that I wanted to keep up with and then  You know, I don't know something just changed where I was like no, I think I think we're gonna do this now. So I was able to get my boyfriend. I'm bored. He had a work from home job at the time which made an easier transition. And so we were like, let's just let's do it. Like let's go do the travel thing. Oh, that's awesome. So he was able to travel with you. Yeah. Yeah. So we've been traveling together for just a little bit over a year ago. So how long have you been an OT before you started traveling just a  little bit over two years and how in the world did you go about picking a company and a recruiter I signed up for I did travel therapy for a couple contracts and I still get bombarded with phone calls. I mean probably every Monday I think is when they make their phone calls and I'll get at least one phone call a week. Yeah. I've got a similar experience as I think anyone who's like put a resume online as you know, when I first got out of school, I signed up with a lot of agencies like  With the hopes of just finding a local contract and of course there never were any local contracts in the area where I live because it was so easy to find out he's you know, you didn't need to go through an agency. I still got calls and emails and all that kind of stuff from people as much as I told them like no, you know, I'm not interested right now, but then when I did decide to travel, you know, I did it with some intention and so I contacted my friends that I had known to do travel therapy and got some referrals.  From them for their recruiters, but you know, honestly the first contract I took ended up just being one of those random email list someone from Delta like sent me just a mass email that talked about a pediatric position and Lala. I knew I wanted to make it out to the West Coast whether that was California or Washington or Oregon. So yeah, I just did a cold email back and I was like Hey, like is this La position still available? And it was it but there was a bunch of other positions available and I ended up really  Like that recruiter so it ended up working out just kind of chance. Oh, that's exciting. Did ya a loyal to that company or have you kind of bounced around between different recruiting companies so far? I've only been with them, but I'm not opposed to working with a different company, you know something that I always advise people when they are starting travel therapy is to work with a different couple different recruiters a couple different companies just because it helps you keep your options open, you know, no company is going to have all the  jobs all the time and it can also help people who are not as experienced with travel therapy and make sure that what they're getting paid and their benefits and all that kind of stuff is a fair deal that makes a lot of sense. Yeah. So I've been happy with Delta, you know, they've been great to me so far but, you know, nothing against them personally, but I definitely would not be opposed to working with someone else if they had the right job for me. How do you go about even like getting a placement? Like what's that process look like so you start out by  You know getting in touch with a recruiter at one of these companies, whether that's you know from a personal recommendation or one of those email list or there are a couple recruiter matching Services now available to Travelers, which I'm super excited about but you know, you start out with a recruiter and then you'll have to fill out some information with them send them your resume send them like a skills checklist, which is kind of goes over. You know, what you've already done is an OT what you areas you feel comfortable in and that kind of stuff and then they will just start sending.  Jobs your way. So with my recruiter it was about a month. I think in total of a process before, you know, I started contacting her and then had a job and had a contract. Yeah, they meet your requirements. Like if they're the locations in the settings you want they'll send them to you and then if you like them you say yes, go ahead and submit me and all that means is they'll send your resume or other paperwork over to the actual hiring facility. And then as long as the hiring facility likes it you have a phone interview scheduled mutually a week.  Maybe even less and then if that goes well and you like the job that's it how much downtime between assignments do you typically have so I had no downtime between my first and second assignment and I've only done School District assignment so far. So I've actually taken longer contracts that kind of what typical for the industry if you're not working in the school system. So my first contract was from January to June and I think the last day of school was  Like June 15th or something like that, and then my next contract was also a school system, but I actually ended up working summer school for them and their summer school started on June 17th. So it was literally a turnaround of a weekend. You know, I have my last day Friday at the others School District when I started at the new school district on Monday, so very short turnaround, you know, and from what I've seen like from talking to other people and friends who do travel sometimes it's like that sometimes it's like a pack your bags you're going and then sometimes  You know, you will have to wait longer between contracts if you're if you're trying to look for a specific setting or location, especially so does this company primarily do school contracts or did they just place you with that because of your experience that was kind of the field that I was interested in going to they do all sorts of contracts. No school based in medical and whatever else but I knew I wanted to try to stick the Pediatrics. I was open to adults and I've worked with adults in the past but  But Pediatrics is definitely like where my love lies. So, you know, I wanted to either do schools or outpatient early intervention or something and I was kind of interested in schools the most just because it was the setting that I had the least experienced in and another reason I did travel was the targeting experience in different settings and just become a more well-rounded therapist. What about getting different licenses does the company help you with getting a different license or paying for that at all? Yes, so pretty much every  Company that's like large enough has a credentialing department and they will actually they'll help you with your license all the way up to actually filling out paperwork for you and dealing with the state boards and that kind of stuff which was really helpful. So when I first started looking I was working with one company and they helped me apply for my California and Washington licenses at the same time just because those as far as OT license is go can be a little bit longer to obtain compared to some other states.  Dates and trouble world moves fast. So you kind of want to have those licenses ready if an assignment does come up that you want to take so we went ahead and applied for those and got those knocked out. That way I could take any assignment that came up. Yeah, because I know it's very steep to stayed on how quickly the license can go through but your recommendation is to just kind of get whatever state you might be interested in ahead of time sort of guy would try to keep it limited, you know, if there's definitely a  Place where you want to go and you're like dead set on it like yes get that license for sure. Like especially if it is one like California or Washington that takes longer to get approved. But you also don't want to get too many licenses because then you start running into the difficulties of just all the bureaucratic nonsense that goes with having all these licenses in different states. So it hasn't been too much of a headache for me yet because I only have my Kentucky and my California and my Washington license but most of these states when  You apply to get a new license will want verifications from all of the other states where you also hold an OT license, which isn't a big deal when you first start applying but then you know, if you do this for a while you start to get a big pile of licenses and then you have to wait on all those licenses to talk to those other states for your getting a new license to verify that you have a license they're in good standing and that kind of stuff. So definitely don't go crazy with getting licenses would be my advice. But if you have a couple states that you want to try to get to  Start with those and then go from there. That's really good advice. I think I've had like five state licenses and because they were all within like five years. I still have to contact each of them. Like say I wanted to get licensed in Kentucky. I would have to contact all five of those States and have it sent over which like not only takes time but it's really expensive like sometimes 30 or 50 dollars per state and you know some  Require background checks, it can get really exhausting. Yeah, exactly and to the other reason I wouldn't advise just kind of going blind getting licenses is because there are a lot of states or areas where there's just not as much need Grote. So you kind of want to focus on the states that like you are likely to find a job and you're likely to find something that you like just because you know, it is a lot of money and it adds up and if you don't ever get to use that license your kind of just out of luck, so  At your current job or at all your placements. Do you feel like you get to be part of the team or do you kind of feel like you're more transient member? I definitely feel like I get to be part of the team, but I'm also Lucky in that way because I have taken contracts that are kind of longer, you know, typically if you're doing like a more medical contractor a contract at a snap you're probably going to be there for about three months in total. Whereas, you know, the first district I was at I just work the second semester.  Sir, but I was still there for six months and this District. I'm working at now. You know, I did this summer school and I'll be there until the end of the school year. So I've definitely had more time to like, you know, get to know people and feel like part of the team, but I think I think there are ways to you know, kind of get to know everyone and be part of the team even if you are somewhere for a short time. Do you have to wear like a special badge or anything that shows that you're kind of a separate entity than the  Itself so far. No so far. Both of the district's they've just given me their standard badge. Yeah. It's been pretty easy so far good and what about like filling out your time log, do you send that to the school or do you send that to your contract company? So it goes to both there's a website. So I just filled out electronically at the end of each week and then it first goes to the school system for them to review and approve and then once they approve them  a hours, then it gets into the contract company and they handle their into things what would happen if say you got to a placement and the caseload was ridiculous and you just felt like ethically this was not an appropriate fit. Would you be able to contact your your company and have them kind of negotiate or talk about it or would you kind of be responsible for talking to that school that actually did happen this contract, you know at my last District. I was lucky because  Everyone was super kind and supportive and so I was new to school based practice but not pediatric practice, but they really helped me like learn all the ins and outs of the school system and IEPs and all that fun legislation. So by the time I left there, I had a pretty good handle I thought and then I got to this district and my caseload was almost double what it was in the last district and I was like, oh no and you know, I'm pretty active online and like with mentor  being and that kind of stuff and so, you know, I always advocate for like if your disks or if your caseload is unmanageable like reach out like do something like don't feel like that you are compelled to treat all these kids like if you can't do it and so it was it was a little bit of a learning experience for me because I was like, oh, well, I guess I actually have to do that now and advocate for myself because this is this is just kind of a crazy amount of kids. And so I ended up doing both and both reaching.  Up to my supervisor at the school district, but also reaching out to my recruiter and you know my supervisor at the school district ended up being really receptive and open to feedback. It was her first year in that position. She had previously been working them like as a special ed teacher. I'm not an administrator and so she was really open and you know, she just agreed with me a lot about a lot about about a lot of it which was really validated.  And nice because I was like, I don't know if this is what they just think is typical here. Like I don't know. This is just how they expect people to be. You know, it wasn't like they were giving me a huge workload because I was a traveler, you know, all of the other rotis in the district had similar case loads and just seemed kind of okay with it knows like I don't know if I'm just like not aware of like what an appropriate case load is but this feels like too much and you know, she agreed with me and we worked out a plan to get it down to a reasonable.  More milk, we keep going approximately what that caseload was. I know that we have quite a few School therapist who listen to this and I'm we're probably in the same group, but I was in a group where people describe their caseloads and it is so varied across the United States. It's blowing my mind. Yeah, so my caseload and I never got a exact number on it because one of the frustrating things that happened was at the start of the school year. They had switched over to a new documentation.  System and so I had been given my caseload at the start of the school year, which was about 50 55 kids. I think starting out which is like kind of a lot but also like in the Realms of manageable potentially just depending on how many you know, how many minutes the kids are seeing how often they're seeing how much is console that kind of stuff but it was still like kind of a high number to start with especially when the last District I work for my caseload topped out at 37 and so but then what  Was when they switched over to this new system, like all of the kids didn't get transferred over so wouldn't happen every week. I'd like to the point of almost happening every day. Honestly the first month or two of the school year, but I would find out about a new kid that was supposed to be seen by me but was not on my caseload that I had never heard of that the case manager hadn't contacted me about until they needed something and then I was like, oh, well, here's another kid that I'm going to fit into the schedule that's already really full. So it would just keep happening and I was that  was one of the things that was like my breaking point to where I was like, oh I need I need help. I need to have the cape for myself because I can't keep having this happen to where you know my case load gets totally insane. And then I have another kid how to do it the next day. So I think all in all I think it topped out at like 67 before I was like, okay, we gotta we gotta figure this out. But you know a lot of it a lot of it was kids that like didn't actually need  Repeat any more kids that were like, you know coming up to be discharged or maybe needed a little bit less therapy. So it was a process but I was eventually able to discharge kids that really didn't need to be on caseload anymore move. A lot of kids to consult that really didn't need direct therapy anymore. So all in all I think now, you know the middle of the school year. My caseload is 55 again, but it's a lot more manageable and I think 10 to 15 of that is just  Sold for the I see once a month or email with their teacher. I think that's admirable that you stuck it out. I think kind of an easy route would have been to say hey, I'm a contractor. I don't need to really deal with this and then kind of exit from there. So I think it's cool that you were you know able to step up and be the one to advocate for not just you but sounds like other therapists in the area. No, it was definitely a good experience and a good conversation that I think everyone had wanted.  However, had tried to have and was just never very successful for one reason or another so it actually helped us start, you know, looking at things like work load versus case load models looking at how we determine the needs for services and who stays on therapy and just like kind of, you know setting the expectations for like these are the kinds of kids that we see in the school system. This is the kind of stuff that we work on. Yeah. It just started a lot of really good conversations. I think everyone had been wanting to have  So are you paid hourly or do they pay you kind of like a salary? I'm paid hourly. I have guaranteed hours at this placement. It's 37 and a half and that the last placement was 40, but yeah just hourly is how I'm actually paid and when you do your contract do you get to negotiate that at all or is it kind of like set in stone? This is what we're going to pay you for the year.  There's definitely some room for negotiation. But what I found is that there is no free money and travel. So even if you think you're negotiating sometimes about some things it might just be like the Contracting agency moving money around to make you happy if that makes sense generally, like when a facility hires a contract therapist Bill post the position and they'll post this number that called the bill rate and so the bill rate is  The rate that the contract agency will actually build a facility per hour of your time. So say for this job just to use an even number. Let's say my bill rate is 50 dollars an hour. Well from that fifty dollars an hour that I work at some of that goes to the agency some of that goes to their overhead for finding the position and the support from the recruiter then some of it goes to my hourly rate and then some of it goes to my stipends rate, which is another Tax Free Housing and the tax free meals  And then you know, there's just so many other things that that bill rate can go into and so once a facility sets that bill right like it's kind of set, you know what this point they're using a Contracting agency. They're already probably like in desperate need of a therapist like they are probably offering like, you know, the highest that they can offer like very close to the highest they can offer so I wouldn't say that you can't negotiate but I would say just  Just remember that it might just be someone moving money around to make you happier if that makes sense. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. I know when I did travel contracts they would offer the money kind of presented in different ways. Like will pay for your phone bill. But if they paid for the phone bill, then they're not going to do you know any tuition reimbursement. It's like they just present it in different ways. But at the end of the day you're getting the same pool of money exactly.  So you don't have to answer this but on my podcast, I like to kind of talk about what a lot of people don't talk about which is salary. Could you share ballpark of what a salary you would accept as a contracted School therapist in your area. Yeah, so I can just be straight with you at my first contract which was in Northern California and a really rural town. I made about 1600 a week after tax.  Which I know is hard to compare to like perm job numbers. If you're used to hearing about like, you know, I make 60,000 a year or something like that. But basically at that first job, you know with both of my hourly rate and the rate that I was given in tax-free stipends. I cleared 1600 a week now at this contract. I'm living in a more suburban area and an area that's like under a huge housing crisis. So I was originally offered  About the same rate. I think it was a little bit closer to the 1700 a week, but still like 1650 maybe and then I looked at housing prices around here and I was like, oh, I don't think I can do that. Like, you know, I was able to make that work before because I was living in such a rural town that even though it was California like, you know, things were pretty cheap comparatively but here we're just a little bit south of the bay area, which is like one of the most expensive places in the entire country and there's a huge housing crisis.  is here and like in all of the surrounding areas, so not only were the apartments expensive they were hard to find and you know, sometimes like they would just disappear and so I had had a lot of hesitancy accepting the second contract but you know, I took it back to my recruiter and I was like Hey, like I don't think I can make this number work like if I have to pay for housing and then they're like, well, you know, what if we do the housing and so  Company housing is something that like Som therapists and other Travelers. I know like we'll never get and they're like, oh don't ever take company housing. It's a bad deal. It's such a ripoff like they're taking your money and for me it ended up actually saving any money so they ended up putting me up in apartment because we're going to be here for the entire school year and the apartment itself costs like $3,600 a month, which is like, oh just like disgusting to me like it makes me feel  Feel like so uncomfortable to even you know, even though I'm not the one setting the checks I am paying thirty six hundred dollars in housing costs the month, but the apartment itself cost that much and then they also rented furniture for it. They also pay for a cable package and sent me an Amazon fire stick and they also put us up in a pretty nice hotel the first week. We were here while the apartment was still getting ready and with all of that together it  Is way more than what they were able to offer me and housing stipends. So I'm not exactly sure what kind of magic they polled, you know, sometimes companies like that have agreements with like apartment rental places where they're able to get things for a cheaper price or get reimbursements later. So it's possible that that's what they were able to do, but I know that if I had been the one to rent this place personally, I would be paying like $4,000 a month and housing costs, and I'm not so I was happy with  Any housing this time around even though it's not always the right choice. Yeah, that sounds it. That's crazy. I didn't realize it was that expensive. I knew it was like the most or one of the most expensive in this country. Can you share any advice to a therapist who might be considering to do travel therapy? Um, I would have so much advice but I don't want to be overwhelming definitely try to find a mentor if you can you know, whether it's someone that has done trouble.  If you before even if it's not an Eau T necessarily could be a PT or speech therapist Ruben. I'm nurse just someone who has like familiarity with the process and then for whatever setting you're working in especially if you're a new grad, like try to find like a clinical Mentor that you can work with to and just go to with any questions, you know, it's just with travel like honestly a lot of the time you're going to be alone or maybe being a place where it's not always easy to find mentorship on the  Job, so just making sure that you have someone that you can go to if you do have any trouble is definitely important. I know that when I first started working in schools, even having two years of pediatric experience under my belt schools are just different enough that I was calling my best friend who works in school based practice like almost every day for the first couple weeks. They're just asking questions and trying to learn everything I could about that sitting do you feel like companies offer mentors if you ask for them, or is it kind of you'd have to  And somebody like a friend I want some companies do and I've never tried it personally, but what I have heard from other people is that even if they do like assign you a mentor it's often not always easy to either get a hold of them or like, you know find times where you guys can both make it work and talk because you know that Mentor is another trouble therapist who could be three time zones away from you and super busy as well. So I've definitely heard of companies offering mentorship, but so far I haven't  Haven't heard too many success stories yet with it, but they could be out there. Okay, that's good to know though. So you just kind of have to put it on yourself to try and find somebody who's maybe walked this road or a similar road before you yeah, exactly and you know, not every placement is going to like expect you to be a fully competent therapist treating everyone on day one with no questions. So don't feel like you can't reach out and ask questions of the people around you, you know at my first contract even though  Was the only OT there were other speech therapist. There was the director of special ed. There were people that I could reach out to you about the process. Even if it wasn't necessarily OT specific. Oh, I had a question that just came to my mind. I know you have your 37 and a half hours. Does that include like paperwork time? Like if you knew that you had maybe like three three years within the month would they be able to  Extend and give you more money if you knew that you were going to be doing work at home. Yes, and honestly, like I never take work home. I never work outside of contracted hours. I really make a point to advocate for that advocate for other people doing that, you know, too often I hear stories from people talking about how they did a travel contract and they just took all their documentation home with them and they were working like 60 hour weeks, but only getting paid for 40 and I'm just like no  Don't know like please say no, please stand up for yourself an advocate, you know, you should be able to get both your patient care done and your documentation done in those hours. And if you're not then there's a problem. So definitely don't feel like you have to bear that burden. I definitely have all the time now to be able to do my paperwork within those a lot of hours, you know, if there ever is a week where it's really crazy like I could bill up to 40 hours and I don't think they would blink an eye.  But if it ever did come awake there I was needing consistent over time then I think that's another point where I would go and be like, okay like this case loads getting a little crazy again. Like let's see what we can do about it. Are there any questions that you wish I had asked you or anything else that you'd like to share with people. I think that's the big part. Yeah, definitely just reach out for mentorship. There's a lot of good Facebook groups with travel therapist or even just like School based therapy in general or snack or whatever setting you're working in.  I participate in those all the time both the ask questions and help out other people doing all the research you can before you start it and during the process of traveling that way like if anything ever does happen, you're not surprised by it. You kind of prepared to roll with the punches and this is just a question. I like to ask everybody if you were 18 again and knowing what you know now would you go into occupational therapy? Yeah. I think I would it.  It's it's funny that you ask that because since I did do that combined program, you know, I decided to be an OT when I was 17, which is coming up on ten years this spring when I decided to apply into that program and so it's just kind of funny, you know, even though I've only been practicing for going on for like just knowing that I was going to be an OT for 10 and you know, I still feel the same as I did 10 years ago. I'm super happy with the profession. Yeah with all the challenges that  Along with it. I don't think I would have done anything differently. That's awesome. That's really exciting to hear. Yeah. Well, thank you so much for coming on here. Well, thank you for doing this. This is a good project by. Alright guys, so a huge.

spotify:episode:440msAaxDlLdL5HUDwoiSJ	Hello. Hello hello and welcome to v. No nothing the podcast where I probably know just as much as you but with a glass of wine in my hand. I know even less.  Maybe way less. I am Lucy from Lucy on the ground the mean / pop culture Instagram account that talks about everything from what the hell Kanye is doing with this church to why Meg Ryan is a rom-com goddess. Yeah, we're gonna get into that tonight with me against his will once again is the one and only Bill welcome Bill hello to your living room. Thank you for last week. You actually promoted me.  Your Facebook and also begged anyone to replace you as the guests. I'm also your booking agent now to yeah, it's a few just taking all the I didn't hire you for that. Yeah, how's it going? I had a couple of responses. You might have some quality acts lined up coming up. I feel like I saw some of those responses and some of those are not didn't say they were all quality. I just had a couple quotes. Okay. Well, we'll see you guys but a lot of you have spoken out and he refuses to accept this but  You are in demand with this podcast people enjoy it. That being said you did this weekend on Thursday drop like, oh, I'm famous. Casually. No. No, I just need you to know that I'm gonna have some Flex sometimes uh-huh. Uh-huh. Well, usually we start this off with us realizing how much we drink this weekend. We're usually suddenly like no we only drink  One day at four days and suddenly we're really concerned about ourselves. But this weekend didn't drink we did good. We just didn't want to we drank Thursday and that's when Bill we went to a drag bar and watch RuPaul's Drag Race and it was awesome a drag. It was at Sidetrack in Chicago. It was so I've never been before unreal the crowd was so into it and then they did a drag show in between everything.  Nothing, the hosts were amazing. But when I said to Bill I was like are you sure you want to go with it? Go to this he goes. Well, I'm famous. Like of course I can go. So that's what he dropped it. That's what I'm referencing. Also. I had been to that bar. And I know it was a pretty fun time. Anyway, it's seven rooms. Its mass its you get lost. It was a it was packed though everywhere. It's not just like one room had this big TV and that's what know everywhere. It was amazing. I enjoyed it. But I also feel great because we drank Thursday we drink a bit.  But then we no shots. No, but and we were out still late. Yeah, and then drank didn't drink Friday or Saturday and then we have dabbled in a glass of wine tonight. What are we drinking tonight bill or a bottle tonight? We polished off a bottle of Kings clay Cabernet Sauvignon 2017, but I got last week some of you might have seen on my story.  My subscription again that I'm always meeting to cancel first Leaf I've had for years it comes every like three months just because it was coming once a month and that was excessive for me. So I changed it to three months. So I always forget then 2 cancels. It's so absurd subscription and it came last week and that was where the bottle was from and it was pretty good. Yeah. I mean the first sip we were kind of like most worried about it tasted very peppery kind of had interesting.  Fruit notes to it. But by the end of the second glass I was like, yeah, I mean I could keep drinking if I wanted to right now. I feel like you're I can't even quote Parent Trap to you because she's always like well because they're terrible parents. No, we watch that. No smell terrible. I didn't mean to segment into this they are not terrible.  Shadowing so it's episode. So when we do drink the wine those specially when it comes in this box, what we like to do is take a sip and guess how much that bottle of wine cost and tonight the Kings clay I had guessed was about a $10 bottle you had guy said 15 and you can find it at a discount wine store for about 17 or regular retailer 422. So this one incident, yeah, the the wine box worked out that means the other five bottles. We got probably are worth five dollars a clip but Kings clay wasn't bad.  Well, of course, that's the one we picked to start off with and the first step. We were like, yeah, and then once you Google that we're both like well, that's what finish my second glass and I've been contemplating. Oh that was your third glass because I did I barely got a second glass. So once again on the second class the same no, I already had some of my glass what I had when I polish off the rest of the bottle. No, once again, you did that you'd always have more than the same time this time this time at least  I'm not wrong. You just you're tricking me. All right. So like I said tonight we did drink last episode. We were just like no we're having water we were done. So couple glasses. We're feeling good. We'll see how much we slur right and Bill honestly needed a few glasses because this is going to be an episode for him. This is not the beginning he'll be into but his Nemesis comes  Zup, Kardashian. Hmm But first  A big deep sigh is our first topic is actually really serious you guys and I want to take a moment to address this because I hope that I can be the change that you all need and the inspiration you all need and you know, maybe there wasn't though weren't those people in your life who are showing you the right way and that's become more clear to me this week. And so with that we're going to get into  That March Madness rom-coms because what the actual fuck I'm sorry. I was going to dial it back and kind of intro in and be a little nicer to you all but no, I'm actually pissed we had sweet 16 this week. We were supposed to have Ali date, but I was so shocked by the sweet 16 results from all of you that I had to push Elite eight back till this coming week. I mean  I don't I don't know what happened.  We lost.  All of the classics and a lot of you I've spoken to some of you and it was a little bit of well, it's not technically a rom-com or it's not all happy and I just know it's no it's not I don't need Insight from you because a lot of people are also throwing shade at you. I haven't brought this up to you, but people believe that Sleepless You've got mail or because of you no, no, no stop. I will just say  No, no, no, no, no, no, no. No the hooker made the elite eight. I need you. Also stop call like Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman the hooker because she is more than that, and it's rude.  First of all, I'm gonna start till yeah. So Meg Ryan didn't make the elite eight and how many movies three movies Crash and Burn that's so not true and like as someone who hates Teddy Mellencamp who will be her stepdaughter at some point soon. Like you would think I'd turn on Meg. I will never turn on Meg because Meg Ryan is rom-coms Right rom coms are my grind and Tom Hanks, but specifically Meg Ryan. No, I need you to stop. This is about me now and  Your Insight is so unnecessary and not even intuitive because let's talk real quick. What movie did you tell me? You hadn't seen today? Oh My Best Friend's Wedding, which also lost has not seen it you guys I need to it's not even what sweets not even an Elite 8 movie. Why would I say it's garbage? Let me tell you something you guys this March Madness to me now not real like Bible e whatever movie with the only way this becomes okay pretty woman with  winds may be Love Actually, but what else we've got left.  If you all let one of these other ones win, I generally agree with the elite eight.  Like stop your dad just doing this to poke the bear. You could look at my bracket. I think I'm pretty accurate with the elite eight is go you because there's no overrated my grind it. Oh my God, you guys first of all, that's not true. Because you know, and you have said  When Harry Met Sally that was the one seed overall that was the number one overall one seed yeah and it is because rom coms are based off that movie. I'm sorry. No. Yeah, but I think I like that movie because when we went to go see it in the theater, they let us bring a pizza in with us. And so I was influenced by the cheese. Okay. I think you're just now trying to stir stir shit up. I can tell by your smart. Yeah, so let me just say When Harry Met Sally.  It's a goddamn classic like Billy Crystal Meg Ryan. Their whole story is the Journey of a romance. That wasn't meant to be a romance. They were friends first. They hated each other first. I'm sorry, then they became friends. It's a full Arc. A lot of the final movies are not a full Arc and not deep enough as deep as When Harry Met Sally. Also a lot of you were like my best friend's wedding. It's really not a rom-com. Yeah it is.  Sorry that Julia Roberts is the one to win the man in the end because Cameron Diaz was a nicer person. And remember we're only fell for Cameron. He belonged with Cameron, but you know we did get  A sing-along which I told you last week and I'm not going to hit the note this week just because I'm so emotional but I'm gonna go for it forever and ever you'll stay in my heart. I actually might have killed it. I'm not sure stop shaking your head. It wasn't as good as last week's but I might go into her that being said, like I said, oh my God and you've got mail bouquets of sharpened pencils. Look do Tom and Meg probably need therapy after you've got mail because he obviously lied to her and there was  I'm like background there with NY 1 5 2 and shopgirl and AOL and the whole thing. They met in a chat room. Like it was probably before chat rooms were super sexual and then that caviar is a garnish Happy Thanksgiving Happy Thanksgiving back. There are so many moments in that because also Nora Ephron you don't know who Nora Ephron is.  I'm just done. They're just done with this whole thing and it makes me very upset. So obviously I had to put a pause on it. So what were going into this week is just our real caliber of nonsense. We have she's all that that's probably the most iconic like mm shit on she's all that two days ago, and I said I was in high school and it was out. I saw it like a million times. I don't ever have to see it again. She's all that she literally took her glasses off and they cut her.  And that was her makeover like it is that's that that's that's the plot hole in all of these epic rom-coms. Absolutely one that Princess Diaries. She had like some shitty hair. No. Yeah. I stand on that pothole Freddie Prinze jr. Like she was already hot. She just wore overalls and he's like, let's put her in a sexy little dress. I don't sense that. That is that that is in the elite eight. Yes, you have to agree that that's nonsense that beat out Crazy Stupid Love by 15 points. When was She's All That?  I'm out in the early 2000s know 90s. Was it 90s? Yeah, I would say that it was a top of its time. So, why would it not be elite eight? If it's one of the best all the other movies that it went up against all the other movies I went up against I love She's All That I'll go watch it right now and enjoy it thoroughly. It is not an Elite 8 and that is my problem with see. Did you give it? It's an eight.  Conduit a couple years ago. They were an eight seed and then when the whole goddamn thing if this one so cutter thing, I regret everything I've done here and it's got but it's not going to because guess what it's up against.  Philadelphia Story, no, you know that loss of the first round. You're just poking me down puts it up against clueless. Oh, that's a good one. Even though clueless isn't even a rom-com. So I think she's all that wind.  That's it's up against clueless. I think that it wins because clueless is not an actual rom-com. I don't even know if the Romantic lot storyline and clue is more than ten minutes of the movie. It's illegal. Also, can we just talk about or is there some questionable she is 16. She is 16 and he is in college look guys. That's her stepbrother. He's in college you thought I got pissed off at Never Been Kissed. Yeah, that's true.  This is shady shit going on. I'm sure Sheriff Cher Horowitz and Josh. He doesn't even have a last name. It's just Josh. I think he is in a KU basketball hat or just a KU hat, but honestly, there's a lot to question about that movie and sure it's a classic as well. I'm not surprised clueless made it. I'm just upset that. It's going to get a really easy Road and I think it's a sketchy movie.  And he's all that advances your you're really wrong on this. This is a landslide could go the rest of these are landslides except for one geniality Miss Congeniality also made it. Well, that's one of the classic rom-com. No, it's not. No, you know that it's not and you even weren't even sure it should be in here because the romance in that with the FBI agent is minimal. So it's constant banter its back and forth to sexual tension builds for a full hour and a half before they  We got it on. No. Absolutely. This is not a rom-com. Absolutely. This is that it's very bare minimum of a rom-com. It's too good their veteran neither of which have an illegal profession either which pay for each other's company. You just know that you just know it's going to get it's going up against pretty well. Oh shit. What do you know about that?  Good talk about your hooker. I have nothing bad to say about Pretty Woman. It's a classic and you know what? This is the problem. We can't start going into like obviously pretty woman has its issues looking back now, but if we start to dissect it, it's a terrible movie. No, it's not terrible movie. There's some questionable moments, but like honestly at least she's of age at yourself on the back for that.  Wretch I don't I don't care. I know I just think pretty woman. She fell on Hard Times. She found the guy who loved her for her and she called his money. No, she only got $3,500. They negotiated. I just want your extra time and your  Kiss and $3,500. Yeah, and she got that but then he and some outfits and then he came back for.  Not with the Opera Coming Out musical. Yeah, it actually has some musical moments. She goes she goes to the Opera it was all right. I almost believe it's beating Miss Congeniality. Come on. All right. This one is honest to God Love Actually 100% should still be here. I'm fine with love actually still being the lead eight. It's a lot. It's a different movie. It's a different kind of style and another musical number.  And Hugh Grant dancing, which I enjoyed so I'm going to let this one slide and who doesn't love all I want for Christmas.  The holiday no, no, well, it's going up against that but I'm saying they sing All I want for Christmas is you that was actually not that either. I mean it was no Mariah, but well, I didn't say I was trying to be variety. I'm gonna be well, we're gonna name our child Mariah right? It's going up against the holiday, which you guys  I think some of you are really confused here and I think maybe the holiday is obvious obvious movie in this whole thing that it's just like really this is what is this is what you consider to be the Elite 8 the holiday, it's clever. It's cute. Whatever Jack Black I enjoy his character. I could look at Jewel all day long.  Did you say it's the most borrowed movie? Yeah, it literally got I knew it was going to ruin I should have never put it in the brackets actually know if this is what beat When Harry Met Sally which is maybe more upsetting than people like it why you mad that people like it because they're wrong. Okay, you know like and I think you all we just need to have a moment and I I knew that I should have forced family fun some of these movies leading up to my  Rom-com March Madness, but I didn't want to people off to what I was doing. So I was like, okay, I'm not going to start promoting these movies and talk about why they're so great and I should have I should have led you all in the right direction. And that's on me. That's on me. Is this movie shouldn't have beat When Harry Met Sally  Never never ever ever ever. So I'm just upset about it. I'm just  it's whatever like obviously Cameron Diaz can cry. Like what is that story line? I haven't cried and ten years. It's like suddenly she's crying in the cab and she's a really bad crier. It just comes to her like that like how dumb I don't know you speak very passionately about it. Sounds like it's a good movie again. You haven't seen it. So no so and then our final seating which actually worked out kind of funny How to Lose a Guy in ten days and ten things.  About you the rule 10, uh-huh, you know, I don't know if I care which either one makes it here. How to Lose a Guy in ten days. I wasn't surprised made it this far just because it's always on E and it just seems to be like a wrong Comcast Cana. Hey in Kate sure. I vote for McConaughey on this one. Yeah, I mean 10 Things I Hate About You is a I wouldn't be upset with either one just because I  I hope that it would lose to Love Actually in the final four and that it's going to be clueless and pretty woman in the final four and God only knows what you all have to I honestly  I have a feeling coulis is winning this whole thing.  I don't think clueless makes it to the final four. I think you're so wrong that you think she's all that is. What wins here. Okay, let's see. All right. So up next is bills favorite subject. You were the one who actually encouraged us to record after tonight's premiere of Keeping Up with the Kardashians and I will say for someone who is having a real hard time committing to Game of Thrones really can't tune in.  To New York or Beverly Hills tonight. He says you know what? I guess I won't go play my video game so I can kind of know what's going on. When the podcast happens. I was like Kardashians. This is this is where you're going to join in.  Yeah, so that's Kings clay why two glasses and you can stand vaguely paying attention to the Kardashians. Well, here's the thing just to back it up for what you're saying because that's not really a fair representation of it. All King. Game of Thrones is 55 hours. I just I well that's how much we have left. I can't commit to 55 hours of Television, but I can read in 15 minutes on Wikipedia. It's just it doesn't make sense to me and I don't know all the information the bed.  We housewive Hills and the New Yorkers. Do you do enough recap on your story that when I'm in the other room playing my video games. I can just watch like five total minutes of your story, you know, everything that's happening and those shows so I'm well-versed in all of that Kardashian's I could not care less about anyone in this family to the point where if no one ever said the name Kardashian again, I wouldn't even know that it was a name in the first place. Like I wouldn't even miss hearing that name. So that been said, I'm so disinterested in  In it kind of like how you were with this last season the bachelor that I have to be around it. If you want me to have any sort of been put on I know but you didn't you you said you didn't care much and it ended up being something you really enjoyed that not so you're gonna ask you what but I would not watch her story about the Kardashians. I don't read when you were reviewing the Jordan shit. I think I ignored you for two weeks on social media. That's not true. And and new know because the Jordan thing happened I was almost  The 20,000 and I was just looking through all that stuff again kind of reliving the moment. They're just the worst now. We're going to review this without you going down a deep dark hole of Despair. Like I need you to either decide if you're going to be quiet or if you're going to engage my commentary without your only comment being the worst. I don't know if I can guarantee either of those things until I hear said commentary. All right. Well, first of all a lot of the people who  Recently follow me joined in when the Jordan would Saga began earlier mid-February. And obviously we know going into this season or we knew going into this season that that timing is a little off and we're not going to get Jordan Kylie Tristan Chloe drama that being said the trailer that came out this week before the premiere tonight was all about Kylie Jordan Tristan.  Who's the other one Chloe drama, and I know that we're only going to get that in the last five minutes of the finale really? It's all gonna just be that's going to be the actual moment, but I'm here for it. I'm glad they're back. Like it's a Sunday night thing for me. I don't need much from them. I enjoy just getting a little pieces of them. But Larsa was on tonight, of course luckily. They didn't do a cameo or interview or whatever.  Her but she's thirsty sucking the life out of everything Malik is a little all over the place closed or Courtney's just depressed. Khloe is still in a relationship with Tristan. And then honestly, the whole episode was really about Kanye which was new for a new fan like yourself and me. Well, it makes sense. Think about it going into the season. They had absolutely nothing you  elf said this season is going to be abysmal. They have nothing going on camera. No, you said they had nothing to talk about you said that they had nothing going for them. And so they said all right. Look Kanye like we gotta get you on because we have nothing to talk about and you're kind of an untapped resource. So do you mind like putting some of your story in Cotton? He's like, yeah, I get paid off this so let's do it. That's not what I think happened here. Okay, that's fine. We'll get to yours in a second and then this Jordan  And Tristan thing all went down and they're like, okay we can edit this in and make all this happen. So now they're going to start with all the Kanye stuff that they originally thought slowly. You're going to see a lot more footage of Jordan probably by episode three or four she's going to start getting a lot more face time. So everyone resonates with her and gets to know more about her character until boom. They're going to come up Swinging with the finale or the last couple episodes which will be fun because right when shit gets good with Kardashian and they're all sleeping around Game of Thrones.  Thrones is it going to be getting ready to end their run and they're going to come on arrival times and it will be very fun to see which one is like leading the Twitter war Game of Thrones and I know but just for all the people out there like you that are big into this Jordan Woods thing. Hello. I won't care like okay never mind. I thought you're going to have a different reaction to 100% know like people are going to die on Game of Thrones like like the world is ending as we know it on Game of Thrones like who's more fake the characters and Game of Thrones or the people on  But the Kardashians that's probably a fair question.  I don't know if it's a fair question. Very fair question. I mean  We don't know what world Game of Thrones is in bright. We can't call them fake or not. The Kardashians are more fake. No, then the characters on Game of Thrones. No, obviously those are real people live in Calabasas. I yes, obviously those are real people. Am I invested more? So in Jon Snow and Khaleesi and like they're in sexual relationship, of course.  Like right now. Yeah, the drama of the Kardashians is real in two weeks. I will tune in to the Kardashians not probably on Monday nights when I get home. Maybe I'll watch on the treadmill Monday mornings on my fitness journey, but I will be watching her - or Game of Thrones live. Hmm and then we will be going into recording an episode about Game of Thrones. So yeah Kardashians falls to the Wayside for  Six weeks solid. Yeah, but the only times I've heard all day. Yeah, that's why you have to start watching Game of Thrones. I already know what happens. I read it. I read the books. Oh, no, you didn't read a book. I heard the Wikipedia's. Yeah. So anyway, so this week's episode interesting. I'm not disagreeing with your theory that they are going to re-edit and rework because they probably cut some  Jordan things and some Tristan things and they're definitely both in scenes, but they're going to Pepper them back in so it feels a little more like boom shit. Look what happened is I do think last season of the Kardashians. The big criticism was everyone knew what was going on with the Kardashians because they posted all in their social media. Everything was already out there. Even the little things even business things or whatever. I do think they try for more of a privacy route. They deleted all their  Before this season not that I don't know anyone who had their apps, but I think this stuff is the public stuff but it's the behind-the-scenes reaction to Chloe finding out this story or Kylie finding out her best friend of ten years is shitty person. I think that's the stuff. They kept hidden. Well this season that it might not even be in the season but will be in second season and or next season season 17, but that will get a little more Taste of  Does any part of you think they might have fabricated the whole Jordan Tristan saga? No, you don't think that they it's a they puppeteered this whole thing. No, I thought that during it at some points. But at this point with Jada Pinkett-Smith unfollowing them all this week. I think Jordan is being very oh and then there was a you've got no male this Instagram account. He just moved to London part-time and he has been following this a lot and he ran into Jordan because  Runs in London and she just said, you know, it was a very vague conversation, but you can go to his Instagram and he posted just the text that he sent to a friend being like Oh my God. This is what she said and stuff. But I mean, I think I think Jordan was living in Kylie Shadow. I think some guy some shitty guy. Tristan is the worst also in news this week. Tristan is dming some 17 year old.  She's look 17 but he sliding into her DM's. Tristan is the worst like the worst. I mean, we have Kris Humphries to reference. We have dark days of Scott. We have a lot of shitty guys at these people have different Montana. I mean not that French was the worst. He didn't even matter, but I'm just saying like Tristan is scum. He's some 27 year old basketball player who just does not believe the rules would apply to him. I mean he  Literally went with a stripper and hooker random girl in the bar. I don't know when Chloe was due in three days. Oh, maybe he bought her clothes and they fell in love. Yeah. No, no, no leave pretty woman alone. Now, we took the I mean like a Khloe kind of got this guy not in a questionable. I don't know if it was a questionable way, but he left his pregnant girlfriend for Khloe and then he cheated on Khloe and she was literally almost put her into labor.  It's shitty guys and we all can't keep thinking we can change guys and people need to stop thinking they can change Tristan Thompson because Jordan Woods, you know, she sat on the armchair of his chair and her legs touched his and nothing happened, but then she kissed him goodbye, but I don't even want to get into that the friendly tongue kiss right now. There was no tongue. That was the one specification but you know, he's also like 7 foot tall and she's five foot like it gives you a few minutes to think maybe they shouldn't have  Still maybe they shouldn't happen to him. He still hasn't reached me yet. Maybe I should pull away like she had a little while to think know so I think Jordan shady, I think Tristan shady. I think we had to Shady people not in maybe Jordans not shady. I think Jordan is tired of living in a shadow and think she can do it on her own and she can't and she ruined a billion-dollar friendship that a lot of us would appreciate. You know, I'm excited to see how they line up this season. I always know the show is pretty  Castrated but it is their lives. Also. I don't think Khloe Kardashian wants her baby. Daddy cheating on her when she's got a one-year-old at home. No, I don't think that part was orchestrated some of these storylines. Sure Kim and Kourtney haired she want to put it on TV. You don't have a choice at this point contract wise, this is your and that's what she says and this I mean you you do this so much your contract is I mean, you can go lock yourself in the bathroom. They could probably just by the E network.  And then edit it out if I wanted to sure they only Network at this that's what I'm saying is their contract is contracted to themselves. They're just Marxist. It's Ryan Seacrest will hold them to it. Ryan Seacrest is always making money. Hi guys. I'm back and I'm back on with anchor.

Well, so they have more going on than just Keeping Up with the Kardashians tomorrow or Monday the or maybe it's the  It's April 1st or April 2nd Courtney's random, whatever. I don't know poosh poosh the lifestyle. That's a Kardashian thing. I know you've been talking. Yes, it's Courtney's so and I'm not going to remember who messaged me this I'm so sorry. I'll tag you when I figure out the tax, but someone messaged me and I posted on the my story last week.  Going through tag pictures of poosh for an account that only just started and I wondered how I was already following it when it started. They took - the old they had a clothing store - they took the old - account because - is closed and they change it to poosh. And so all these pictures are tagged really far back for something like five years ago. So someone was smart enough Kris Jenner to take the old - Instagram because Courtney would never Garner.  Many followers otherwise because it's a stupid. I don't even know what it is. I think it supposed to be goop. I think it's supposed to be like Gwyneth Paltrow's goop. You know what that is. Yeah, didn't they have a TV show about that - this is how I mean, I went belly up. I think they Dash dolls for a little bit too. But then they have like a brick and mortar in Miami know they had stores and they might have had a little yeah, they had - I don't know that company folded. Yeah - is done. So then Courtney took the Instagram handle.  And has made push which it just sounds like douche or PooPourri but a different name for PooPourri like and the image like Pooch like a little belly. Yeah, push like and it says push the boundaries like push your pants. Yeah, it sure sounds like it just and all the images like there was one with like oranges on the ground. It was two feet standing over the laundress. It's like did she push those oranges out of her but like it just is  I don't understand it. I'm not totally curious about it. But like tomorrow it sounds like it could be a good like clothing line for toddlers or like newborn. Well, it says it's lifestyle and Penelope her daughter. That's her nickname push. Okay, like Scott calls are Pooch. So that's where it comes from but it's not really good lifestyle. Like if it's a beauty product like you just think of like a like dirty. I don't know push just feels like a weird like  cleaning. Yeah moment something that they would use to describe refresh products. Yeah. Yeah. Like I said PooPourri, so not sure oh but the next quick Kardashian thing before we move on. We'd love to hear what you have last week. You said you would come back to us with some church of Kanye research true. I did I  I talked to my sources. I did some internet Googling and research now my initial feedback on the situation was I thought that they were doing practicing for like a cat or something. I thought that he was kind of doing going to announce a world tour something. This was going to be part of it. You're about to butcher this but am I like but then it came to light he announced on an airplane over PA system that he would actually playing coach.  Oh this year. So it seems like he's gonna be taking this church of Kanye concept to Coachella, which I didn't know this but he was supposed to be headlining Coachella, but he demanded having a domed stage in the middle of the crowd and they wanted to comply with it. So they removed him from Coachella, but now they are going to take the Church of Kanye Sunday. What's it called Sunday sessions first, it's Easter. No, I know but the hashtag.  Sunset scare doing now, but they're only playing the second weekend, which is happens to be Easter Sunday. So he's taking his little gospel really kind of cool looking thing. They got going on and playing Coachella with it. My next question would be who is your Source on all this fight. Never reveal my sources drop me to read over your sword. No because you don't even know my sources. No, you told me earlier who your Source was, it's me, so that surprised look on.  Your face when I Just Dropped a Bomb about him announcing on a plane that you told me that I'm the one who posted it earlier today and I said look kindly on a plane and his hair was different that no and then you go. Yeah, you're my source on all this like you literally said I have other sources you just confirm them. No. No, I'm your Source or and I know you weren't watching Kardashian stories today. Nope, so I have other sources. No.  Me you told me I was the source sure. He's going to try and twist this guy's but he I am his Source. I'm still proud that you sold that like you did some research this week. I brought it up to you today. Just being like hey, remember you promised everyone that you're going to come back with some stuff. And you said yeah what's going on with that and I explained it to you stupidly and then you just took all my words and put them out as  Your story just then not really sure what you're getting out of calling me out on this one, but we can I don't know I enjoy with that. I enjoyed it. Honestly. I just wanted to make sure people knew the truth.  Next time I give you an assignment. I hope you can do it on your own rather than forget. I'll just go back through your news feed and start tagging some truths in there. Oh everyone get ready Phyllis tagging truth in my newsfeed. Whatever the hell that means. I'm excited. I'm excited to see what truths you're spilling. Let's go. All right, we'll move off the Kardashians just because I can tell you've done your research this week and your little done.  And we'll move on to some TV shows this week. So we actually haven't talked about this at all. And we should because this is the one show you do watch and you do enjoy chopped. No talk about cha. We watched a great Thanksgiving episode this week that's still on our DVR. We forgot that one no Vanderpump Rules. So we're going to get into Vanderpump Rules which Bill actually watches.  It's the only show you really do watch from Bravo consistently we moved in together. How long ago I don't know why I just looked at the clock so few minutes ago. We just moved into this place. Uh-huh. But when the first or when that last season it was Jax and Faith all that drama. It was the first episode of that and Bill kind of walks in the living room and walked out and kept being like, what is this little curious?  And then sat down it was hooked. Maybe we've decided it's probably because we've worked in the industry and and everyone we know in the industry loves this show like things it's hilarious all these drunk messes of humans and Jax is obviously just a treat but this season has been okay nothing too crazy, but this week I found it very enjoyable. Which prior well  We thought it was enjoyable a they're going on a trip again because you know, no one they all pretend like they work at this restaurant. But for how many employees are leaving on a given basis this place would be crumbling but our big thing and I went on a rant this week about it was the Katie and Tom fight and you had some insight into that and were annoyed with it because  in a in a way we've lived in this like you were managing a bar working how many hours crazy schedule and he is part owner God only knows how much and this restaurant and Katie is you know, missing some attention. He's obviously a lot busier because God only knows what Tom Schwartz did with his free time before I'm not sure how much he and Sandoval are doing right now. I think Katie goes into work.  Once a week just for filming purposes. So this might be a little bit of an orchestrated storyline that they don't have a lot of time together, whatever but this fight felt pretty I don't think it is orchestrated. I think they both seem very unreasonable. I think he's a mess to begin with but I know I didn't watch the old episodes. So I don't know when Katie was what from what I understand a monster but rage rage text. Yeah.  She's showing a couple of times this season that her true colors last season. She was pretty nice and seemed like she was on the comeback Trail making amends with people and she just me seemed cool. You know this season. She kind of seemed I'm seeing that kind of bitchy psychopath that you say she used to be in the previous well because she had it out with James which I get that James was way out of line, but you know, she made such a point gave Lisa an ultimatum then she had it out with Sandoval and Sandoval.  Sandoval had some really good points because Katie kind of acted terrible and then Sandoval's like you can totally be a bitch to everyone and say whatever you want anyone but one person says something to you and you try to ruin his life like they're you know, there's to add two sides that sword Katie, you know, now you just kind of get in karma coming back to you and now she's getting mad at her husband because dudes working his ass off opening a restaurant. She's begging him for attention during that so immediately, you know, it's an uphill battle. She's fighting she should know it's not build battle. It's not fair because I'm sure that  He would and I can tell you right now because I did it for a long time a hundred percent would rather be spending time with her then at work working his ass off dealing with a lot of nonsensical bullshit. Well, and I just think a we don't know really like  Different schedule and who knows how much he was really working and stuff, but it did come off that I mean when they did start this fight this fight escalated because she was rage texting him when he and scheana got upgraded to First Class. Yeah, which was the amazing part. And of course, it's scheana Tom there's shorts and she was like switch seats with me and he goes no and then you could tell by how the camera was panning back between his phone her him asleep her. She was the drinking.  She was getting drunk and sending him angry texts the whole time. So then they get to the hotel you stand on that. No, I've never flown first class. I don't believe you have either have you.  No, I feel private. Oh, I don't know you've been on a PJ once but PJ, I'm stassi. So one time it was an accident if I had gotten upgraded to first class and I was like, I wouldn't be shocked if I would say switch with me. If you didn't I wouldn't be like, yeah pretend to already be asleep right guy. I would I would suggest it and see if like, all right, maybe without you had a list of an argument on the way to a vague there was obviously issues and like you said shorts  I can't imagine dating Schwartz first like he's a very to married to like we have to give Katie a little credit here because he's kind of a mess. I just think it was the Catalyst for this whole thing and there was a lot of other underlying things but they get back to the room. There's like a full blown out fight like and he says some stuff that yeah makes it not so he doesn't sound like he wants to hang out with her. It doesn't sound like he wants to be around her not there now and she's acting like that, but also just like I don't have time.  For you, I don't like the sound of your voice. Like I don't like the sound of her voice either, but I'm not married to her. Yeah, like if you said that to me, I'd be like but also what's a lot of the offseason they don't show like maybe he works 12 hours at the bar and then comes home and she's giving him a hard time for waking her up. The two babies coming home late, and she's giving him a hard time.  All of them and make them a face of this and it continues her Legacy in a clever way. I I question how much they're involved and I think a lot of Schwartz's maybe working for his part ownership. All right, Sam just doing at the bar. I think he's just you know, and I'd be annoyed to be doing a promotion tour let people know what's in there. Yeah, he's just going, you know, all three bars are next to each other and I think that is frustrating on Katie's part, but I think she just  Looked like Katie just gets in a drunk stage where she's shouting shouting shouting and he is just like you said your voice. Yeah, but he said you have the EQ of a fourteen-year-old the IQ. He's an EQ. Alright it is he cute but people were messaging me saying I think that stands for emotional intelligence and it doesn't somebody else told me he might have thought it does but someone else who was a psychology something. I don't remember.  Said it's not EQ. It's like ET or weird something not with it. You would think but that's probably what he meant. She's the emotional intelligence of a 14 year old their relationship is just a mess and then they filmed that also happened this week. The reunions was getting filmed so we know the reunions being filmed right now. We kind of saw the seating arrangement its boughs first from reunions Lisa was there looking fabulous and the  only drama we've gotten is Jax has tweeted a bunch saying it was the most insane reunions. They've ever had like biggest fights biggest drama everything and then Kristen Instagram storied something really vague about like don't break my wings or I don't even know so sounds like she was under the attack which I'm surprised because I mean Carter is the problem there. So I wonder I don't know how to get her off the show. I hope that this is her swans.  I mean she's a fun mess, but she brings nothing to the table. Just the thing is we're all deeply attached to Kristen right again. I'm not because of what I mean Kristen Kristen's connection to all of this like Christian was with Sandoval then Christian slept with Jax Kristen. You keep saying Christian. Oh, sorry Kristen. I think I said Kristen Kristen slept with Jax who was dating stassi her best friend and then Kristen laughs or to cheat on Sandoval with Jane's.  Then she brings that's how James gets into the group. I mean and then James she hates James as passionate about James. It's all a beautiful mess and so much of it stems from Kristin. I mean, she knows the real Catalyst of this entire show like we wouldn't be here without scheana but really, yeah, that's how Beverly Hills started Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. This was how they like intro to you in Brandi was this housewife and that who was her husband who is now married to  Not Jule, who's the singer? That's blonde like Jewels LeAnn Rimes. Goddamnit. Yahoo! Your drives. Are you got there? I'm so proud of you. So Brandy was married to Eddie Cibrian Eddie cheated on Brandy with a Hostess or a server at Vanderpump and I happen to be Sheena it was scheana so they segmented literally the episode didn't even stop a real housewife of Beverly Hills and it went into this thing and everyone was like what's going on? Where are we there was no commercial anything and that it was  Long episode they went into Vanderpump Rules and it was through Sheena and everything and because Lisa was a housewife and intro in it in and that's how we got to Vanderpump Rules. So Vanderpump Rules already show and they know the story line about scheana. No, there was no no there was no show yet Bill no through a question. So at some point this season, they're going to segue into Vanderpump dogs for this whole fucking dog scenario that they've been building up and suddenly you're just going to be watching Vanderpump college and not realize it because  cuz to repot a fucking dog or to know what but we're to know I know they're going to segment into Vanderpump dogs. I mean that's happening. I don't even care again fabricated story. Like this have fabricated no streets definitely terrible human and got this dog and listen idiot about it. He did what he told her to do it a promote their shows no way and he doesn't mess with them. No, he doesn't need to this drama all happens. Then he just fires people. He doesn't want to be too close to a mall and tell him what you do but this weekend they  Did have Vanderpump Vegas open at Caesar's Palace and supposedly there were cameras there and all the cast was all there all the Tom's all the Jacks for there were cameras. They had Mike's on so fingers crossed. We are getting a Vanderpump Vegas. Like I know I think the an episode though. I want to show but we don't even know the character. That's fine. We got a new show. Yes, you can.  Don't doubt yourself like that. They don't know Vegas. Are you kidding? Yeah, and probably I was thinking all the Lohan Beach people who like God off Lohan beach and came back because so many of them were working in Vegas. Lisa would do well to tap into a few of those to come over for her scheana's got a show in Vegas about her sex life or something and she could go she is which Lisa says she's her best employee sure. She did so I don't know. I'm pumped for Vanderpump Vegas, whatever.  Happens there. Mmm-hmm.  So  Bleeding from Vanderpump Rules. Obviously we can kind of segmented right into it Real Housewives of Beverly Hills not too much this week. I mean, we obviously only mentioned the dog 200 times which is a lot less than most weeks. Now, the big story of this week was actually Denise Richards getting married and it was everything Denise Richards is so I don't give a fuck that it does not belong.  Beverly Hills but it's making Beverly Hills bearable right now her whole style like she literally her daughter comes down to cannot walk in her high heels her six-year-old daughter and she's like Mom. Can I just go put tennis shoes on to go down the aisle to the wedding hall was I don't care. I'm gonna shit do what you want did he's like sure does not care. Her daughter comes out in her dress and tennis shoes and they all walk down the aisle together as a family to get married. I mean and she walks down the ire fire.  That what was the wine again? They walk down the aisle to like some heavy metal song. I mean it comes on everyone's like all right, Denise Richards like you do you she just she just like yeah, I had a great time. This is fun. Let's do it again sometime Lisa Rinna made a good point. There were camera Crews or helicopters and Paparazzi and everything everywhere and people are like how annoying like how rude that the paparazzi's  To get shots Lisa Rinna goes, you know, you know, you're still doing okay, if you live here and somebody does show up to take a picture if they don't that's when you got to go poke another gig. So I'll give credit to render this week, even though she and I are on the outs with Charlie there. No, she invited him though. He was there. Yeah, no heat they have two daughters together. But yeah, she invited him. Otherwise this week was pretty I mean Lisa Vanderpump.  Was friendly with everyone at the party. Teddy was talking to her during her we're totally fine. We end the episode with this article has been leaked to probably write our online again, I think and it's you know Drita has hurt Lisa by neglecting this dog and giving up this dog in the whole story was leaked and treats like pay cash. I take a oh my God. What if people think I'm  A dog abuser and it's like a nobody nobody reads radar. We only read radar because of the what voice were you just do that's dorit's pecan pie goodness. No, I don't know but I know she has like 27 different acts. That wasn't what you were trying to do Lisa Vanderpump, and I wasn't sure because I was joking tag me this that's what yeah. Okay, PK. Okay. That's how she does it. Okay. I mean, I'm going to listen back to this. It's not going to be exactly what I thought I heard.  Heard and wait to hear it. Uh-huh. But yeah, so she talks but she's really upset and he PK obviously, it's like definitely Lisa leaked this and guess what? I don't think she did and radar has said it wasn't Lisa who leaked it. I wouldn't be surprised if one of the other ones leave did the try to make a story like Lisa Rinna I just ran on might have done it to sabotage Lisa Vanderpump. I didn't well I read this. I also read  Just a few minutes ago because I was trying to recap in my mind what had happened and somebody tweeted that or something Kyle responded that being like that might be the craziest rumor. I've heard that Rena leaked it to make the storyline about Lisa and you guys my whole Theory at this point now is because I've been very much. I I stand Lisa those who are award I support Lisa Vanderpump still I'm still just  I don't know. I don't I just think.  While yes, there's some parts of her story that I'm a little mmm on and she has done some stuff like this before no one else is story is matching up enough for me to go. Oh shit. No one's I mean Teddy has changed her story a thousand times Dury. Honestly, no one should even tell anybody about the second dog for half of the I mean, it just doesn't make sense. Yes. They have Lisa Vanderpump.  Boggs is a thing that's going to happen. I don't know if it was going to before and then we had New York this week. Which nothing crazy there.  Dorinda's is well, you know Barbara should have an apple by now. We don't know why Barbara the tool woman doesn't have an apple. She is in every scene at this point. They've called out during de and Luann have met up. They went to lunch with Bethenny and Barbara karynda does not think she heckled the Giovanni show Luann is on her high horse and is going to kind of draw.  Like this whole thing out and then Durand adjust goes on a rampage against Barbara and the end of the episode be like get out of my house. Get out of my house bitch Barbers trying to talk to her about Louis and and being like, you know, she's hurt. You're hurt. No, that's why I think to do with it. There's not much there. I mean, they're probably just giving Barbara trial run to see if she's going to be interesting enough to give her an Apple for next season's probably a tryout for her. Well, they have before like midseason put them in camps.  NEOS and giving them stuff. So I'm wondering if that's what's going to happen. I don't just like Barbara. I think Barbara's doing what Denise is doing in Beverly Hills. It's just enough of a difference that she stands out in a good way. But I don't know. I think people are people are divided on if New York's good right now if it's kind of boring, I'm into New York just because we like you said last week. It's not the same storyline each episode. Bethenny has her own shit right now.  Tim's more Ramona and Sonja you need the I think that they need that those two are just like they're just well Ramona is like hugging Bethany when she sees her and be like, I want to say, I'm sorry for your loss. It's like Ramona, you're going to have a real tough reunions after the shit you said last week and now this week being like I feel so bad for her. It's like bitch. You are the worst. I don't need any more Ramona - yeah.  Yeah. Oh, I always need more Sonja though. Sonja's rocking this bump it right now. It's like a hair piece that goes make your care in here bigger. Yeah, so but she's like she's got extensions and she's really into them and it you know, it's kind of like seeing dorit's hair in the same style for too long leader eat are so extreme son. Just had this now for like five episodes and she still got it like in right now like,  Her Instagram. She's posting things with this long long long down to her butt hair in this one big bump it I mean, it's literally Amy Winehouse style beehive happening here. There's probably more to Real Housewives of New York that I'm forgetting.  But I think it's going to get better. I think it only gets more dramatic with all of them. So I think New York is going to pick up. I think it's a little not slow right now. I just oh that was the other thing Sonia just out of nowhere at the beginning of this episode, which we knew was coming at her party just starts. I've know where this woman comes out. It's like so yeah waves tour and then they just start making out. Yeah, just out of nowhere to sleep at that one. I know I don't know how I forgot that.  It was out of nowhere. It was so funny because every I mean Bethany ever was like someone just waves to her out of nowhere. They start making up making out the woman just walks off. I mean there was no there was no hello conversation nothing. So can I come kiss you so undergoes sure walks out quick it was but that's what Sonia gives and that's what New York like, I don't know.  I think New York right now just has enough humor. Beverly Hills feels very heavy - Denise. So to be continued on both of those. I think we're only I mean Beverly Hills next week is headed into a shit storm with Kyle and Lisa. That's the big glove fight. They intro the season with and then New York. I think we're headed into, you know during a seems a little lost right now and obsessed with the whole Luann thing, but I think Luann's gonna her ego is getting  Bigger and bigger and bigger and Bethenny's about to do the whole life is not a cabaret it salt so that's what we're working towards and then the only other thing Bravo we have coming this week. We heard Southern Charm is delayed and because of the Thomas Ravenel drama and then the next day we got the Southern Charm trailer. It looks delicious. I love Southern Charm  Ashley makes a quick appearance. I don't think it's much from what I had heard on the blogs and everything Travis nothing. Thank goodness Shep looks like he's going to be an asshole but I just love Shep. So I just don't really care. Naomi's new hot boyfriend in the trailer makes an appearance and then there is a comment that Kathryn and Whitney were hooking up during the summer, you know, nothing about southern.  I'm interested in this whole Catherine Whitney situation. Whitney is a guy. I'm sorry, I mean moving right along. Well, that's all I had. I guess we'll end on that. Yeah, so it should be a good week. We're gonna head into the elite eight and the final four. We're going to head in the final four in March Madness actual March Madness to which let me just tell you the joy it brings me.  That duke-north Carolina and Kentucky roll out. Someone message me. They're like, please talk about it on your podcast. So that's my pick my quick.  Statement about that. I'm thrilled. I'm cheering for Auburn and Texas Tech if they play each other.  I feel like I'd lean Big 12 just out of allegiance to the Big 12, but also Kansas loss to Auburn so wouldn't it be nice to just say we lost the best team in the country and not feel so bad the flip side to that is if Texas Tech or Michigan State wins it they play each other then Kansas can say they beat the eventual champion at during the regular season. So you beat Michigan State at the Champions classic and you beat Texas Tech.  So really three out of four of these teams, you have a right to be cool with I really don't want Virginia to win their the only one that can't win. Yeah. Only one. Everything is ruined for genuine everything the whole. Yeah. You're right Elsie's whole. She's in my sister over. Yeah. I'm you know, I'm ready to move on to golf. I'm not ready for baseball or stuff, but I'm ready to move on to Spring Sports, you know next week.  We'll have right before will have National Championship to talk about on both sides will have some more TV to talk about and anything else this week that you're going to research since you were assigned to the Kanye Church of Kanye drama. Anything else you want to take on this week - Game of Thrones. No, no, nothing great the farm. No. Okay. Well great. Well then.

This only works. If you have a sibling, if you don't then just move it on step 6. Tell him you did something only for your sibling and that you didn't do anything for them. Then they'll feel very bad for you and get you what you want. If you sibling does this back to you just do it right again step 6. Tell them you did something special and really amazing and they'll think that you should be rewarded for.  The legend dead if you didn't do anything special you could I don't know if this is the right thing to say, but you could probably make something up and they'll think that you get very rewarding and that you deserve it. So some examples could be getting everything right on a test or winning a baseball game. If you don't do anything like that, then you can just probably make something up.  I really hope this works for you doesn't work then. I'm very sorry. I only did six steps. I didn't do every single step in the world and still be way too long. I did six steps. That's all so I really hope this works out.	This is the easiest way to get what you want from someone.  Just tell them how good they look and tell them what you wanna get.

No, he's not an artist. Let's let's be real this man.  Has had three good songs in the past and two of them the features carried him when most of the music you can barely hear the words. I don't think you classify as an artist. So well, we watched him. It wasn't really concert catchy. He just I just don't understand when you play your first song Your Best song first hear those words are often either rookie move. Yes, then immediately.  Slowly piece by piece taking off clothing immediately to undresses. What are the odds are train comes by recording studio. What is odds we're in downtown Hollywood and then a train track come by. Sorry about that guys.  He kind of is like Fela skele-toes had their run. Let's be real there Davi ever. See you or person you hike it. I'm just trying to justify. Oh, yeah. I had a bear but you had a pair of those all I can think about the nicer one all I think about when someone says skeletons is like water shoes. Yeah slip your toes in them. That was where the weird kids in school that were the water shoes like and water shoes and shirt swimmers. Yes shirts were members of the words like it.  Fat just own. It just don't want to sure it's okay, like nobody's gonna say I think like nobody's really gonna judge you. Maybe they will they're awful people. There should be a separate pool for sure swimmers. Yes, that's disgusting. Like how do you get out of a pool with a wet shirt on what kind of psycho is wanted to watch? You might roll t-shirt and some jeans and go to like a kid rock you sure you ever seen a kids swimming genes that also absolutely  We swim in genes that it's blue jeans to be exactly they re they were skinnier bag Levi's no rather know Brett Favre Wrangler. I'm talking Levi right lengthen with what you thinking 28. Nah this dude. Probably 24 26 may be any man. Yeah sure kid short man Buzz  Put from hell, so you're saying essentially they would be sure it's on a regular person. I'm nice. Yeah, that's good. Rule. Number one guys. If you're going to shave your head don't do it the shower and try to put it down the drain. Yeah, we didn't do that.  It's not a good move. Not a good move. Not even we're just speaking solely based on what we know from a friend's experience our call you back on those blue jeans through the short version. Jeez. I mean because George were making a comeback not long anywhere, but how about our friend? Uh, should we say tonight? Yeah, we can say is named Drake. Oh, yeah. He's when George died two weeks ago. Yeah like with an Alabama Jersey, which was I would say question will fit but  School is okay. Yeah. Yeah. I mean Jake's fly dude. He's got a middle part. So yeah floor really argue with him. He's definitely a cultured got well-rounded traveled man traveled make mountain biking mountain biking is his way to go see an $11 movie with us, but one of us to buy a $350 bikes we go mountain biking anybody that goes mountain biking. I mean, I feel like it's okay if you just go mountain biking but if you want those weirdos that are making  In your own Trails. She's trying too hard man, Matt. Just go to somebody else's trails with some buddies are made of exactly their natural made a lot of time. Like why are you making them? It seems like a lot of work to ride for 15 minutes. I'll tell you what mountain bike wheels thick Wheels thick Wheels. You cannot ride those on the street. You should know thick Wheels. I mean, imagine get one of those ran up on your leg as a kid. Yeah, or like somebody graze in your back wheel. You know that  Those are the worst of the worst kid that if you were that kid growing up. I hope you Dad a child and middle school. Yeah, I hope you brought well, most of them probably did. Yeah, no longer has a gene. Where's in the pool? Yo, you're in jail right now? Yeah, you brought up some form of domestic violence for sure some point. Yeah. She's even talk about that movie. We saw speaking of that allows a great movie. I'm honestly joke.  Sir, I don't know who was talking about that. It was like bad, but it was literally one of the best movies I've seen in like this year. You're gonna move in here for me. Maybe the year that you ain't seen one spend time in Hollywood have you know, I haven't seen okay. I don't know if it has to go to the movies for me. I'm scared. Somebody's gonna ruin it for me, and I'm sorry so late. I might as well. Yeah. I mean we can't go wrong with Tarantino every but speaking of Joker.  Did the movie even happen? I think I think it did. We probably shouldn't get in this gonna sound really spoiler alert. Skip about how long you think right two minutes get about two minutes. Well, I mean, I'm an avid movie critic I'ma be honest, but what I go too in depth, it's all a roof people but  I'm just warning you. I mean, I think well, I've heard that the movie was all an illusion by the joking that it actually most of it didn't really happen. It was all in his head. I don't know a lot of people try to get really deep into it. Those people are honestly the worst just watch the movie, you know, right don't make us actually think you're like, yeah thought about it. Just watch the movie and make it imagine being a  To and you just like really Jamaica Plain movie and then people like overthinking you're like what they sometimes you just think like all the best directors actually just think like just make the simple move. Yes, and everyone else is overseeing some Jello just regular movie and we're all just interpreting our own ways. So it's deeper than that because we are have like our own self-importance kind of we don't enjoy  a pill already. That's that's creepy. You want to get into like the guidelines? I mean the basic guidelines for podcast. Well, we ran time what we're pro.  Sure, we're definitely pro-equality probably called. Yep anti anti racism that's bad anti-racism anti-sexism yo and tight. Well, we're probably quality. I guess we're anti all of that. But yeah, I guess we're good guys. Well,  I'm kind of for never mind. Not that listen. I just don't want this podcast come back about 10 years and keep me from getting a job. I don't think I don't think we're gonna have any controversial opinions. Honestly, we just think we like to joke about Allah. We like to just about probably we probably don't actually mean what we say most of the time. Yeah a lot of stuff we joke about probably shouldn't be joked about but I mean, that's the name of the pod.  You know, it's just a joke with I mean y-you really is it really is cheese mistake about who's on your wall Braden. That's your boy Clint Eastwood Clint Eastwood. Why do you think is he an inspirational character in your life? Whenever I think of a badass? Oh, okay. Well, yeah, that'd be the last bad ass out. Yeah, it's probably the last one now the Gods like he's okay. I'll get clammed anybody.  Thanks Clint Eastwood at us if he might have you're saying is movies. No in Gran Torino. The Asian kid could have faked blew his brains out at the end. He just like he meant for that to happen. It was a sappy movie. That's not what I'm looking for with Clint Eastwood. He's 90 years old. You should start making movies. I mean we have another guest in the building. It's name's Bo if I don't need to go into last night. Yeah.  ABO we recorded this earlier lost about 15 minutes worth of food. Yeah. We yeah, it was good. It's really groundbreaking stuff. Like we probably haven't had any good footage like that and you're never gonna hear it, but it was good just take our word for it is is probably the best conversation. I've had in a while, you know, I mean our mango Fizz podcasts just hmm, maybe just still stories in the weekend, you know, I mean, that's why we're dropping in on Mondays.  You just you take you get this. You got the whole week to prepare yourself for the weekend to do two things to learn from things that we did. Yeah, so you don't make the same mistake don't got a famous decks. That's that's the main point don't go to him. He's awful performer. He will get naked and kiss a girl underage women under age women. Well, probably not under a shade under age to drink. I guarantee age of consent guarantee. There were girls younger than the age of 17 given him given their brought to him.  Um, I don't that he was holding about 12 bras. I mean if we're just going off strictly age of what 17 you think there's 16 year olds there. I met a thirteen-year-old. No, you said hot? Yep, you're lying drinking a fifth of vodka. Swear. 13 years old. Mom was right there. Her mom was a smoke smoke. Yeah. Wow at a frat. You won't tell me how your weekend went Brett.

I'll tell you what you give you give much college students. You give a bunch of college students.  Sorry about that guys you bunch of college students weird Lots. They don't know how to act they really don't we tried the wave and I would think television cated students could perform a simple task is the wave. Okay, he did say in this everyone was holding up there. Everyone was holding up their flashlights. So you couldn't tell who's raising their hands. Everybody had their hands over their flashlights kind of pitiful excuse for the wave. Is that why would we even try I mean is I don't know he was so ready for  for it though. He went out there with the mic. He is like or Stat section. I'm going to start out with you. That was his big pitch for the week. Oh, yeah about that. He thought about that all week. No, I read a tweet. I read a tweet that it was a savings wife Miss Terry that wanted jeez it wanted to wave. I'm sorry I missed a will do better next time if that's what you want. If your plan was to get us to perform the wave-like perfectly. It's not gonna work because no one this is the first time that we need you little puke a few little beach balls. Why don't you first off start by telling us?  Where do you actually start? Hmm it probably to go red LEDs on the way be there. Yeah, it's a little dark can't really tell where the waves going. Nope. Everybody just staying. I'm sorry. I'm pretty uncomfortable right now. We got an audience member eating a whole pickle. That's kind of sucks not breaking apart. Just put the thing in his mouth and eating it hasn't even been into you really suspect. It's been five minutes. He's making out with a stache. That's just staring me right in my soul. Yep. Throw a snack.  - if anyone seen The metabee Lovely Bones where that girl gets murdered it's him. It's the do that murder and buried her in the ground that stashed exactly what you can picture just licking a pickle for the last five minutes has not been into you. This stash is just making me want to act up. Mmm grow a stache. If you are a male, you know grow a mustache, you know, you can go swimming. I'm more of a clean-shaven know it's time to get coming back.  What if I must if I don't have the capability to grow moustache?  I don't know what to tell you, but I don't know. Is that a problem? Yes, you think you can be a problem. Our female lead be able to grow a mustache eventually. I don't like clean shave her bush.  That's the same I'm talking about a Mustang but it knows your head I'm talking about in those Bush Bud cheese. We everyone is like Bush that reveals character. Shrimp knows bush.  It's that's what the ladies are looking for. Honestly. I think if not,  You really think that they like your mustache actually, I don't care if they like my moustache because I grow Moustache for myself. I like that.  Welcome back to episode bully bully years just told me we're going to call her. She's over there. Oh, I like go. You know I'm talking about. Yes. I like how our roommate just decides to invite a girl that I wouldn't say. It's a child say is it is important in Brock's life at this very good. Maybe maybe see what he's make effort for in this very moment.  Just invites her to our apartment while maybe mid first episode podcast, but we have priorities and he's not going to leave. No because this is important to us. Tell him we're chasing the bag and 2019. That's all we're doing. We're making this final push for 2020 get it back cats chasing the bag. Let's talk about that. No, let's talk about Pablo. He's short live life. Yeah our friend Brett decided to adopt a cat.  Okay, I didn't adopt the cat. Okay, he lost you told them we're gonna Foster to adopt so he was going to take the cat out their hands. He had to bring it back for shots. Apparently, no not telling us took it back four shots gives it back the next day. They put it down. No, that's not a line, but it does say that I'll be honest. I hated the cat. I didn't like it either anti-social.  No, benefit of us having we took two pictures with it. It was not worth it. Like I literally yelled in his face that I was gonna go eat some Chinese food get a little ancestors in my button my stomach if you have their ancestors, but the orange cats always tasted a little Panda the shell main with some orange cast an orange cat. Thank you Brett for contributing to the Chinese Border Town pow cat we're gonna head  go ahead this weekend. Just maybe Pablo be on the menu probably. I mean Panda Express probably as an already heavy on the minion in with the animal shelters around here by the gate that's wrong that is wrong. So basically the moral of the story is I did a good deed and client taking by I didn't cat's hope so no, OK don't you had a permanent home and then just crushing his dream.  Back into a cage. Imagine if you been if you just getting it if you're in the band is Oscar the cat. No, they didn't tidy me. It was in my room. If you're in an orphanage to people come to visit you all the kids. They like this. Yeah like you in the 76ers jersey you we want you they bring it home feed you for a week act like you're the best thing ever take you back to the  Orphanage leave you imagine now you can't was in a cage for four months before that guy. He gives Look Away there's often. Do you honestly think that a cat?  And human are the same.  So it's okay to kill a cat. No, I just said I said be look away. That's literally what Brett just said. It's okay to kill cat. No, I'm sorry about that guys. Listen, I love how they dispute my word. No imagine though. How do you how would you expect that? If you were in a cage for four months, would you just be loving on people all of a sudden? I mean, you know, he like shakes the warm-up Beyond cat is a small creature.  To that cat it was pretty big room.  You know what had food give it to know what keeping a cat for a week and then letting it die may not change the world. But for that cat you basically add the world would change eggs the cat you didn't you made him to collect permanent and cats. He wanted to get to get lunches and you just so mad at guys. Somebody's knocking on the door mid. Don't don't pause. It will just keep going. It's okay. It's episode 1 brother.  Episode 1 is frustrating. We live in your lungs. Yeah, we live in where you live.

If you're tired, you don't have to worry about being shy have y'all seen those things on Shark Tank. It's the stools you put in from the toilet. Oh, yeah, they were you know, they work there Daniel Tosh one time. Okay, speaking of poops is taking a weird tone Daniel Tosh one time pitched ideas, like a 10-foot pooper. It's like a big long tube you jump on a trampoline you get up.  You poop but like could you know every time you boot most time you poop a little splash? It's on you. See lately. I used to think that but lately I've been as Mu clogs just pooping and then I get up go to walk off done wiping got a pig in gotta go to the store. Now people think I'm a weirdo goes in the stall and then comes out and goes to the urinals. What kind of psycho D. People think I'm a cunt you a little they owe me one.  You're so high up that the water can't Splash up and get on your butt. Yeah, because you know, that's the worst like you ever just took away and it just it rocked up and just like okay, man.  But you can't do it either.  Steamiest dumps. No, I promise you that I met at any one time they could knock you down with her feces Jesus like absolutely.  You're not that's what scares me. I feel like the whole supermodels just poop all their fat out there. Is that because they have to there's no way you mean that there's two loads of cult getting rid of all the Poo. It's Coke make you poop. We got it. Yes. Okay. Oh, yeah. It's my bed is our research. That was our sample. Its have confirmed code makes you poop. So that's a Coca-Cola.  Adderall and Bob Vance make you poop. I don't know. I don't talk about how there's a direct correlation with successful people in cocaine usage. I mean, oh it's a direct correlation, but there's probably correlation. You rarely see a rich successful businessman that's not as doesn't have a raging addiction to coat the coat when you get money, you can afford Coke. So then I get that it is a rich girl. I mean this girl her dad.  Some Wall Street. Oh, yeah, Taz it out. That's four. That's the only time I've ever seen Coke in my life. I've looks just like sugar just like oh no I said Dale show because you never know. Well, I don't smell just selling bag of sugar somebody. Yeah, like why is that not a thing? Well, you can see in the Shameless when they put the baby power or baby laxatives in it.  Baby likes it. Yo reply snap. Oh not really a snap reply to the pod in the comments what I should be feeling. Shy be Fogle I'll supervise.  You know McLovin or I mean I'm a pretty nerdy looking do with black hair. So that fits pretty well am slow. Should I be dead sick as well as how we like to describe my blue super thick man like yeah James Charles thick but still has the qualities of a slim tall man. You know, I'm not why you got such a little big booty. That is absolutely insane.  That a man can carry that Caboose. Well, I like the wagon on the yeah, you're like such a little dude when I saw that picture on Twitter immediately clear Charlie and I was like, oh my gosh, I did not know that was passed. I thought summary on the old. Yes. I was what Instagram model is at Coachella right now because it look pretty good. I'm not gonna lie Hooper little fat little pooper. Yeah it is it is nice. I'm I'll compliment him on it.  I'm not going to like talk to more like ever speak to him, but he's got a nice caboose on him. Let's be real and that's if you're straight gay whatever. Everybody knows you see a half cut out of that picture speaking of gay. I'm talking about old. Let's call him Landing. Okay. Okay, my friends from home came through this weekend shout out Landon not going to say last names because I want  Only by his identity, but he's worried about three or four women and some of them were some one would question his sexuality a little bit a little bit. They were may put it on himself. So he brought it up, but he's getting bother but he really is down and it makes you really wonder who makes you really wonder. What's really bothering. I've been that man for  15 years at least never made a move on me, but last night I'm starting to second-guess. Yes. He was very adamant. And when he hears this, he's not going to be happy. He's not gonna doubt. He's listening to 35 minutes in or whatever. Yeah. Yeah. He probably cut off about 30 seconds until takes me like, oh, it's pretty good episode man. You did great. I'll ask him. One thing that was on it. He won't be able to tell me. Yeah, it seems like he dropped.  Is whole Cigar Case glass Cigar Case on the road and three two of the two of the four girls were Barefoot that we were with and he just threw glass on the ground. They were Barefoot. They were Barefoot. Don't ask me why they were Barefoot. I thought was a grimy move. I'ma be honest, but you're walking on the road. They were I had shoes on they had socks on for some reason I shouldn't wear the boots.  Don't as get ringworm and I didn't say it when the ground move that didn't come mouth. I'm just saying if you see somebody Barefoot, you got to have Kenny Stowe glass on them. Yeah, that's tough. But I mean he had a good time. At least he got to go an all-girls dorm. He definitely had a not against anyone's will perfectly okay for him to be there.  Let's describe that how was it bro? It was Heaven. It was all anybody ever wants to invite me in there again on a game day where it's right after game day. You gotta get that parent and girl combo. It's just double mmm. So during the week might not be anybody there she on game that you got friends. You got aunts. You got cousins you got sisters the answer the way to go you got Grandma answer looking to get a little while.  I'll tell you what a little Grandma actually grandma mom and daughter. Yeah, those videos are good. You know, you never think about that just like what if I feel like it would be probably cause some disruption in the family less. This is how we would I'll tell you later. This French giving would be it would be odd when you show up you say pass the cranberry sauce baby and they all reach for it. It's kind of its would be kind of weird. Most don't know water on me.  If I haven't addressed this might be my first and only podcast I've actually surprised I made it 40 minutes because my whole left arm is going on. So either what do you think a heart attack stroke? I think that's the signs of a heart attack. Okay whole left arms going numb been on for about an hour. So this might be the last like if you're hearing this this might be the last time I speak first time and my face could be put in a museum or something. Yeah.  The first five this Salon Museum, there's about eight more. There's about eight smithsonian's I can find somewhere to put this one in right? Yeah. I have they got smithsonian's for the dumbest stuff. They do don't even get me started well bones in there and stuff like that like, yeah, I mean, it's good eating for some - and don't even get me started on Washington, Iowa put it in a state, you know. Yeah, I thought Washington DC I didn't know what say that was and you could ask me as  Till I met someone from there I had no idea what makes them think they're good enough to not even be in a state. You know, right? I think it's so that's the nation's capital can be unbiased. Well, we're gonna go when you're really asking more dancer. Yeah Toto we just wanted to go with it. They were stuck up anybody at listen. This isn't actually looking for knowledge, right? No they're looking for I don't know what they're looking for is I don't know what chips are 41 minutes here.  Let me tell you wasted a large part of your day. Yeah, but you've been productive and been working out or doing your homework or something like that. You have wasted 40 minutes on people that are very  Unqualified I'm calling to tell you about anything we didn't even know how many oceans there were just gonna say that was the Southern Ocean was it. I wonder if they are ever gonna Ram it in the definitely. I'm Street Smart. So let me tell you let me tell you.  How much I can't get into bed?  So what do you think that girl is doing? Probably just sitting waiting on me. Honestly, she'll go home. You visual. Text me. Yeah, I mean she really had this no transplant for a week. Yeah. Hey and this paper we go was to start. Let's say ten o'clock is 12:28 in the morning what happens?  Monday morning though for sure start your last week.  Meet of I can't take this man's here's our whole audience is left. So again if you're still listening  I think we should close right there. He's English. This is open 43 minutes and it's not bad. It's the first one. I mean, I mean Set It Off Les you got anything else. You need to get off your chest. I mean I can say it for the next one, I guess. So, I mean well if you want to hear some more of us ramble on about stuff, we don't really know about a plug your Instagram Twitter and Instagram. It's G underscore Donald underscore and then I believe my  Is let's find it. You want to go into your Snapchat neighbors? I'm not gonna go into Snapchat name. It was made pretty early on like early in the Snapchat days before when you could see anybody. But what do you got believer that back when you could see who's best friends with his which was a trap a trap. I forgot. I wow wasn't true. I would be you had to watch it.  You're like if you're sad chapter 2 says gotta all right there. You were sad tend to suspect girl. All the boys are fine. Then knowing their knowing what you doing. My leg. All they got to do is click on your name three best friends right there. It's a tough scene. Imagine that 2014. It was a tough say goodness. Imagine thank God Snapchat wised up went to friend emojis and not revealing your best friends so you can send chat mode threes and  He's no friend of Marge's will get you caught two friend emojis, but you gotta watch those good be loading up on you. Sometimes like you look at in the next morning. Like we're both are number one and then they're like, there's no no like you'd be with a girl and you be with you be snapping her best friend of so their number one, right? But then your number ones with that other best friend that says you got the same best friend and now you caught caught maybe they're into that though. Maybe they are but it's highly unlikely, but what if  If you know, yeah, I don't think I can live through life not chasing that would if you know, you don't know more of the story Snapchat best friends. It'll work out on him break them up. Yeah break them up. It divided house about is always the best. Hmm. I'm pretty sure that was quote A House Divided will stand. Yeah from what is that the Bible I thought it was a that Corinthians Bama football. Oh Bama football football.  connected  Really? That's what he's doing. I don't think so. We shouldn't we don't really know anything about that. That's one thing. We're not even getting politics. We're not well versed in the any of those areas. So we probably need me shouldn't talk about it seems as though it only causes arguments. All right. Listen this bad boy. All right rageous reach out on social media. Let us know what you want to talk about. Let us know what you want to hear any criticism.  Is there anything you would like to hear? I mean, we'd love to hear it fire criticism. I'll probably tell you to go kick rocks. I probably tell you kid cracks, but I will change it. I believe it if you call it out. I'll focus on it. So we also doing call ins maybe I have some y'all want.  Maybe the only funny if you call in and some dumb stuff like a serious like don't ask us about serious things. We're not going to talk about it because they don't like we just don't have anything serious to say honest the serious stuff isn't interesting to me not so I only listened to wow many go through what I go through life.

Thank you for joining me this week. I'm super excited as always about this episode. Have you ever felt like that's it. I quit I give up. This is stupid. My business hates me. I don't even know why I'm doing this. If you've ever felt that way, then you definitely want to stay tuned for this weeks episode. If you haven't felt that way yet. Maybe you are new or in the business then.  Maybe it's a good thing to listen to anyways, I have had the craziest week this week. It has been nuts my fiance just had surgery last week. Everything went very well. It was great. So that's good because off of work for about a month or so, so we are not driving each other crazy yet. So it's been a full week. So I'm very blessed about that. But anyways, so, yeah, just been working from home. He's been home trying to help him and make sure everything's good to go school.  Starts tomorrow so school supplies orientation all that fun stuff. You know what I'm talking about? Hmm, super fun, right anyways. So today we are going to talk about nine different things that you can do when you feel like you want to quit like what the hell why am I doing this? This sucks? My business hates me all that fun stuff, right? So let's go ahead and just dive on in the first thing that I think of that  That when I think of this phrase in the past seven years my business like I quit I give up I just don't want to do this anymore. Right is burnout. That's the first thing I think of because when I think about those times that I've been to that point my business where I'm just like I didn't want to do this anymore. Am I even make it an impact? Why am I doing this? I'm you know, my clients are canceling left and right blah blah blah. The first thing that I think about is burnout because let's get totally real burnout is real.  And it happens and it's okay the that happens you have to expect struggle with changes and it's something that not necessarily you see a lot of other entrepreneurs kind of talk about really like freely online like hi. I'm burnout. I don't like my business today or whatever it would be but I have recently been in this situation where I'm like I quit I give up and I was telling my fiance the other day I said, I'm just  Mad at my business like I'm mad at it right now. Like I don't want to look at it. I don't talk to it. I'm done with it. Right I felt like freaking given up. And the first thing that I've learned is to start to look internally on what's going on. Like why am I what's going on with my business? Why is my business not producing the things that I need it to produce for me right now and I go back to a lot of different things that I've learned and it all  It's internally so it doesn't mean when you hit a burnout. It doesn't mean you got to throw in the towel. It doesn't mean something's wrong. It doesn't mean that the business doesn't work. It doesn't mean that you shouldn't be doing this. Okay, let me ruffle some feathers real quick. If you are within one year of your business and you're feeling a burn out. I could understand that. I think that you know, some women hustle their ass off some women hustle hard and potentially. Yeah, you could be in a burnout, but if you are less than 12 months into your business,  And you're trying to throw in the towel or you think it's not for you or your like I've tried and it's just not working. Hush your face, hush your face girlfriend because you have not tried at all in the amount of time that it takes to build a clientele and a business. Okay. I'm sorry. If that doesn't make you happy then I am sorry, but it's the truth. I have seen women come into Industries and or start a business for themselves, and they've  Tried for less than a year and they give up and guess what? It never works. I've seen women hit fail after fail after roadblock after roadblock the entire first year to in their business and they've turned around and they've made their business into a six-figure business. Okay, so you can't expect to be an overnight success. All right. So let's get back to what we were talking about. So it doesn't mean throw in the towel. And if you're recognizing a burnout in your business, that's okay. Okay, just  You're not the only person that has been there. Okay, every single person every single woman has started at zero and that's the most beautiful thing about this is every person that has started their own business starts at zero. Nobody comes into this with 4,000 customers, right? So my first tip, I'm going to give you guys a nine things to talk earlier maybe to write down or think about you can actually come back to this episode. Go ahead and pause it. If you want to grab a pen and paper real quick. We're gonna talk about nine things that I have personally done.  Done to help myself. Get out of this. I'm going to quit attitude, right? So number one is take a day or two. My girls know if they're feeling overwhelmed if they're feeling anxious if they are just mad at their business like if they're fighting with their business currently. The first thing I'm going to say to them is take a day take a day put your business down. Don't think about it. Don't touch it. Don't talk about it. Just take a day because you need to rebuild this goes back to our first episode you need to rebuild.  Yourself, you need to fill up your own cup. So take a day. Take two days take an entire weekend. If you need to if you are feeling anxious and overwhelmed diving even more into your business when you're mad at it. It's not going to help you. So take a day or two number two. What is working? What is not so I want you to get really honest with yourself and this is really difficult for a lot of people and I want you to take a look and see what you are actually doing.  Uh doing how are you how you are doing income-producing activities? So are you just scrolling on Facebook randomly posting things hoping for someone to get back with you to invest in you maybe take one of your horses or maybe by one of your products or are you actually taking the time and connecting one on one with people that are your customers or your potential customers and actually creating an engaging?  With them. Which one are you doing? Are you passive or are you actually creating relationships?  Getting honest with ourselves about our businesses probably the most difficult thing because we have to accept that what we're doing isn't working but not only that we have to look past that and we have to say Okay, what I'm doing isn't working now, so how can I shift my energy and instead of saying well this isn't working it's not working, but that's great because guess what now, you know, what doesn't work. So stop doing that turn your energy around shift that shit and figure out something that is going to work for you.  This work for me is just creating honest wholesome relationships with my customers. So what's not working? And what is working if you haven't figured out what is working yet Reach Out get your butt out there. Try something different try something new. It can be so beneficial for you just to shift your energy from doing one thing to doing a different thing. Right? So the next thing number three is start evaluating your thoughts.  How are you talking to yourself? How are you? Kind of interacting with your business. Are you mad at your business? Are you thinking like, well this shit ain't even working. I don't know why I'm doing it. Why am I even putting time into a why am I doing this? Why am I doing that if that's the energy you have? I'm just going to get blatantly honest with you guys right now. You're not going to have a great response from anyone. If you have a robot attitude, you're always negative. You don't have a clear message if you are constantly putting all of your products on.  Y'all yada yada yada, whatever if you're doing all of that, you're not going to create the best wholesome relationships with your potential customers and clients that you need to have. Right? So people need to realize that you are beneficial for them. They are buying from you because you're you they're not buying your product or this or that or whatever they're buying from you because they trust you and they like you so make sure you are actually likeable, right? What kind of energy are you putting out into the universe?  What kind of energy are you putting into your business and yourself as well? Take a definite look at that and really ask yourself and get super honest. If you have a negative mindset currently and what you can do to shift that another thing number four is take a look at your success so far. What have you accomplished? Have you earned a trip? Have you created, you know multiple courses online that you are super proud of have you invited somebody too.  You know to listen to your podcast and all of a sudden it has over 200 plays like think about what you've accomplished so far and what you're excited about and reward yourself for that. The next one is get really fucking clear about your why why did you start this business? Why did you want to go into business for yourself? Why do you want to be here? And what sets you apart? Right? So what is it? Is it your kid?  Kids is it because you hated your 9 to 5 you believed in something with your entire heart get really fucking clear about your why why did you start this? If you ever get to this point that's an awesome thing to do is just think about why you started this. Did you want the freedom? Did you need the money? Do you want the recognition? Do you want to work with other like-minded entrepreneurs like yourself? Why did you get into this business? Why did you start your own?  I love this next one and it's making a clear decision. So I meet a lot of women who are half in half out with their business. It's their side hustle yata, whatever I get it. Okay, a lot of you guys probably have previously had or still have full-time jobs, and I get that and there's only so much time in a day and I get that too, but we need to talk real quick about making a clear decision.  Making a clear decision. You have to dedicate yourself dedicate yourself and say yes, this is what I'm doing. This is why I'm doing it. This is where I'm going with it. And you girlfriend do not take no for an answer. Okay, if somebody tells, you know be like cool awesome move that van. Don't worry about it. Do not take know personally. Okay, you cannot take know personally move on to the next one because I guarantee you there is a thousand other women for every single know that would love.  Of what you offer, they would love to have what you offer. Okay. So make a clear decision. Are you in or are you out are you going to dedicate time to fulfill your dreams and everything that you wanted when you first started this industry in this business, whatever it may be what got you excited and go back to that. Don't let that girl down. Okay, stop looking at things as problems and start saying opportunities. I love this. So again kind of  When we went back, we kind of going off of one of the previous, you know tips that we had talked about is looking at things as problems and start seeing opportunities. So get your mindset, right? Okay. It's like oh this doesn't work. Then I'm Above the Law whatever you get all flustered and you get all pissed off because something didn't work and yada yada yada. I am fucking grateful that something didn't work in my business because I know damn well, I ain't going to do that again. Okay, so that's getting me closer to the things and getting me more.  Clear about the things that I can do in my business just shifting my energy not even doing extra work, but it's just shifting my energy and putting the energy into something else that is going to work. Does that make sense? So everything that you have is an opportunity, I'll tell you guys some of you guys know what I do for a living and some of you don't so here's a quick little thing. I went to a party one time and there was like three women there and I'm like, oh great because normally have like 10 20 people there and this was years ago, and I'm like, okay great.  Okay, maybe we're not gonna have huge sales. Whatever. Maybe I can get one of these girls to you know, join the company or maybe book a party or something like that. Right? So I always always always go and I don't care if there's 400 women there or for women there. Okay always go in and I'm like this is gonna be awesome because I can give me this many new women and this many lives I can change today in one way or another right? So I go in there's like four women there. I driven like a half an hour, right? Nobody wanted a book a party. Nobody wanted to join which okay, that's fine. I was probably  about 3 to 4 years into my business at this point. I was making about three to four thousand dollars a month and it was great and I was like, yeah, this is awesome. Whatever right super high on my business. I was loving it. So by the end of the party whatever I didn't think that these girls would be Big Spenders, but by the end of the party every single person ordered almost three to four hundred dollars worth of product and I was like damn girl. Okay, so it totally shocked me I had no idea I was thinking like, oh my God, this is gonna find suck like nobody's gonna buy anything every single person there.  All for those girls ended up being like a $1,600 party because she had a couple outside orders to and I was like heck to the yes, so I went into it with a good attitude. If I went into that with a bad attitude, they can pick up on my vibes. They're going to be able to tell like this girl's not excited to be here. She's just trying to rush through blah blah blah and they could pick up on that. So I kicked that party's ass and it rewarded me for it. Okay and same sort of thing. Let's flip flop that.  Can go into room 20 some women in cell three hundred dollars worth of stuff. Right? So it's kind of on me. It's my job and my responsibility to show up as the best fucking version of me and literally give these people the best experience that they've ever had. Right? So the next thing I want to talk to you guys, there's two more things. So number eight is being thankful being thankful. Just at the end of the day if you guys listen to the previous episodes, you know that I love my journal my brain.  Dump the end of the day right three things you're thankful for. Okay, even if it's in a note section, even if it's on your calendar and your phone, if you're you know, waiting at a red light or whatever just take the couple minutes and write down three things every single day that you're thankful for. I promise it will help change your mindset and the last but not least is ask for help. There are women if you are in multi-level marketing direct sales you network marketing if you have your own business, it does not matter.  You can find someone to Mentor you who you look up to and someone who is going to be a positive impact in your life. I don't even care if they're in the same industry or not. I don't care. It doesn't matter find someone that you look up to that inspires you that really fuels your fire. Every time you see their shit online or talk to him or whatever be like God this person is fucking awesome. Let me reach out to her and just tell her what I'm struggling with or him. It doesn't matter get one-on-one and sometimes maybe these people may not know you  you may not have a personal relationship with them. But I guarantee you you have a group of people who can help you whether it be in, you know online groups or maybe in your business industry or maybe someone that you have coached with or maybe you know, something like that find a mentor and ask for help. If you are not asking for help and you are a little bit unaware on what to do how to take the next step ask for help. I am always here. I don't know how many women die.  We intend this is the entire reason why I started this podcast is because I have women from multiple different companies coming to me. How do you do this? How do you do that? I I'm experiencing this my business. How do you get over that? You know things like that and I'm like girl. I don't even know I just saw sex. I was okay, but this is the reason why I started this podcast is because there's women that are my age in the same sort of industries that need help with these things and I cannot give a pat on the back to their upline because  If your person is reaching out to you and you're ignoring them shame on you, if you were a person who is in a business like mine or industry where you have a sponsor you have an upline things like that and you're not reaching out to them for help shame on you as well. You have to ask for help. We are in this industry together. No one no one is going to turn you down at least in my company. No one is going to turn their head. No one is going to shy away from you. That's  We do we are here to help so you're not alone. Okay, I'm going to wrap this up with this You are not alone. You have so many people that care about you and your business and I guarantee you you are not the first person to experience this. You're not the first person to say Fuck this I'm out right at all because girlfriend I've been there. I've quit my business like 48 times. All right, I'm not even gonna lie to you. I remember walking downstairs just bawling like I quit that's it. I'm done.  April really sucks for me and I really don't want to put this out in the universe but I'm just being completely transparent with y'all. April sucks for me. It's my birthday month. I don't know if I just don't give a shit, but I have no great luck in April. It's not the greatest month for me when it comes to business and that's okay. I recognize it. I move forward and I change things every single year to try to set myself up for success, but I have had five parties cancel in one weekend. I have had people quit on me. I have had so many.  Things happen that have shifted my mindset and I'm like, okay if this I'm out, I'm quit. I quit. I'm done. I don't want to do this anymore. Right? I take a few days. I have done all of these steps and I come back to my business with a fresh brain a fresh mind and a fresh Outlook. So take a little bit of these write them down, right the ones down that you're willing to do and the next time that you feel this way take a look at this.  This list and try a few of these things.

And so I just would like to jump right into why I'm here and what this podcast is going to be all about and give you guys just a little tidbit of information about myself this name what you can potentially learn from listening to a podcast like this how this is gonna evaluate you bring you Joy.  Tune out your mind whatever the reason that you're coming here. Maybe just giving you a little snippet of the Y on why I'm here, so.  Coming home. This podcast has been something that's been sitting in the back of my mind for probably about a year and a half which is a little crazy. There were definitely a lot of  fear-based thoughts limiting beliefs  Things I was just telling myself that were complete shit stories that were not true. I'm not giving me any.  Value we're not helping me birth this into existence. And so finally I decided it's time it's time to take the plunge time to do it. It's time to open up and give people a deeper look inside of my life inside of what this journey has felt like to me and my experience and some tools that I can offer to you guys.  Other be through myself or guess who I bring on the show, which eventually I would like to have some healers acupuncturists astrologers life coaches nutritionists yoga instructors. I want to offer a really broad holistic approach to the ways that we come home to ourselves and the way that we return to our body and return to  To our inner child and the way this is that we forget who we are deep down because of social conditioning or life traumas or whatever the story maybe that you're experiencing right now that's causing you to forget deep down who you really are. So my hope and dream of this podcast is to just dive deeper into those.  not so talked about areas talk about the ways in which we heal and all the plant medicines and the ways we can connect back with Mother Earth and things that have brought me a sense of relief in this journey and a sense of great return to myself and to this little inner girl who has this always been here, but  Then like hiding in the corner. I want to say she's just been afraid to come back after a lot of pain and a lot of hardships and all the ways in which we can use these tools and these guidance systems to return to ourselves. So, however, you found me here whether you know me through  Through real life or you know me through social media or you just stumbled upon this in your recent searches. I just want to say a little bit about who I am what my journey has been what brought me here and how we're going to journey and walk through this life together and use these tools and resources to guide each other back into this sweet Divine place of  Existence and so a funny story about myself. My name is Alyssa the other day. Someone had asked me to sign a paper at the bottom.  Where they had EXT and I picked up the pen and totally forgot my name and who I was and completely blanked on who I am in this body. It was a really odd thing to happen. And I think I'm always caught up in this really.  Tricky situation of who am I? What? What is this? What is this body? Who are we so I can give you really superficial things about myself I can tell you that. I am a Capricorn son. My rising sign is Virgo and my moon is in Aquarius. And for those of you who know things out astrology awesome. And for those who don't  Let's just talk about what that means what and what that means to me because I'm constantly diving into astrology with other people and I love love astrology as one of the tools to use to come back to ourselves. It's such a Divine blueprint of who we are it is so precise and so perfect and it's being and honestly quite comical the same time. So my Cabaret  Born I've been told is like this Wild Horse just running. I feel really driven and motivated and this really hard worker and just really going for it all the time. I think my Capricorn energy is very grounded when I'm out of balance. I noticed that energy is no longer grounded but in its natural form.  For my think the capricornia me really appreciates the Earth and connects really deeply with the Earth. And as far as my rising sign in Virgo, I like to think that's my OCD brain where I like everything really orderly and very color-coordinated and time organized and type A and it could be a little  To myself, but I greatly enjoy that in this lifetime. I'm working to be more of my Virgo self because I've already mastered this Capricorn energy of working hard and achieving and being driven for Success. So Virgos also ruled by the Earth. So I have this really earthy energy, but my subconscious brain is an aquarius, so I tend to one  Under a lot and I tend to wander a lot and that looks a little bit different depending on where I'm at in life. But lately I've been doing a lot of wandering. I live in Portland, Oregon. There is so many beautiful beautiful things to explore and do and see and experience out here. So the Aquarian in my brain is constantly scheming up things and daydreaming  And just you know picturing myself in this flower of fields that I can just Drift Away into and I think all of these three elements really bring a really great balance into my life and it is a blueprint for who I am but I don't necessarily want to say that's the end-all-be-all is your astrological chart. I think there's always these layers of ourselves that were unfolding and Diving deeper.  Were into and it may be represented in your chart if you go further into astrology and learn more and look at it on a regular year basis of where the planets at this year. What am I going to learn from the planets? How is this year going to be dictated by the solar system and by this universe that is so far.  Moved from our physical bodies, but also so heavily influenced on are physically physical bodies. So I think that's such an amazing gift and resource if you have not looked into astrology. I recommend finding the astrologer getting a reading done. They're very inexpensive. There are soliders everywhere find someone who can give you a deeper insight.  And to who you are as a person and in so many ways you're going to remember and see things that you have totally forgotten about yourself. So that's one component of who I am as a person. I think that's really superficial. I think it's very complex beyond that another great amazing tool that I've worked a little bit with is my human.  Fine. So for anyone who knows about human design, my design is a projector and I make up 20% of the population is designed as projectors. And for me, that was a really rude awakening when I understood about my energy and how my energy interacts in the world around me and how  I've just not been using my energy correctly to the best of my abilities. So for a projector is it's important because we're always absorbing and taking in and receiving energy because we're not creating it ourselves. So there has been a deep need for me to rest and reset and spend time alone that I never really honored in myself and never really gave myself.  I definitely am an over extender. I'm a helper I want to offer myself to everyone in such a way to be of service. I love I love that about myself and also that is really detrimental to my energetic body and how it wants to interact in the world. So learning about human design. I had such deep Awakenings, too.  Two things I needed to do for myself that were so vital to my existence that I was completely neglecting. So when I learned, you know through online resources through reading through my own personal experimentation. I found so much or so many blind spots to my energetic body and I'm still discovering all those blind spots and how they  This and how they manifest into my life and it was a really hard thing for me to go through and learn about because I I would say that I was living almost completely out of alignment with being a projector. I was trying to keep up with the generators of the world and being in close proximity to generators. I want to keep up with those people and I want to you know, reflect back their energy and  Until I realized that I was totally draining myself so astrology human design.  You can look at your Enneagram number mines number two, which is the helper. These are all just deeper ways to understand ourselves in different vocabulary. I want to say we know this information. It's in us we are so aware and unaware of who we are when we are.  Sitting in this time and space. So for me all these things have just been great tools great reminders great resources for me to come home and look at myself and see through these different perspectives and different lenses of like, who am I? What am I doing? Where am I going? What do I need? What don't I need what's not serving me. So if you haven't looked into any of these things, I'm just going to leave some  Really simple things in the show notes about human design astrology the things that I use some of my favorite books and ultimately I want this podcast to be that for you. I want this to be a resource of figuring yourself out figuring out where am I not living in alignment? Where is my  Energy being thrown off. How can I create this really peaceful internal and external world of love? Peace. Joy and excitement and that's really like sets my freaking soul on fire when I'm recording things like this is to somehow if you just get a little snippet of information from something I say,  that to me is everything and so much more than I can ever ask for so I just would love your guys suggestions on what you want to hear how you want to interact in this space who you think would be an amazing asset to this podcast and some stories that I'm just really excited to share with you guys that I've never talked about in the on  online space things that I've kept really personal I want this to be that platform of opening up and sharing a piece of my heart and a piece of my soul and being just really authentic and real with you guys about who I am how I've evolved on this journey how we are evolving together how we're going to lift each other up. I think it's going to be and I know that it's going to be so so beautiful.  And I'm just so excited to have you here and soon I'll be releasing my first real episode which I'm super excited about. So for everyone that listened, I love you. I'm sending you all of the blessings in the world and I greatly hope that you return here and return to yourself.  And of course if you enjoyed just this little brief episode, I would love if you can share on social media and give me a tag. You can find me pretty much always on Instagram at Alyssa period Donato and I look forward to hearing from all of you and sharing more and opening up this space and just know that you are so deeply loved and cared for  on this journey.

I texted my friend the other day. I said, I want you to make this confession over your life. I want you to look at everything that seems stupid that you're doing right now the feels like there's I know moms feel like this. I know you do. I know that I know that employees and jobs and you don't really like feel like this. I know couples trying to get out of that feel like this. I know people that are believing God to bless them in a bigger way, and you know, you're in a small space. I know you  This West I want to make this confession over your life. I said I want you to say this is significant.  This is significant. This is significant running a vacuum cleaner. This is significant changing a diaper. This is significant coming home. Just being a good husband. This is significant. This is significant the devil won't like it when you say that because the way he gets you to leave your assignment is to convince you that it doesn't matter what you're working on.  It's so small.  so small, this is  significant and don't wait to say that until it seems significant because that takes no faith. This is significant this this this not just that this is significant. Have you ever wanted a new car and you picked out the kind of car you wanted and the next thing you knew you started seeing that car everywhere. You went what happened? They just flooded the market with  Car all of a sudden Google has an algorithm in your brain. And so they put the cars in front of you perhaps we're probably coming to that day, but it went to Amazon baby. It was your attention. You started seeing it.  When you started searching for it.  You want to like that matters make it matter.  Make it matter make it matter. This is significant. It's a cloud the size of a man's hand and alleges that let's go. That's what we've been waiting for. It sucks. But it's a start it's small but it's a start I barely see it, but it's a start. We got a long way to go because we got in this famine three and a half years ago, and it's not going to be over overnight, but it's a start.  It's a star and my start is significant. Can I show you one more thing? Can I if you need to leave go ahead and leave but I'm gonna take 10 minutes with everybody who wants to hear because if the enemy cannot get you to stay listen.  He wants and I don't know if you believe in the devil, but you're brainless. Let's approach it from a psychological perspective. If you don't believe in the devil, you don't have kids but just in case you don't have kids and don't believe your brain is wired for survival. Okay, so when you're living in your head, all you're thinking about is survival.  What has Elijah been doing for three and a half years before the drought was over?  survival which in that three and a half year span was success because sometimes just making it is what matters just making it is what matters I mean just still being in faith is Victory sometimes but when the shift happens  I wonder will you be ready for the rain you've been praying for because your brain if you stay inside your brain, your reflex will always be to run. What is Elijah been doing for the last three and a half years. What Come on talk to me Church. What's he even doing? He's been running surviving and running and surviving and running and surviving. So in the rain comes he runs and for a little while, he's running ahead of the rain. He's running in front of the Chariot because he's ready for his next.  Simon is ready to serve Ahab. Now, he believes Revival has come to the nation. The bill profits have been destroyed. The answer of profits are laying at their own Alters dead in their own blood and now revival can come and so he runs 17 miles on the fuel of his faith on the fuel of the promise of God coming to pass in his life. He runs ahead of the Chariot. He runs ahead of the rain and then something happens because if the enemy can't kill you in the  Is ability stage?  for the insignificant stage  The only thing left for him to do to keep you from receiving what God is pouring out in your life is intimidation.  He can't keep God for making it rain.  But maybe he can keep you from receiving it. You can get your run.  Because I'm a runner. I'm a refugee and I'm a Rainmaker.  But now I'm a refugee. What what what what what happens watch what happens when when Elijah should be celebrating the storm. I'll come back to that another week celebrate your storm celebrate your storm. We always preach about storms like a something we want to get out of what if the storm that God sent into your life was to prove his presence celebrate your storm celebrate your storm celebrate your storm celebrate.  The storms just survive and celebrate the storms when they come because you know God is with you in the storm. He is an ever-present help in the time of trouble.  And when the storm came and they have went down and told Jezebel what Elijah had done she knew that her days were number so she sends a messenger to Elijah and what happens next is going to shock you because you just watched the faith of a Rainmaker.  And now you're going to see the fear of a renegade or runaway a refugee.  And The Messengers come to Elijah. Come on. Let's play this out and they say Jezebel says she's gonna kill you.  What we expect the scripture off the screen what we are expecting next is for Elijah to tell Jezebel where she can go with that noise and what she can do with her threats. Come on. What are you  wish Jezebel would try to kill me.  So what comes next to shocking against the backdrop of the boldness of a profit? I'll put his head between his knees and waited for Ray.  Oh survived, three and a half years of drought was fed by the mouths of birds and at the house of a widow and now the rain has come and how the drought is over. And now first three Elijah was afraid never thought I'd see those three words.  Never thought he would I mean I would have understood if he ran one of the drought.  Was still in progress, but it's raining now. It's raining and Elijah the one who survived three and a half years of drought.  Is running the Bible says he's running.  for his life  I don't buy it. I'm sorry. I don't buy it.  I don't believe Elijah that you're afraid that Jezebel can kill you because if she could have killed you. She wouldn't have sent Messengers to warn you if she could kill you. She was Center bailiffs to arrest you, but she knows she can't kill you. So she's trying to contain you.  Don't you know the devil found out a long time ago that he can't curse what God has blessed don't you know, the temple could have killed you by now, he would have killed you by now if he could have kept it from raining. He would have kept it from raining if he could have taken you out you'd be out.  Assessing couldn't kill you and tries to contain you so he intimidates you and now Elijah is running. Please catch this he is running from the same rain that he prayed for some of us are better at surviving in famine than we are at living in blessing.  What I mean what what I mean is when the rain started the one who ran ahead of the rain started running away from the rain.  So the message God gave me for somebody today. You know who you are is that you are running from the rain you are running from the blessing of God, you are running from something that has already defeated you are running from shame that the cross of Jesus Christ has already taken away. You are running from a pal.  Of sin that has already been broken you are running from situations that God has already worked out to our running from an outcome that you don't have to fear. Just what God's going to deal with Jessabelle and back in the right direction and run towards the rain. It's raining now, the trout is Topher come out of the trout. It's raining now.  Why won't you run from the rain? Why would you run from the blessing of God see when you run from the resistance you run from the rain?  When you run from the battle you run from the blessings when you run from the problem you run from the promise when you run from the problem you run from the Harvest. Why you running from  You really believe that Jezebel can kill you after all you've already survived you really think Jezebel has the power in her mouth to stop what God is doing in your life. No, somebody shout. I'm coming out of the drought. I'm coming out of the trout up in try too long to feed it to all depressed too long discourage too long. It's a new season in my life.

spotify:episode:4pFeNbcfOpcjHdj6qV5inM	This is the FM go channel of all India radio in the program news analysis. Now, we bring you a discussion on you have to end sanctions exemptions on Iran oil imports. The participants are take a bhattacharya economic analyst and when a pond a journalist in November last year, the United States had announced sanctions on Iran asking countries to stop importing oil from the country in a bid to put pressure on the Three two roll back its nuclear program at that time. It had given a six-month we were to some of the big importers of Iranian oil like India turkey South Korea and China also and that we were was to expire on me too. There was expectation that this would be extended with a lower amount of imports, but that has not happened and we are going to have that way God's expiry that means these countries if they import oil.  From Iran run the risk of facing sanctions from the US financial institutions will be not be able to access the US financial institutions now already in anticipation of this the crude oil has run up its nearing dollar 2075 of barrel EK bhattacharya. You can be to begin with first thing I would like to ask you is is there a still chance that they u.s. May relent a bit and allow these countries to import oil at a slightly lesser rate so that the transition  Smooth seeing that crude oil prices have run up. Well, nothing can be ruled out but it seems that the manner in which the announcement came would suggest that the denial of waiver is now serious and here to stay because they have Club to countries like China and India in the same basket. So if India had been treated differently I would have said that yes, there is some scope for some negotiation consultation. So therefore I feel that India must try  Try to negotiate hard with the us but then India is in right now election mode. There is a government in place for the government is not really I would say fully functional in that sense. So it is at this critical juncture that just second me. We were extension issue have come up. So therefore I am not too hopeful that India will escape from the denial of waiver Clause from the US as far as Iran's oil supplies.  Ascent so at least the new government is formed I would imagine India has to weather the storm so to say and it will mean hardships because the national crude oil prices have already gone up as you rightly pointed out. Iran is the world's sixth largest producer of oil if in on supplies not going to be available to its many of its consumers like China like India, so there is a global shortfall in the availability of  e of crude oil the OPEC which accounts for over 40 percent of the global supplies is already not very keen to increase its output. There is a problem with Venezuela. So the overall availability of crude oil in the world is not very very good. So therefore it has come at a time which will be hard for India and one final point I would like to make is that India has been importing around 23 million tonnes of crude oil from Iran now India's total.  Annual input requirements around 220 225 million tonnes of crude oil as almost around 10 to 11 percent of total Imports that India makes sense only comes from Iran and suddenly Iran was out of the scene. So it will mean 11% the tenth of India's Imports have to be met through other sources. So from the oil security point of view, this is going to be a major Challenge and a big headache for whichever government comes to power after 23rd of May. I just want to  give some numbers for the benefit of our listeners are crude oil imports last year were hundred forty 1 billion dollars, which is about 27 percent of our total Imports of five hundred seven billion dollars and more importantly these rows 30 percent last year. We already seeing prices have strengthened to up to Dollar 75 of battle. There is a policy calculation that India can maybe whether up to Dollar eighty a barrel, but beyond that it gets difficult for us in terms.  Of a current account deficit starts to deteriorate it starts with impact our fiscal deficit and eventually inflation's and the whole macroeconomic balance that has improved through software crude. Guess then gets upset. Do you think things can really get that words before we find solution to this issue or the softness in global demand will ensure that Global growth will ensure that situation doesn't become so alarming but at least it will be difficult for us situation will not be so alarming as you saw.  So two two years ago when the crude oil prices went up to as much as 150 160 dollar a dollar. I don't see the crude oil going Beyond 80 75 or 8 is already reserved D5. So maybe it is because you have won the US Shale, which is believed to become viable moment. The crude oil prices go above $75 have added so I don't see that. We are going to see a long period when Indian economy will have to  Stuff that girls impact of high crude oil price, but certainly any crude oil price, which is more than $65 a barrel will have an impact on India's macroeconomic imbalances. If the crude oil prices go up by $1 a barrel then its immediate impact on our trade deficit is around 1.5 billion dollars. So that is the simple calculation then you can imagine that if prices have already gone up by around a couple of dollars.  Hours for Baron already now its impact will be bad and our exports have not been doing very well, although in the March figure shows that it went up almost by ten percent compared to the previous year same page, but we have to look for new sources of supplies Iran also offers us some benefits like it offers a 60-day credit and the quality of the Iranian crude oil is suitable for many of our refineries. So therefore denial of Iranian crude oil will be  Also be a financial setback of sorts where our Indian refineries who had a better question in terms of payment mechanisms will have to look for supplies either. They have to go to the US they may have to lean on UAE and Saudi Arabia, but they go for the spot crude oil prices, which are rising in the earlier episodes of such sanctions. We had worked out a rupee payment mechanism with Iran through yuku banks. I remember now looking at  At the stone s of USS specifies this time that mechanism it does not seem likely that they will be able to use that mechanism and useful tone and allow it to happen. So what do you think that we now have to prepare for stopping Iranian crude imports? You know my sense. Is that our relations with the u.s. Have suddenly come unstuck not just some of the Iran oil issue, but also in another issue on GSP. Now remember that II met the deadline for data on all waiver end.  And forth of me the GSP preferences to treatment to India's exports to the US will come to an end and all this is happening when India is an election mode. So our River negotiating level is not very strong with the u.s. Right now. So therefore we have to wait till the elections and the new government is in place and then to see how the new government actually deals with this situation till that time. I think they can Ami will have to weather.  The storm of higher crude oil prices Supply disruptions if India Indian diplomats trihard, maybe they can see a month or two months waiver extension to the waiver. But given the list of countries that have been named because some countries like Italy and turkey they've already stopped importing it from Iranian crude oil. So suddenly India and China there are already singled out. I think Taiwan Italy and turkey have already stopped buying from  So us has a bargaining position telling the Indians that listen and the Chinese listen, you didn't listen others have listened to our neighbor. So you physical differences. So I think we are heading for temporary disruption of sorts and let us hope for the best thereafter. The new government is in place. This situation is sorted out stock market already seems to be that when we have seen the sensex falls about 500 points over the last two days, but looking at the government response is  said today that it is adequately prepared to deal with the situation without giving obviously giving the details of what it has planned. So two things one is that while Indian refineries were getting this crude from Iran refineries are lot more versatile than we have then in South Korea. Let's see and they are able to process all kind of crude. So in that sense, we have a much wider basket to access then some of the other people who is the situation. Secondly Saudi Arabia has said that it will try and keep  Production up and there is no disturbance. Once they stand is in place. Do you think that offers us some despite these things and maybe the situation may not be seriously. I don't see the problem on the supply side in essence the availability of crude oil to those who need it for processing and converting them into different petroleum products will not be an issue. The problem will be the at what price you can buy them now, of course world's sixth largest.  Is of crude oil that crude is not made available. The global crude production is around 4.5 billion tons. Now India gets to 25 million tons out of that. Maybe India's share is very small. So I don't think getting crude oil will be an issue but getting it at what prices can you get it at $70 which you are getting killed a few weeks ago, or do you have to budget for $80 a barrel for the current Year's?  Months Financial year and if that happens it has an impact on your oil subsidies. It is an impact on overall economic growth. It has an impact on your foreign trade situation because you need to export more and finally it is an impact on the current account balance. So I think the macroeconomic challenge will get to more difficult. We have seen over a multiple cycles that we are extremely vulnerable to the spike in crude prices or Imports a gradual.  Only because reproduction hasn't kept pace you see Bombay highest declining year after year. So whenever prices turn adverse to us, we see our macroeconomic balance has deteriorated sharply. Now, is there anything that can be done over the long term to address these issues? I mean, it is offered that Renewables. We are focusing in a big way shift to electrical Vehicles is where coal resources come into play is another idea. So is it possible for us to gradually over a period of her?  I'm at least take the incremental demand that is coming into the market. We have been really slow in responding to the oil sector challenge. There is an old saying that you must fix the roof when it is not raining now. I think the oil prices remain very benign for several years. And I think we have not been very prompt in taking full advantage of that benign oil scenario and bring about a necessary reforms in the entire energy sector. We have not really invested enough.  Off with determination and commitment to give us boost to exploration activities. We haven't focused enough on the need for conservation. We have begun very well on alternative sources renewable sources of energy, but I think time has come we need to give greater impetus to that and finally on the pricing front. I still feel that we have not yet made our refineries as sensitive to the  The principles of pricing crude oil for processing so I think the host of reforms in the oil sector need to be undertaken and when crude oil prices when low relatively I don't think we were quick enough to take those decisions. Probably we can only hope now that when oil prices are still not that allow me Glee high, but the Iran oil waiver issue should be kind of a wake-up calls for us and for the new government to take necessary.  Necessary steps so that this doesn't continue to be a big challenge for sustained economic growth in this country, you know, by the time this entire story plays out in terms of oil prices. The elections will be over and the government will not be under so much pressure to you and is the prices through taxes. And also do you see the consumer button Rising if the crude prices were to actually rise because there will be no political component able to hold them back I think in spite of pressure on  Higher crude oil prices for a few months in the last couple of years. The government has held its ground by not rolling back the retail prices except once it is true that during the election we the 10 percent rise in a crude oil prices in the last one month has not been allowed to be transmitted to the retail prices. But the fact of the matter is this that is the retail level particularly with regard to petrol and Diesel and ATF. So yes, the consumers will have to bear the burden.  And because the government's finances are not unlimited. They must show fiscal prudence and take long-term measures to make sure that there will ability of crude oil prices within the country at adequate and meet the domestic demand. Thank you very much.

Is not in a very good balance right now. I've been talking about this on various social networks over the past over the past little while and I want to talk about it and discuss the discuss this topic on the podcast. I think if we attack this if we attack this topic and we discuss this topic and we and we delve into this topic. I think it can help a lot of people who are listening to this podcast and I think it'll actually be very very good for myself as well. I find that when I talk about  Whether it's to myself in this kind of podcast form or to someone else in real life or whatever it is often. It really helps me. So, you know the past I would say three to six weeks and most facets of my life. I'm not super happy with how I have been choosing to spend my time. When I look at my personal time, even though I have personal time and I'm putting time and energy towards things that matter to me that I enjoy. I'm not spending them in the way that makes me happiest.  For example, when I look at the amount of YouTube, I'm watching I enjoy watching YouTube that is something I enjoy doing in my free time. But I'm so I'm watching too much like I would rather be doing other things with my free time and not spend that much time watching YouTube in other words. Maybe I'm watching whatever it is 5 hours of YouTube in a few day span and instead, I'd rather I'd rather be watching 3 hours of YouTube and doing two hours of hanging out with the  Friend or something like that. I'm just not happy with the balance of where my free time is going at work. I'm also not happy. I'm working as much as I typically do not is not really something that is changed. But when I look at what elements of my work, I am putting at my attention on I don't feel right about it. I think it's too much time going towards certain things and not enough time going towards other things and that is a little bit of a problem when I look at my health and nutrition.  I'm not really happy with where it is. I am sleeping about the same as I typically do but I'm not getting the same quality of sleep that I would like to be getting in comparison to what I used to get. I'm not getting the same quality and I feel that and I don't like that. I look at my nutrition and I'm not eating as well as I would like to be eating and I haven't been doing exercise for a good six weeks. Now, that's a problem. I was in a really good stretch for anybody who remembers when I came back from Taiwan.  One I had a really good habit in place for a long time. There was a good I mean, I don't know four or five maybe more months where I was doing really well with my acting my physical activity and fitness and things like that and the past six weeks. I've fallen out of a lot of those those positive those positive habits and you know, these are things that are not good and I want to share this here because I think there's probably a lot of you who  Either a are listening to this and thinking to yourself that man. I'm in a similar position right now. I'm not super happy with the balance of where I'm spending my time, and I'm not happy with the decisions that I'm making and even if you don't feel that now odds are that you felt it before or you're going to feel it at some point in the future and in my experience whether it has to do with language learning or really any topic, sometimes it's really difficult to see where  You are like to see to really understand what you're feeling until you hear someone else talk about that feeling often with myself. I find that someone will say something that I believe in and that I have believed in for a long time or that or that I feel I feel the same way as the person who said it but I didn't consciously realize that I felt that way until that person said it and then I'm like, right I believe that you just put that you said that  That in such a clear way and I didn't know how to express that feeling that I had inside me. Great. I have this extra level of clarity. And so hopefully me sharing this can give a couple of you an extra level of clarity of aha, that's kind of what's going on right now. That's why I don't feel quite right. That's why I'm not as happy as I typically am right now or like oh right six months ago. That's why I wasn't feeling quite good. I wasn't doing blah blah blah. So hopefully this helps a couple of you.  How you know reach that extra level of clarity? I will share this today is a much better day for me and yesterday evening to about and yesterday as a whole lot actually has been a much better the past couple of days have been a lot better and I have been better with that level of balance. For example yesterday when I eat when I ate dinner, I had a cucumber like half of a maybe 40% of a long cucumber and I had half of an avocado with my dinner.  That was a good decision. I have not been eating enough vegetables with my dinner for quite some time. So I felt really good about that. I had a pre bedtime snack and I ate spinach with my snack. Like I had some hummus. I had some some pita bread with it. And then I had some spinach and I was like, yeah, this is again not the most healthiest amazing thing in the world, but definitely pretty damn good. So, you know, I slept a lot better I made.  Sure that I made the right decisions to make sure I can get a better quality of sleep. So ultimately I'm doing a lot better and I want to continue that continue that positive that positive momentum changing gears a little bit. I want to go in a language learning Direction seeing as this is obviously a language learning related podcast. Um, and I I want to talk about something that has been on my mind which is about  Rote memorization or rather wrote language learning strategies. Maybe that's a better way to put it. So when you look at a lot of language learning classrooms and quite honestly, when you look at the mains many of the mainstream beliefs around how one should learn a language based on their personal experiences. There's quite a few people who believe in and very let's call it traditional wrote style of language learning strategies things like doing a whole bunch of work.  Eats things like writing out verbs over and over and writing out their conjugations things like doing a whole bunch of repetitive practice dialogues from a textbook. These are things that people many people around the globe around the world that they do and I want to spend a minute or two discussing these because I personally am a little bit maybe a little bit conflicted about them on one hand. I believe that they are ineffective and they're not very  why they're not great because they're so done engaging they're so boring most of the time and therefore it's something that is difficult to learn from often when it comes to learning a new skill. It has to be something that engages the mind and that gets you interested that keeps you engaged for lack of a better term.  On the flip side a part of me also believes that these rote learning strategies are also quite effective and can really assist language Learners quite a bit because when you take out a piece of paper and you do these drills and you're writing out these verbs over and over or if you're doing spoken drills with different with different, what do you call it with different?  Repeating certain scripts over and over like repeating. Hola como estas. Oh, I stoie bien Hi, how are you? Oh, I'm doing really good. How about you doing that repetition over and over will help it stick and I'm conflicted and I'm trying to figure out in my own mind. Like where is the line is it effective is not effective. Should we be doing rote learning strategies? Should we not I think my opinion as of today as I'm recording this in December of 2019.  I think we're my mind and where my beliefs relieved lie, as of right now is that they work rote learning strategies are effective but only to an extent. So if you're struggling to remember for instance, the past tense conjugations conjugation rules for verbs in Spanish and you just cannot remember them and you keep forgetting them. I believe that it is going to be an effective activity and an effective drill.  You just sit down for 20 minutes a day and actually write out seven different verbs in the past tense. I ate you ate. He ate she ate we ate in Spanish. It's way more complex than not an English is actually pretty easy. It's always ate but write it out over and over and over do it with another verb right out some practice sentences do the same thing again tomorrow. I think that can have that.  I'm be effective and eventually your your brain is going to remember. Oh, yeah, I ate you ate it all over. Oh, yeah. I did. I walked I and your brains gonna start getting used to it and you are going to become a lot more familiar with that over time by doing those kinds of wrote boring types of activities. But here's the catch. This is where might this is my opinion as of today. There's a catch where eventually  The effectiveness of the wrote style of learning where it tapers off. It doesn't quite it doesn't help you as much after a certain point and you have to start following up that rote learning strengths look rote learning strategy with other types of strategies. So for example, you know, let's say I was consistently forgetting some verb conjugation. Let's stick with that example and I spent all this time writing and over and over I did these written drills I did worksheet.  It's and now my brain understands these conjugation rules on a theoretical level. If you give me a worksheet, if you tell me to write it out I can do it. But now in order to transfer that skill into a real-world environment where when you're speaking with an actual native speaker, and you actually are in a situation where you must you have a need of communicating something incorrect, you know in a grammatically correct way and saying it properly and getting your point across, you know, that's it.  French skill set. And even though you've done a hundred worksheets, even though you've written it out a million times, even though you've done those you've done your role plays in class, right? Even though you've done it. It's a completely different skill set being able to apply that in a real-world environment and you will likely have to practice in real-world environments for the skill of writing it out on paper and doing rote memorization style drills. You're going to have to do something different in order to transfer that skill over.  / and apply it in the real world. In fact this in my perspective as I'm pondering this right now. I actually think many skills and life work this way. If you look at being a I don't know being a surgeon my assumption. I don't know a lot about being a surgeon but my assumption is that you've got to write a lot of theoretical tests. You need to really understand on a theoretical level. How does the body work? What is human anatomy? Like, you know you have to  The organs you have to understand the theory of what kind of scalpel is this? What kind of knife do you use in this situation? How do you operate on a kidney? How do you operate on a foot? How do you do this? How do you work that machine? What do you do if the blood pressure drops during the surgery? What do you do if the person wakes up from the anesthesia? I'm sure those all sorts of theory that these surgeons have to learn but being able to apply that theory in a real-world is something that's completely  lately different because maybe they know okay if the person starts to wake up from the anesthesia, you know, I'm supposed to follow this procedure. I don't even know what the procedure is, but I'm sure there's a procedure to follow but maybe what they didn't expect is a person wakes up from anesthesia and they start to get scared and like oh my God, what do I do? And then the nurse who's helping you out knocks the scalpel off of the counter because she got startled and you're like oh and then you get startled you being able to  Handle that situation is completely different than you being able to write the test and and complete the test in a classroom environment though for you to even have a shot at having any level of success in the operating room. You probably would have had to have learned the theory and studied the theory to an extent and done some of the memorization drills and written the test done. All of that. You would have had to have done a bunch of that first in order to even have the shot and a prey  Rare of being allowed into the operating room while language learning is nowhere near a life-and-death scenarios such as an operating room potentially could be and there are there are way less dire consequences of making a mistake with a language. Then there are in an operating room as a surgeon. I think in many ways these Concepts kind of apply if you haven't studied something in a classroom environment. In fact, let me rephrase that if you haven't learned how something  Works and on a theoretical on a knowledge base level whether that be in a classroom environment whether that be because you have someone taught it to you whether that be because you followed a study at home program hack whether that be because you went to a real life scenario made a mistake and learn from the mistake and you thought about it and he pondered it and blah blah blah, you know, and unless you'd actually spend some time learning how something worked there's no way you're gonna be able to properly apply it in their interest.  In a real-world scenario, it's going to be really difficult and therefore using a rote learning strategy is one of many techniques that any of that language Learners can utilize in order to learn the theoretical side of how something works in a foreign language. Please understand that it's not the only way that's not the only way that a language learner can learn the theory there are so many other ways you could do it, but I think  Stan's my position as of today as of this December 2019 is that rote learning strategies are not necessarily bad, but it's less than half the equation. It's just one tool that partially remedies and partially solves the problem of not knowing how a specific thing works in a language and being able to get closer to understanding it digesting it and being able to apply it but it's not going to be the only thing that  one has to utilize it reminds me actually have a podcast. I heard it reminded me of I don't know if you guys know of The Joe Rogan podcast. I don't list. I think it's called The Joe Rogan Experience. I don't listen to every single episode to be perfectly honest. I just listen to certain clips from time to time on YouTube. If I if it happens to come across my feed and there is this one interview this one clip that I listen to whether discussing they were discussing. It was either being  Bodybuilder and something with physical fitness or it was around financial success. I don't remember what the exact conversation was. My gut is telling me right now that it was about physical fitness that's kind of where my mind is going and her on bodybuilding. It's kind of like saying if you look at bodybuilders, you know, all of them have big muscles and let's assume that they're very very strong and very good shape and it's like saying, oh all of them drink  Water that's why they have big muscles. It's not true. Right? Yes. They drink a lot of water. Yes, that is important. Yes, that is something they have to do but it's not the only part of the equation they do so much more. They go to the gym. They eat a certain way. They have personal trainers. They they they learn about how the Body Works they they learn about how to recover when they have an injury, they learn the so much that they do and it's not just about drinking water and I think that  When you look at these wrote strategies and really any language learning strategy, I think anytime someone goes and puts all their eggs in one basket and they say that this strategy is the way you know, I always go in my mind. Yeah in many ways sure. Yes, and it's probably a part of the equation most likely or it'll work for some people but not exactly for everyone and this that the other thing so this is a definitely a massive thing that was on my mind today that I wanted.  To share on the podcast the final thing. I want to share and then we'll wrap this podcast episode up has to do with my personal Mandarin my personal Mandarin studies and I want to share a learning point that I've had a bit of a realization that I've had that I believe can help a lot of the people listening here on this podcast episode. So recently in Mandarin, I've hit this kind of level of comfort. I've hit this this point where I'm like, wow, you know what you could stick.  In front of native speakers and while I'm might still struggle while I don't know all the words while I still haven't studied all the grammar. I've achieved a certain level of comfort where I don't get as nervous as I used to and I'm able to navigate situations way more than I could before I had a I had the situation yesterday where I was with a friend of mine and we were hanging out and she speaks Mandarin. We only speak in Mandarin together. It's kind of a new friend that I've made recently.  And she was helping me with some my Mandarin studies. I helped her with some Spanish and English things like that. She helps me with mandarin and we're sitting there together and we're going through this particular page in my textbook and she's like has earned. You're still taking Chinese classes and I was like, yeah, I still take classes. I'm still learning. Like I still have a long ways to go and she goes but but you can understand everything I say and we can talk about anything and you can get your point across. I understand you you understand everything I say.  She's like, why are you learning? She's like, why are you learning Mandarin? Why are you continuing her studies and makes no sense. You're already fluent and that in that moment. I was like, oh is that how I'm viewed by many people are there people that view me that way like, oh, he's fluent. Why is he still learning? So that was a big moment for me like a big moment of success and second of all what I told her and this is I think many language Learners can relate I told her that yeah, of course like yeah, we can sit down we can talk.  Talk we can we can we can and we can we can we can communicate and blah blah blah, but I still have to stop you sometimes and say hey, can you repeat that or I'll still have to ask you o what does that word mean? And you'll have to use a synonym and then I'll understand it or then or you'll have to explain it and then I'll understand it and she's like, it's not a big deal. I was like what's not a big deal, but I want to get to a point where I almost never have to ask you to explain something. I almost never have to ask you to repeat something. I almost never have to be like, how do you read that character? Like I want to get to that.  Late fees like oh oh and anyway, what I wanted to point out was a couple things first of all, it's been a five-year Journey for me. In fact, maybe even a little bit more than five years if I'm thinking back, I believe my Mandarin Journey started in September of 2014 if I remember correctly and we are now in event December of 2019. So when in fact if I'm not mistaken, it's been more than five years now a little bit more.  So it's been a little bit more than five years in order for me to achieve a certain level of comfort with this language and I was reasonably consistent with my studies. There were moments in time where I wasn't studying there might be a three-month stint right in studied and practice vitamin a six-month stint here. Like there were moments in time where I definitely wasn't practicing and studying but I think it gets made up with the fact that I've done a lot of intensive study. I went to Beijing for three months. I went to Taiwan.  Or Taiwan for we think two months. I did a two or three week intensive stint Rose being four to eight hours of Mandarin a day in Calgary. So I was like in online lessons for four to eight hours a day. So that was something I did. So I've done a lot of intensive study. So I think which makes up for a lot of the lulz where I wasn't doing any kind of study consistently so generally five and a bit years of pretty consistent study.  D in order to achieve I would say kind of like a mid B1 level a mid intermediate level which is a very respectable level than in my perspective. It's really to be honest. That's kind of the level that most a lot of language Learners are trying to achieve in their target languages. They don't want to be super super duper fluid like a native speaker. They just want to have a decent level where they can talk to native speakers. They can hang out they can have some friends. They can talk. They don't it's not a huge mental strain.  And so that's the thing. I want to stress for everybody. Like it will take I've said this a million times. It will take a number of years for most of you in order to achieve that level second of all, I want to point out that in order at least in my experience in order to achieve a reasonably strong level in a language. I believe you need a mixture of two different types of language learning strategies that are happening simultaneously at the same time.  Number one you're going to need some let's call it more academic style of learning what I mean by that is you're going to need something whether it's a teacher whether it's a study at home program, whether it's like an unofficial teacher. It could be a friend who just helps you out whether it's like a YouTube video series whether you're going to need something that helps you build the foundations in your target language something that helps.  Understand at least at a basic level how some of the pronunciation Works how the writing system works how some of the grammar points work how what's the difference between this vocab word and that vocab word like you're going to need something. It doesn't have to be super structured and super traditional or super boring, but you will need something that is slightly more. I'm going to use the word academic something more on the academic or structured side of things to help you build.  Build the foundations of the target language and then on top of that you're going to second part of the equation, which is some more casual styles of practice listening to music doing language exchanges traveling abroad getting a boyfriend or girlfriend and dating someone for a bit volunteering somewhere and getting some real hands-on experience could be something like who knows right could be there's a lot of ways could be starting a YouTube channel where you try and talk in the language.  Could be who knows something that's more casual something that is more taking place in the real world. I suppose you could say in my perspective. I think a healthy balance of the two is a formula for Success at least for me in my experience and based on what I have seen what works for different language Learners. So I want to talk about that. I want to share that piece of advice for you because it's been a big thing that's helped me in Mandarin in French and in Spanish and heck even in Gujarati and every  And every foreign language, I've gone out to learn that has been a massive a huge part of the equation for me, and I think I can work for a lot of you too. Anyway, this is gone for good 25 minutes. So, I appreciate your attention. You guys are the best and we will talk very very soon. Bye for now. See you.

I what's up guys as we saw the other night, Michigan State beat Rutgers by 12 points, but that's not what this podcast is going to be on because as you all probably give a shit last about that game, but we're going to talk about rocket watches injury and next game is at Saturday against Oakland Caesars. But yeah, let's get into it on so I we actually just told me I'm a sports agent talked about this beforehand that we believe this  Countries were standing there saying it is. Um, I don't know if you saw bro, but he won on the some kind of podcaster radio station last night and basically was talking about the injury dude, and he said Mike from Moneyball. Yeah, since it's hurting him that money going awesome. Yeah, and I maybe thats reason why he came in late to Michigan State no one even mentioned that maybe you think it treatment on I don't know. But anyways guys, so what it originally started off with Tom  Is it saying he'll be out, you know for Sunday's game against Proctor's it could be you know a day situation, but then the people that were on campus saying well now he's in a boot, you know, he had snap chats with the boot so I can confirm that screw. And then now it's to the point is I was saying the other day that are you currently paying off student debt interested in improving your financial literacy or looking for new ways to earn income and today's ever-changing digital landscape on the talk money with mesh lakhani podcast.

Oh now my Pita week to week to week basis any might be out.  He's right about that. Let him talk about in a minute. But that means that's what it sounded like to me guys. It was a was it a stress reaction if I'm not mistaken. Yeah, something wrong with this dress. Yeah, so the stress reaction guys and it's now as I was saying, you know could be he could be out a week and then I don't know if it's true, but I heard someone say week the week and that's exactly how the jobs Lankford injuries started out. But yeah guys, that's basically where we're at with rocket. I think the news is a lot  Not this he's not the news. I think the injuries. I'm not going to say a lot worse, but it's definitely a little worse than what they say to that person. What do you what do you think about the whole injury and just about everything? You know, you could I don't care whatever you want to talk about. I mean, I think it I think it could be something minor like like what they're saying is just taking a little bit longer to heal than expected. But to there's that possibility that he could be out for the whole year like we don't know dude like it sounds crazy to say but they did the same thing with link Roots like I don't know what to say.  Spectrum like MSU be Ballin understand football they always lie to us about injuries. And I don't know why it's a good point that you just brought up because I want a lot of you guys to listen when he just said they like did not that they lie to us, but they're very they don't inform your very big brother just raw numbers are very stingy with like giving out information guys. It's not like the NBA were all these guys are calling. Whoa Janowski telling them what the news is Michigan state is not liked to open their mouths about certain shit, but I mean with that case  Eyes, that's why we never you guys are asking me. You know, what are we gonna do for whatever its football fields of corn at all this I tell you I don't know because dantonio doesn't say shit. I mean when slurry comes on here and I'll text them here and there dude. He doesn't know half the stuff. I mean, so basically guys, I mean we can we can talk a little more about it because we didn't really discuss that much but  Another thing I wanted to bring up just because people are going to buy one each, you know here we have to think what do you think about the whole medical staff and you know, you know, I mean you saw the post I made guys about the guy in Twitter saying should we start questioning the staff? Oh, yeah. I mean, what do you think there's you know that it's just bad luck or like or it's actually a terrible medical staff because at this point, I feel like one year you can say, oh, we got unlucky with injuries, but it's become.  Like a theme in the pattern, especially the football thing like since 2016 did we have been just absolutely plagued by injuries, like like like I've never seen before it's ridiculous, especially in football and basketball. I feel like it's been more unfortunate. It's not with medical staff will feel like they do a good job, but the football team and Spotify you can listen to all of your favorite artists and podcast in one place for free.

So you never miss an episode of MSU sports podcast that it's a concern. I really think someone needs a change there and I was going to just break before you said that you're like reading my mind. I was going to ask you when do you think the injury is started and to be  Did you do I don't remember the football happening until floor key sophomore year. I mean, yeah, he got hurt that game against Michigan not even the work you guys I'm just saying in general major injury, like I don't ever since he broke his leg against Michigan. Okay, but he believes he didn't even play that year that they just threw him in for a game. Like I don't the McDowell injury that your do those this car. Was it McDowell Malik McDowell. Yeah, but I mean other than that.  Didn't get hurt that your two Bridges about for a while to not yeah, but I didn't mean it like that year.    Valentine missed a few weeks at his senior year, but that wasn't any major and then it started coming up guys then it was Ben Carter for basketball and that it was obviously Kyle arms the last basic last three to four years. It's been hurt. But yeah, I mean, I don't really know but I wanted to you know, just talk about that because a lot of people do a lot of people are going out my neck for that one saying, you know, we have one of the best medical staffs in the country. You don't know what you're talking about. And like I said in the post guys I wasn't  I've seen the medical staff. I just said is it time for them to start? I don't know what the right word is to use but you know just start I guess questions also use I don't know dude like with do cash his family. They that he gets hurt. They say like something like oh it's going to be a month or two like Christmas when he's gonna be back. He's back in four days. What is that? Do they have like a special substance like from Karate Kid? Like, what is that? How'd you do?  And that's honestly I don't mean to be like this guy's but that's funny Coach K would literally said we don't expect him back a day before Christmas, maybe New York and he legit like do coverage came on here and he was right. He said he maybe was going to play against us. Yeah, he wasn't he was almost right guys to the deeply the next game a Virginia Tech One game with that injury. What was he maybe maybe was out what six days if I mean, so I mean, that's all topic but that is a good  Point to make you know, that mean basically what he's saying guys is that when they thought was worse ours are steaming like every time we think it's not as bad as it is and it turns out worse. So that's the case with his rocket one. I mean, we don't really have to make this a long podcast, but I think I mean doing or nothing.   Bringing up rocking how and is that the same thing like I don't understand that. He hasn't been really much things good for us to share his thoughts were play solid defense. Dave has been very consistent. I'm sorry if he played more minutes. I think you've been I mean, I'm all right. How about to say that?  I mean you're on the same page as Gabe. Ron II don't know why he wasn't starting to begin the air. I think yeah, maybe a few games. So strong here and there but the thing is he's not just a few terrific said like I don't know if you've been watching us, he's been rebounding awesome crash the boards.   Yeah, but what's he doing wrong? Like you're saying that is those not complimenting some complimenting them enough? Like maybe not is he not also in his heart, but he had that crazy dunk that one game you seem to always go hundred percent, but you know, it is all dude. Like he just really likes lockdown Defenders. I think that's the reason why he's been really Pro rocket this whole time because let's just be honest rocket has been phenomenal on the defensive end but his shots been atrocious and  It's been as bad as probably Draymond greens was last year with golden state and that's a lot. I mean if he was shooting the ball, he was expire guys. Like, you know, we'd be up here like rocket there's something wrong with the rest of the year. She watches the man, but I don't know what happened.   I tried to tell you what happened and you eat it. I mean not that you didn't listen, but I'm pretty sure he's not playing this position dude. I don't think he played that good of art first great player will follow Wednesday. You don't drop see me like three four points per game. It's just how I don't get that should at least be putting up 10 per game, especially if you're starting you did drop 64 your right foot.  But then again, he was a highly touted one. So then the clock, you know, it's like I don't know but I think is over saw an offseason. He was struggling so he said put more emphasis on the defense and that's what he did. I don't know though, dude. I don't know. You know, I'm not I'm not nearly given up on ragi. Yeah. I'm actually you know, but I think the guy is really good. He has a lot of potential but  He shot his husband phone. But to close this out guys. Basically the theme of this podcast was about us saying that the rocket injury could be worse than is Owen all of them expected in that. They're all telling us. I don't know about you, but I don't anticipate him to play Saturday against Oakland. Do you?  Yeah, I mean, like I said earlier if you guys didn't hear me, he's he's been seen walking around with the boot on. Oh, yeah, like I mean dude like oh, yeah, maybe I'm overreacting that but that's the second hit. What dude I still I'm actually seeing things more than the original statement Will C be out for like two weeks and then  all of a sudden two to four weeks six days two to four months out for the year like just progressed and I don't know.  And we're not laughing guys. We're just saying like how the uncertainty behind it is. Like it's just crazy how one minute it could just switch like that, but I don't remember exactly what the length of the injured Lankford injury was a soldier.  It was something less than a month. I remember I want to say I'm like what the fuck is going on? Okay, maybe.  You might be right because I think it was three to four weeks because I think he got hurt like December 20 something and then we were like, all right. He might be able to play. I don't know what the game was. We're like, all right, maybe Michigan know I keep thinking I'll miss you was two months. Yeah, so no, you're definitely right. It probably was a lot shorter than six weeks. But basically guys, I mean like you said, we don't anticipate rocket to play this week. We know we're not experts or nothing. So hopefully know  What listen to this is going to you know, get out our neck, but all we're saying is we think the rocket injury is a little worse than is on them stated up first rocket rocket even clarified that in though the talk show last night saying he's been a sea bass. He hasn't been himself put it in terms sense summer special. I mean, basically  Okay, but here's something out of yeah, but here.  Maybe by mrs. Terrible to say maybe by March Madness. He'll be himself. We don't know guys. He might be back literally could be back Saturday could be back could not play against Michigan for all me and you know, yeah ridiculous. I'm gonna but I mean that's basically all I have to say you got anything else to add, you know, that's about it. Yeah, great this we didn't yeah exactly. I was going to say we didn't want to make this one too long guys and drag it out. We just want to get to the point.  But the last thing I was going to say is, you know, I'm going to text, you know few people that I know that are close to see what they have to say. I'll let you know too. I mean do this is just nuts guys. I mean, no looking for no rocket. No Hauser ovaries. Keep mounting guys. So put it like this. I'd be more surprised to see a tweet. Come in saying rocket is playing this Saturday against Oakland for this Thursday against Oakland, then they started yet then a tweet from the end saying he's out for the year for like that.  Yeah, I'm not going to I'm not going to put it at that extent but I don't know like like I would be more surprised be playing The Saturdays and if he's out for the Earth like it's no I mean, yeah, if you're going to pin me against that that I'll agree with that because I don't think he's going to place at it's just fun and like like like what's his name Cassius Stanley? Like people are like, yeah like Christmas nothing four days later. He's playing like, what is that?  Oh and you know, it's cool crazy. I mean ya know basically that's it man. That's all I got to say. I'll tell you after I was in this like we gotta find a way like if a player is hurting through like a leg injury throughout the summer and throughout the weekend of the year. How is our medical staff not like treating that with Ultimate Care. I don't understand just just telling like to every need he has before after practice. Maybe they are doing that. Maybe it's just another excuse or just something that just came up. I don't know but I just feel like it gets old at some point.  Having a for too long something needs to change and that's that's the landed on guys that statement you just made is absolutely true is of crap. I forgot the last thing you said, but basically he was saying, you know that not that they're lying to us, but that I don't know. I don't even know what to say. I'm not going to spray along with some bullshit. But that's a good statement to close it out on will probably upload this one after right. But yeah, I mean, yeah, yeah, you're gonna want to hear this so I mean nothing more to add on.  I'll be back tomorrow. We got two guests coming on hopefully so they yeah, dude. We're going to be a lot of gas coming on this offseason guys. But yeah, that's it. Basically right man. Yeah. Sure appreciate you guys for tuning in and then go green light.	and   breakdown the Rocket Watts injury and how it may be worse than first told.  We also discuss what this means moving forward for the team.

Barker's generosity in sharing his knowledge expertise and experience through his podcast Rick explains how we can best serve our current and future fans and a no-nonsense and easy to comprehend manner. I've shared his podcast with my vocal students bandmates and local promoters. Thank you very much fat Mandy. I put his techniques into my daily practice the response. I see it's very exciting. I feel like if you're a working musician right now and you aren't listening to Rick Barker's podcast and it's kind of like you're chopping off your own feet and clipping your own Wings. Thank you very much. If you would like to be featured on a future episode of the podcast just head on over to iTunes and leave a review. They are always greatly appreciated in this episode of the podcast. We're going to talk about what to do when someone accuses you of being a racist.  East  Right now is the best time ever to be in the music industry the opportunities to build engage in monetize a fan base has never been easier. So why do so many artists still feel stuck and frustrated because the music industry is constantly evolving and they aren't I created this podcast as a way to help you navigate the music industry to stay up-to-date with the changes to help get your mind focused on what really matters. My name is Rick Barker and I went from living homeless on the streets addicted to  Looks to helping launch one of the biggest stars in the world. I've consulted major labels like Sony and big machine records Talent TV shows like American Idol and the launch. I co-authored the $150,000 music degree and I speak at music conferences all over the world. I have a goal to affect millions of people with songs. I didn't write or perform by helping create. It's just like you get your content to the world. This podcast is one of my ways to achieve that welcome to the music industry blueprint podcast.  Helping you, navigate the music industry. Here's Rick Barker with the music industry blueprint podcast. So what do you do when someone calls you a racist?  First off if it's not true. You don't do anything what I've learned in my over 50 years of life. If someone says something to you and it makes you feel guilty. It's usually because whatever they're saying is true and this particular situation. I just kind of laughed and Shrugged it off. Let me tell you the story. So if you've been listening to the podcast, you know that I do free management trainings and the other night. I'm doing a management.  We're about 90 plus minutes in and I go into QA when I go into QA I'm looking down. I have over 60 something questions and I just kind of going down the list and in the beginning I'm reading people's names. I'm reading their questions and unfortunately if I just sit there and read the question and there's all this silence, so I'll start reading questions and if it looks like I've already answered the question, I'll just say I've already answered that and I will skip on so I did that kept getting  in the same question over and over what genres can I help and I explain to people that I'm not genre-specific because what I teach is artist if an engagement as long as the music's quality and there's an audience for your music I could help you devise plans to build relationships. So I'm going through I'm going through an inside my presentation. I give examples of clients that I've worked with and I shared this is what happened when we got together. This is kind of where we are right now. I have thousands of clients. So I  Can't highlight everyone. So what I do is I highlight like any good salesperson. Would I highlight the successes? I show these are the people that did the work when I tell people about the work that needs to be done. Here's the interesting thing every single one of us has the same amount of hours in the day. We have the same free tools and resources in my situation. I provide the same education to everyone I give them the same.  Mmmmmm opportunities to have success. So for this example, it just happened to be some of my younger artists. So this person writes. I'm not going to say their name because I don't think it's fair to them. But he writes this email is for Rick on the call tonight. He answered questions and he said people's names and when he came to my question, he didn't read it at its in its entirety like he did other people's questions and he didn't say my name and maybe because it's not America.  First off I started chuckling because that night I'd answered a lot of questions. I had / mispronounced a lot of names because I had a lot of people from various countries that were listening to the presentation. So then he goes on to say it's a shame that they're still racism in this world and things like that. And here's what I say to that if the person doesn't know you and the person is making accusations based on what they saw on a webinar. Maybe they should take a look in the mirror and see if maybe  They're not the one who's racist. Maybe they're not the ones that are jumping to conclusions. He also said, you know had he read my question and its entirety. I would have purchased one of his two options. The answer to that is no he wouldn't and that's what I want you to understand as an artist is we're never going to make people happy. But if you know in your heart what's being said is not true. Don't sweat it. Don't try to justify yourself to anyone ever. You are who you are.  I always tell people I'm in a business where I can't make everyone happy every single day. It's absolutely impossible. But as long as I go to bed every night knowing that I don't owe anyone an up an apology. I don't know an apology to anyone for trying to better myself by doing harm to them. Sometimes that was a good day. Sometimes my day is spent telling people no for the right reason some days. It's better I get to tell a lot of yeses, but 90% of  The time in this industry we're going to be told no so one we have to develop a thick skin to if someone goes on your social platforms, they go somewhere and they start trying to draw you into a confrontation. Don't get drawn in take that conversation offline. Usually I'll go ahead and delete and hide the comment all of us have the ability to do that on our own social platforms. Remember, it's your house.  Then I'll message out to that person. I'll say listen. I'm sorry that you feel that way. That was not my intention if you go back and watch the replay, which fortunate for me. I sent the replay out. I said you're going to see that I skip to a lot of questions. You're also going to see that I told you not to put certain questions in certain areas because there's too much conversation and I'm not able to find it and that's kind of what he did second. I explained to him that I was getting asked the same question over.  And over again, so I felt that I had already answered it. But if he took offense to it, I apologize for that. And I move on Case Closed you will never win arguments, especially in the public. If you're trying to do this online when it comes to religion politics racism, whatever accusations that are being thrown out there my job is to not convince people to think like I think  That's not my job and a lot of times trust me in the beginning. I got caught up and doing that. I don't do it anymore. If I feel guilty about something, I probably need to take a look and see why it is that I'm feeling guilty because maybe I am exactly what it is that they're saying, but at this case, it's the farthest thing from the truth. What's even funnier about that is that night when giving people the opportunity to work with me, the majority of people came in were from other countries. This person is just someone  Who has his own Grudge his own beliefs and he's entitled to that. They're his beliefs, but don't get drawn in to those conversations. Don't let it bring you down. Don't let it affect the way that you go about your business. My job is to serve the people that want to be served by me not try to convince everyone to come into my world and that I'm the right person for him because I tell everyone I'm not the right person for everyone. I need people that are hungry.  I need people that are willing to get uncomfortable. I need people that are willing to do the work. I need people that can take instruction. I need people that have such a deep enough why and conviction as to why they want to do this that they're going to get up every day and do the work no matter what I appreciate each and every one of you I hope that what I'm able to put out into the world provides value to you.

spotify:episode:2ZMYiBMDsnJNhHCIOfRxES	Hi, my name is Mark and I'm Hector and where the office lady Mark. No, we're not where the pointless podcast. Oh, yeah the podcast about nothing. We enjoy being a part of silly conversations and talk about every day. Like we also know that there's about maybe a thousand other podcasts to do the same thing, but we're better. I mean sure we have no podcast skills, but we also have low quality audio and lack of organization. Also, I forgot to point out trying to make and worry mark. We don't make points here. We just have a good time with interesting people. We know this is the pointless podcast.  So welcome to the first episode. This is gonna be fun Mark. Whoops. There's gonna be a lot of sound effects from Mark. Whoops. That's the only ones I know how to do and there's no point to it. Hence the name the pointless podcast just fun conversations fun times with people we know and people we don't know sometimes we might grab a stranger to you. Never know. What we'll do two wild and crazy guys, but we're here in Salina Kansas and no one knows where that's at, but it's in the middle of the country and we do stuff we have nice conversation with people.  About everyday things and you might not be for you. I don't know you might hate this but we think it's great. So we're going to do it. I don't be here and there touch-and-go our schedules are all over the place. So our upload schedule may be all over the place as well. It definitely will be so this first episode we were able to sit down with probably one of the most interesting people. I know I've known him. I mean since we were little little kids his name is Ian Nava and he is a very strange man, but we love them. He's a good friend of both of ours and yeah, we're able to sit down.  Have a nice conversation with him. Normally I think this podcast will go where we have conversation with people will play you the highlights and talked about what we wanted to get out of the conversation. But for this first one both of us were able to sit down with them. So really our plan is to play you the edited version of that conversation, right? So as not to bore you but to entertain you and just talk about all the things that life was like growing up here in Kansas and what we did for fun. Yeah. So this is going to be a family-friendly podcast. We're in a really not going to touch on any  Jack's that matter to anybody whether it's politics religion anything like that. We really just want to have some fun conversations. And in this case we were both able to sit down but Mark I think here and they're different episodes. It might be you would somebody and meet with somebody else and then we'll sit down together kind of pull something out of that conversation and just see where it goes. Exactly. I guess a little background on us would be important at this time. Yeah, I guess so I was born in Denver and moved to Salina at the age of six second.  Six years old my second two years old. He moved to smile and covered in the podcast. You'll hear it. You'll hear it with our conversation. And so Mark and I have known each other for a very long time. We're good friends. He was the best man at my wedding. I think it's some point we should talk about that. That was a lot of fun though. Yeah, we should talk about for sure. Yeah, but that'll be four different episode for this one. We had a lot of trouble with this particular episode just because little did we know we don't have the right equipment for well, we had good equipment. We just can't use it all at the same time yesterday we got  What happened? We were fooled. We got two microphones. It turns out you need a mixer if you're going to use two microphones. So if you're trying to start your own podcast out there, let me tell you don't let them get you gang gotta gotta do your research do your research we did not we're like, hey, let's do a podcast. We saw two microphones were like done done deal like my money and now we're here. So this is actually Ian's microphone. Yeah. He's nice enough to let us borrow it. Yes. So, thank you Ian. Well anyway the episode  So we're we're guarding a bobcat. All right, so welcome to the podcast. We've got Ian going. Hi. What's up?  Thank you. Perfect. We've got nothing prepared for this episode. No, it is our first episode including audio quality that ain't prepared Mmm Yeah, it's not but we're here for a great time that a long time. I mean, that's what George Strait says no and put it what we can put in put whatever we  Want maybe half post-production? Who knows what sound effects are going to have. I'm we're going to put one in right here.  Do you guys hear that? That was beautiful nice? Very tranquil. That was great. Anyways, Ian is our first guest. Thank you. I appreciate thanks for coming on the show. Thanks for Lending us this microphone. No problem. That's embarrassing. We don't even we're not even using our microphones we bought because we don't know how to use technology to hopefully over the course of time things get better. Oh conversation topics get better.  We have some it's the first episode it's fine. I just had a sip of my water. I apologize for our listeners. I think everybody just in case, you know, they love it for that unpleasant. Yes. That was hey. Well, there's a lot of controversy isn't there with ASMR people love it. What's your feelings on that Mark my feelings ayat is I feel like if you really like it, you're like it's like a little weird because like they like they like who is nice like, I don't know what it is. I'm children's. Yeah, right.  Like what it's what it's touching and their whole like brain, but they're enjoying it way too much for me to feel comfortable watching them enjoying this thing. Yeah, and then there's Ian then just straight up hates it. Yeah, I really do as far as he creeps me out just people like whispering and chewing next to my ear. I really like or like slashing sounds around you that's like not. Okay. So, okay. How do you feel about it? I think you do you you know what? I mean? Yeah.  Petit go for it. And I just as mates deputies just drinking it. Yeah, I don't know if I would listen to it though. No, I don't think yeah is ASM either like where if you can't sleep you end up having something like that or is it I know it'd be weird. I don't think they would it relaxes some people some people are like stressed out and just having that they love like the pins and needles feeling that it gives them and it comes them down. But I'm not that way like even with like things that normally like comb people stress.  Meowth massage like must likes massager League are like massages stress. People will say I can't say because I've never got a massage or I haven't gotten like a manicure a pedicure or anything like that. But the idea of it stresses me out because I people like touching me freaks me out. Like I like I tense up to getting a haircut is like I'm like, oh really? I think actually I did enjoy a haircut like if I can say it here and so we just like sniff up my hand for 30 minutes. That's like he has a relaxing time. Yeah. Do you remember the episode of Parks and Recreation?  Action when Ron Swanson gets his shoeshine, but he has like a like a bunion on his foot and Andy like caresses the bunion and he starts groaning. Uncontrollable. Yeah, like I have the fiorella some like that's going to happen with me. So I'm always on guard like I will never admit to enjoying anything like that because I because I remember he was like and they'd never talked about it again because I was the weirdest thing ever. Yeah. I'm worried about. Yeah. I just I'm sorry. I can't get over the fact that like things that typically  we reduce stress for others stress. You have a stress me out. I mean, is there anything you do that? You find reichman? What do I do to relax? I don't know what I do to relax. Would you say music? Yeah, probably just like music stuff. But the same time that was stressed me out too because I like if I'm working on like my album or something. That's just work. I guess just I don't know. I mean, you know what I do to relax. Yeah, let's do like calming music. That's that's what I do. I know he was no weird music and that is very true. I have the weirdest taste in music. Yeah, very weird taste in music.  Let me wish we could show we're not technologically advanced enough to show the cut type of music that in listens to we can put some on like on our page though. Yeah, I guess we could do that. We can leave a link for a like playlist of of Ians music. Okay, so he's gonna give us a playlist of his music so much is the man. It's very weird. It is weird music take a listen and you will understand. I'm not sure. Are you familiar with the the hose?  Stinky, okay. We're off to a great start. Are you it's kind of like a mean right now. That's kind of popping up. I get it shows up in sometimes and like YouTube videos as a joke. I don't I can't say that. I am it's like an orangutan. Basically, it's just like it's like this orangutan. That is somebody might like obviously Photoshop their eyes and I found me and like they added like a fart sound and uh-oh stinky, huh? It's like really weird. Is that what you should me? Okay, so there's a whole remix do it then. It's what I do.  What the me, there's a whole remix to it. And it's the Lo-Fi beat with the okay. I listen to It's like so hilarious but it's also extremely call me. Well, I mean low flying itself like that genres of music is very calming nice, especially like Japanese mixes of that. Hmm. I really enjoy that and back in like college days at that was one of the things especially like anime with Naruto. I would have a lot of the Nardo sand track soundtracks with both. I'd be today it was my study music. I think I'm going to bring this up and bring it up. So  The other day and do you know about this story about the Chick Fil A Story? I don't think so. Okay. These are marks laughing and he's saving his water because he knows he was wrong in this.  So sorry those satisfying water. Let me let me come let him calm down. He's he's upset. I was I was a little bit but it's okay. So in any and I we had just finished up with work and so traditionally on Wednesdays we go get Chick-fil-A and sponsor if Chick-fil-A podcast. Let us know. We're big fans big fan God's God's favorite chicken, please, haha.  And so we're in God's favor Jake and play strike there, right? Yeah and well right before that we pulled into the parking lot and we noticed, you know, Mark's Work fan. So I pulled up and I got really excited. So I told Annie I was like, hey, do you want to go inside? I think Marks here and Wednesdays typically the days that he works. So let's go inside and she goes and I don't really feel like it I said, okay, we pulled up next to the van because I saw what I thought was like the running lights of the of the brake lights still on so I figured oh, he might be inside. I don't know. I left a life that I leave the lights on what?  But they were on the back whoops. So then pulled up next to the man he wasn't in there. So I figured we'll just go through the drive-through. So we put our order in and then articulate as you're coming around the corner, there's the glass windows right and any goes how funny would it be if we saw mark up against the window and I said that yeah, that'd be really funny. So we start pulling up and sure enough Mark is sitting at the table at the high-top table right by a window. I'm like a monkey in a zoo. I'm like behind glass eating my meal.  People just staring at me. So we're pulling up and he doesn't see he doesn't see that it does. So I'm like driving really slow like trying to capture the attention at he's not turning around. So I figured I'm gonna call him and Annie goes he's not going to answer and I was like, no marks not going to do that granted Mark always answers. My phone calls, like literally will always answer is a good friend. I'll give him that but on this I can't give him that if there was a lot riding on this my wife was  During me she was at this point saying I dare you to call him. He's not good and I'm over here very confident saying he's gonna pick up so I call and it's ringing I see him grab his phone. He looks at it and then he ignores it. But this phone down at that time. The Chick-fil-A lady is coming up and she's giving him his food. So I was it was almost at the same time.  Yeah, well the food was Liz I saw the food because that was that was part of this them. The decision-making process was the food actually being there. Okay. So the food was there. Yeah and later Jeff showed up at the same time. And so he I don't remember if he rejected the call or if he just didn't answer just like silence it and put it to the side. Yeah. Only being was he didn't watch to pick up his phone. Do you know how bad it feels when you do that?  That and then you look over and there's the dude you ignored look at you with a broken heart like he's looking at you like you just stabbed three puppies in front of them and you're like, oh crap because you can't play it off. I tried I was like old. Yeah said it's an add-on to the stove. This dude has his answers are pod and he goes on sir. He gives he gives me a finger hole, you know holds his finger absolutely indicating. Hold on and then he mouths and  I'm on the phone. Yeah, I thought I could get away with it. So I figured oh, you know, he's on the phone. I'll leave it. He wasn't on the phone now. I love you. I still have light use it as I panicked and that's the best I could come up with. I'm like no, I'm just gonna fess up. I'm not gonna lie. Yeah, that's what happened. Okay, here's my side of the story. It was a very cold day for sure. I already feel you patronizing me. Yeah.  Okay, so it was cold. I was working outside with water. I clean windows in case any of you care anyways has clean windows cold and I was cold and tired and I was really hungry and I go to Chick-fil-A and my good friend Hector calls me and I'm like, oh my God, man, and then my foods like right there just got deliver. Like I'm so hungry. I like I can call him back. I'm calling back. I just live. Give me have a minute just to  Like eat my food and just be like happy and I will call him back huge mistake huge. I look over and his his wife is like super happy because she has just proven what a terrible man. I am and he's looking at me. Like I said, like I am Adolph Hitler like he I am a monster. I couldn't believe I couldn't believe it happened. I think if I wouldn't have put so much emphasis on the fact that  there's no way Mark. What do they always answer my phone call which I 99.9% of the time what do yeah, that's why I was but the one time that you have somebody yeah watch it was a rough day. It's a rough day. You know, I'm not one to criticize because I do ignore phone calls. Yeah, like you definitely do often because otherwise I'll just see about call and I'm just like not in the mood. Yeah. I mean I can understand the mindset. Yeah.  Again, I just part of me feels like Mark knew I was right there. I had no clue. I had no clue. I wish I could go back in time and just be like trust me just take the call. It's not worth it. I was just like I don't want to use my mouth for anything but eating at this moment that I tell you the story. I got yelled at by a police woman in Wichita. Oh, you did tell me that he's going to tell the story again just for a podcast sake.  I'm in Wichita and I'm trying to get to a restaurant and I don't know my way around Wichita that well, by the way, which doesn't games did you just say Richard Richard Tha its riches on that's where all the rich people that's just adding on to not knowing how to get around. I know so little about Wichita. I think it's called Rich atok. Yep. What a fun town. I don't know anything about it. So I'm trying to get across this stupid.  Great that they have blocked off for a parade for veterans. I didn't know this is doing a parade and try to turn. Nope. Can't go there. Go to the next one. Nope can't go. No can't go. There's no detour signs. Nothing to help me out find that get to this intersection and In fairness, there are two roadblocks there, but they're not blocking the entire Road. I can easily get in just fine and I see people waiting there and there please these two police women who are like look to me like they're directing traffic. I'm like, okay. They just want people to go.  Through here and they're directing traffic. No that was that the case we were all felons. As soon as we entered into that zone. We were criminals and the police woman was taking her time to scold each and every car that entered in that area I waited in line to get yelled at is what happened. I had no idea that was the case. I was sitting there thinking. All right, here we go. This is the way that not knowing what was about to come finally realized it when she got to the guy next to me was yelling at him. I just thought because he was  She was kind of being belligerent anyway, so I thought she was just yelling at him because he was that way but then she comes to me and it just Dawns on me. I'm like, oh she's mad at all of us. So I rolled down my window and she's like, do you know what a double roadblock means and I said, well the road wasn't blocked to which she replied. Do you know? What a double roadblock means? I like apparently not. I don't know and she just she like dual you can't go around roadblocks.  Driving into oncoming traffic which I did not do the road was not blocked. Anyways, I was like mmm. Yeah. Mmm. Mmm. Yeah great, huh? Yeah. That was how I responded. She informed me. It was $150 fine. She wasn't going to ride any tickets to which I replied o, huh. Mmm-hmm. Okay and let me go and I finally got across that stupid Street. That's a pointless story. But this is the  In this podcast and it happened to me and it made me angry. So I just wanted to share that one more time. What makes you angry and it's very difficult to get me angry. That is very true. Yeah, I'm usually I let things slide that I probably shouldn't let slide but I would be fun. He's been mugged a ticket today, but he holds no grudges. Oh, that's beautiful. We're going to do two more than me have. Okay. Let's get deep. When is the time that I have made you mad not one time. That's what time I like legit.  It like cannot be I mean I obviously have been here to did I get irritated obviously what you mean, obviously like I get irritated at stuff like you just mean like as a human being you get irritated and that more so obviously with my friendship with Mark I get everything.  Obviously, that's it. I get irritation. Obviously Mark is the worst but I have self-control. I don't know. I just like I said, it's difficult to me. Angry. I think I know I don't think I've ever like literally never been like, all right. What is it? What I do that irritates you I've got 100 with Mike when he doesn't answer my phone.  I think it okay. So I have a problem like where I struggle with doing anything. It's that draws attention to myself. So like when obviously Mark does not have a problem with my cousin Mark does not have that problem, but I'm with him. What are you talking about?  Yeah, so like a bee sting something I bless you you didn't. Can you give me an example? I like that. There's gotta be at least it sounds like there's a story here know that we did the stylizing specific because Mark is always doing something but so my earlier remarks we're obviously with Mark obviously. It's a friendship there. I mean, but it keeps things interesting. So I like I don't I hate that much but it's just like something I'm just like, oh my God, please stop.  No, can you ever think of some examples? I don't know like if you makes like a like a really awkward quippy remark just like with another person. So let's say you were in the vehicle with Mark when he was getting yelled at by the police officer. That would be one of those instances that you oh, yeah, I would be like I would be a tomato if you read for anyone who thinks that's an offensive comment. He just he means he'd be read I blush you like a lot like my whole face with that. Yeah, that's funny.  No idea you're in you're embarrassed of me. I'm not embarrassed of you. I to the truth comes out. I literally get embarrassed for anyway, if I don't know someone that's talking on a stage. Okay. See ya. I can relate to that because I gots like I literally just like get really embarrassed. Like that's why I like a lot of Comedy stuff. I can't watch because sometimes some of these some of these so like quinzhee for me that I can't like I get so embarrassed like watching it. Okay. I see it's super weird. I don't know why I feel that way. That's kind of why would he do that? But, you know your brother did to me.  One time we were driving down the road and we stopped at a stoplight and to the right of us. There were a couple of girls in the car and it was like late at night. We had just got done cleaning carpets and he rolls down my window like because I I don't like to draw a crazy attention, but I don't think I do maybe Iraq but I don't do like crazy stuff which is this wasn't crazy. I just wouldn't have ever done this Heroes down my windows I get hey ladies. No, I couldn't I couldn't like look I just looked out. I was like I hate  You so much. No right now. Yeah, you would I would definitely say that was my brother. Yeah, I would get physical with him in that role. He freaking out the girls in the other cards, like what is going on? I would get this ago. I was just like without they weren't they were like cat calling us now. He's like they're punching each other amazing. Yeah. That was yeah, that would be a situation you guys describe more of like the the fights with your because there were a lot of fistfights going on with your brother's there were a lot of like, especially when we were younger. I'm not sure you guys  No, but like I used to have actually really bad anger problem is when I was little oh, yeah, I do is banshees. Oh you think just to relate that back a little bit. Do you think that's why now, it's very difficult to get you angry is because yeah as a young you let it all out. He does have an anger left. There's just there's a there's a cap to it and now it's just like well, I can't can't you can't do it. It's like I think because eventually I don't know me. I don't remember like a single moment in my life where I was just like I remember like I know  Like really betting your problems, especially with my siblings, of course, right? But I don't think it was ever. It's like a single because just like, oh man, I need to chill out. I just like gradually just like mellow it out. So continuing with the siblings fight. So all three of us here, I'll have more than one sibling. Yeah on my end. I'm the oldest of three and then marks and you are I'm the youngest of technically for but realistically three my sister lived in another house because she there's a huge age  Difference between us. She's already married. And by the time I was born you can say the youngest of three if you want. Okay and the knee and your I am one of five, so my is a robot. Yeah. I am one of my two older sisters were pretty much moved out by the time I can remember anything. Okay, and it was just me and my two older brothers, so I'm thinking that youngest so mentality wise with siblings you guys.  Have just a different perspective as I do for sure. Yeah with being the older you are the enemy I guess. Yeah, because they own would put all the soup. We would always through to me. Yeah, get on my nerves man. Gosh and to hear the thing I can remember just both my siblings. Just annoying me, right? Yeah, so maybe it's just like regardless whether you the Middle oldest youngest for all just going to be in point at each other. That's definitely true. I feel like and in the dynamic  Make changes because you have a younger sister as well. It was me and my brothers. So like I don't know if you've ever seen Malcolm in the Middle sponsor, they can not even around anymore. Now. I'm going to show for a long time. They can sponsor this podcast. That's a thousand percent accurate. That is the most accurate like sibling show I've ever seen in my life because that's how it was you just like fighting all the time and just like I remember there's this one scene where like Malcolm and reefs are fighting there.  Like wrestling and then you have Dewey in another room like banging his head against it. Like the washing machine is like I hate my life. Hey, my brother's only love me. I hate the guy Jackie wrote as you say. He's like, I hate this. I hate that I only loved me and he just kept saying that I'm like that is how it is being the youngest brother. Yeah, you just here for some you're just banging your head against something talking about how life sucks because you're the weakest of you know, because you're all the rows are bigger and stronger than you are. So you're just screwed.  It does is an advantage of because the age different now that is a difference between us is I learned how to fight my siblings who were 9 years older than me. Well, which you guys have a shorter age Gap. Yeah, there's two years between each of us between each of you guys. Yeah, and then with us its five-year difference between each one, which so my younger sister. She's five years younger than I am and then my younger brothers 10 years younger than I am, right? So for him. Yeah. It's about the same. It's about the same. Yeah now on my end, so my younger brother was a  Me and like would fit essentially like in the palm of my parents hand and now he's almost as tall as I am. Yeah, he's a big guy. So at this point, yeah, definitely there. I don't really see the difference because it's a good fight. It's a good matchup. Yeah experience versus a wall and he's a bigot. Yeah, but it's really cool just a different dynamic because it doesn't interest is between the genders of what your cigar is different who's older. Who's he  Unger and even then at that point, I feel like there's also the whole difference with like when you think of different kinds of families in a sense like culture-wise. Yeah, that's huge because I mean if we think about it, like on my end, you've got both Hispanic parents. Yeah, then you on marks and both Caucasian parents. Yeah. And then with Ian it's one of each that's true. Yeah accurate so you get the best of both worlds you get the Best of Both Worlds Hannah Montana sing about it. You live sponsor you lived it.  Sponsored by this bike has sponsored by Hannah Montana. Please go to download all her albums on Apple music Spotify, wherever you'd listen to your music. Now, you can listen to Hannah Montana in your heart where she belongs anyway, continue Shadow plug that well, I was gonna say I was I was gonna see something pretty controversial but I like Ike the absolutely I get the privilege but also get like the great basic food from the Mexican side. Ah, yeah. I don't think that's very controversial at all. No, that's not controversial. That's a known fact. I mean because II  I look very white people have said that I they don't see like Mike for those of who confuse he's saying, he looks very white not like he looks like Barry White. He looks very white. He said yeah not Barry was perfect. Yeah. I didn't pick that up. I'm also very wide is another sponsor this podcast, please download his album on Apple music or Spotify reverie. You get any of your music? Yeah. So I got the privilege and now that's great. Yeah for sure. I this is a true story. I knew somebody.  Who would sometimes speak in a British accent and they claim he claimed he did it because he read a lot of books what he read British. He Books Okay, and he kinda that gave it accent. I'm serious. There was that was the only explanation he worked for he worked where I work and eventually he was fired because of his faith because of a freak accident. We have a zero tolerance for fake accent. No, no, he's just he's a crazy person, but he  He yeah, he he he said that he had a British accent because he just read a lot of British literature. I mean, I guess my anything grammar like the only situation where I could see that happening is you know, sometimes they will write when they write dialogue they'll write it out phonetically or they're right at how they would say it. Okay, like if you read Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn whenever like Tom Sawyer speaking, you read it as he would say it. So he says like all these like really bad English.  Because that's how he spoke. Yeah. Also, there's a lot of the n-word in there. So be careful reading out loud just in general. But yeah, it was just he wrote so maybe he just wrote a lot of like books where they really wanted to get the words how they how they sounded but he's a grown man. So, I don't know. I don't know how that happened. He's crazy. Yeah, that's that's really weird. I don't know what else we talk about I guess.  I don't know. I was gonna ask you another question. I thought of because Ian we Hector what claims he was born in Colorado, whatever he was pulled our odd. Oh, I have a birth certificate to prove it. I mean, I haven't seen it Hector was born in Colorado for all of three seconds. And then they moved to Kansas. I was born in Denver. He was born in Denver on the way out like they she gave birth to him as they left Denver on their way to Kansas.  I was as a thousand percent accurate until I was six. Okay that was born and raised six seconds years old 6 years old six seconds years old. My younger sister was six months. I don't know about it. Anyways, they were raised in Kansas. Basically we all were were in Salina Ian was raised in a like kind of out in the country because he was by Minneapolis Kansas, which is a really small town. He would live outside of that little town on the  their own property. What is your favorite thing about kind of growing up out in a country setting we've talked about this before but just for the sake of this conversation what your favorite things about growing up in big space out in the open out in the country stuff like that. I think the thing that I miss the most is seeing the Stars like every night because every time we would come home we just be able to like step out and be see the stars we could always see the Milky Way. Really? Yeah Israel is really clear. Just seeing that and like going out in the woods and everything is fun. You know what I miss about you guys living out.  I feel like there's firecrackers involved. Oh, that's even more stories lot of firecrackers Tigers firecrackers. I got shot on my tablet them. Well, that's yes. Okay. So another thing to know about the novel families that they are mean they're crazy guy. Just remember like I've said this before I just be standing there minding my own business and the ground will just explode around me for no reason. Yep, and it's because your dad and your uncle's were throwing fireworks at us.  Because that's what is laughing their heads off. It's like literally what would happen to them? Yeah, so obviously, right that was fun. No, I was I going to say oh, so there's a game. We love to play called Thief which actually is a game. I want to continue to play we need to find a place to play this game. I don't know if I've ever explained it to you before Hector Sophie Fizz. I don't know why I called see if it's more like kidnapping but basically this game  Name is you walk around. I mean it's outside and it's preferably dark and it was perfect at your place out in the country because it was a darling. Yeah, and you walk around in a line and one person is a kidnapper and they're hiding and they have to slowly pick off your group one by one and you know what this is. I think this does not sound familiar. Yeah, so they pick off for Europe one, but I was terrified when you first told me and they have to hide the people and like at your house. I could hide people in the middle of a field and open field and you would never find them because if yeah.  So dark, that's what I miss because it was so perfect. Yeah, I remember being able to hide like dirt because sometimes the Moonlight would like dude, that would be like the only source of light exactly. Yeah and the shadow the Shadows are cast like on the trees. Yeah, I would hide in those. Yeah, that was like the coolest thing and you guys would have seen you just walk by and then you slowly pick off somebody in the group and that was the most chilling feeling to get chilling feeling yelling think that was because we whenever I was like the leader of the group like  The first one out always count off just so I know how many people because you're walking in a line and you don't know how many people are there because you can't look behind you. You have to keep moving forward to keep looking forward. So I always sound off. So I'd be 1 then 2 3 4 You Know behind me? You have sent one two, three four, and you be good then one two, three, four. One two, three. Don't crap. They got it or you don't that's how you knew somebody was gone, you know, yo no ma.  Oh, your anxiety is huge during the game and it's so much fun because the worst thing too is like I would like I just had our dogs you just be running with you dude. I about crapped myself come to us because you hear rustling York, and it was just because I was worried because there are coyotes out there too, though. Yeah. Yeah because I'm get kidnapped and they stick me somewhere and then I hear like the grass rustling. I'm like, oh crap. It's a coyote now just their dogs. They come.  Like her walk away all smug because they knew they scared the baby kind of helped like the lying the Congo line kind of find other people though. So that's true. Yeah, you can follow the dogs and they would sometimes lead you yeah sounds kind of a fun element to the game actually would you be able to go and essentially you would be able to rescue? Yeah. But yeah, if you found that if you found them they could to rejoin your group also if another strategy because like the main strategy was to slowly pick off the group. That was the best way to play his brother.  Had a different strategy because you could just like jump out and scare the group and they would Scout because if basically if you're right in front of the group, they're not going to walk towards you. So the rule is if you see the kidnapper he's obviously in front of you you can scatter and then reform somewhere else. That's the rule because obviously he can't just like stand there and wait for you to walk to him doesn't make any sense. So David's way of playing was hiding and then jumping out with a flashlight and scaring us and then following when we scatter he would run after one person and  That them a friend of ours got so scared. I was already kidnapped. I saw this from a distance. He jumped out right now. He started going and he scraped and hit a trash can flipped over the trash can it's just lied there and I think like they was trying to be like I got you. I got you. He's like, yeah, I know like he's just lying there. Like I know I've kidnapped I get it. I did what's happened? Like it was it was very funny. Yes.  It was terrifying I hated it. I hated it so much. So I think the best one he did was like because I got our driveway if I kind of run on the hill. Yeah, and he like he was like laid back.  Long time I want to play that game again. I feel like it'd be really cool to if like massive snowfall. For some reason we might die not only did kidnap you have to survive you get kidnapped. You lose your coat kidnap just like die. Yeah, so I missed that one time. We played a flag football because that giant field by your house. We could we could there's a size of an actual football field. We mapped out the yards and played football.  Ball on it. That was fun too. So I miss having that space. That was a fun time. What do you like living in town? What's what do you like about living now in Salina? Literally, everything is more accessible. Yeah. That's kind of what I thought. Yeah. That's like, I mean, that's the main thing because like the main thing about disadvantage about living out there was that we couldn't go to anyone because back then gas was so expensive. So our parents couldn't afford us to take us to the town to go hang out with her friends or whatever. Okay. So now like,  Everybody's like really close you can like hang out with whoever it doesn't matter.  Now you kind of had a little bit of The Best of Both Worlds when we talk about this subject with your Ranch out just outside of town just on the edge of town yeah North it was really cool so that there's a property up north and my parents still have where half of them property was it within City Limits and half of it was out so you really when we lived there it was just like a okay if I want to go shoot fireworks just walk a couple yards that way and you're completely legal right? So there were there's a lot of benefits to it.  So like the northern part of Salina is where like the old Celina if you will Celina started expanding towards the South and so a lot of everything was on the south end. So we would get that little bit of like my parents didn't want to just because they were lazy I think no, we're not going to drive all the way over there. They're gonna hear this podcast. By the way. They're the only ones are going to hear that's fucking but it was a lot of fun being able to have my dad loves.  Owls and so we were able to have tons and tons of animals. I think at one point we had like twenty three horses or something like that. It was just a stupid amount. We had chickens we had cows we had pigs kittens dogs mean a little bit of everything. Yeah, that's crazy. I haven't had the greatest track. I don't know if I've told you this but I haven't had the like greatest track record with like household pets for some reason they all run away. Oh, yeah, that's right. Well, we gave you guys I just strike.  Up as we gave you bad stock because we gave you guys a puppy. He was adorable. He was a shitzu puppy black and white if I remember correctly because his dad was black and white but his dad was an escape artist. He could Escape any situation. I seen him Escape. I mean major lockdown he gets out. So when you're when the his puppy ran away, I was like, well, that's just him taking after his death, you know, so that's what I chalked it up to ya. Well, I don't know man. I think it just has to deal with the fact that maybe I just  Always wanted to have the pet come out and like I felt bad with it being engaged in so I had like little turtles. I've had turtles run away outside. There are two quick same thing. I've had hermit crabs. Get out of here. Hey, oh boy. Yeah and never find them again. I feel like the turtles are still there. You just they blend in like they've been with you your whole life really gives a very my back. He's still doesn't know.  Me still outside. That's too funny at turtles run away from you. Yeah, I was there any quicker than you think? Yeah. I've had that almost every single like you could think of within reason. I mean I've had like little geckos that I've got outside. I've had puppies. I've had cats aside from all the like farm animals that yeah, I mentioned earlier I've had fish hermit crabs the fish ran away from you know, what now, that is impressive.  That's a situation those fish. He ran away just rolled his bowl out of there. Yeah. Well Finding Nemo situation. He's in Australia Sydney. He's in Sydney. Oh, I wanted to talk about because he has her talking about animals. I wanted to talk about chickens because believe it or not. I lived a little bit of a farm life because we visit my grandparents all the time and they lived in conquer City Kansas. And so I my Grandpa would take me around. I was kind of kind of funny how it worked my two older brothers. They're twins were my Grandma's favorite.  But I was my grandpa's favorite. So my Grandpa would you take me around like I remember I was like probably about five or six the first time. I saw my grandpa kill a chicken. He was like, this is the way things were like, my he went to my dad's II would take I'll go kill a chicken is there I have the boy codes with me. My dad's like yeah, it's fine. He's to know about life. So I went with him and he grabs this chicken and he sets it against a tree stump that was his execution spot and he had an axe. He just won chopped and  Off the chicken's head now, obviously as a six-year-old your brain tells you that if something loses its head it's dead, right? You do have enough logic at that age to think that's it. You lose your head game over but chickens don't like immediately fall dead. When you chop off their heads their heart is still pumping and their body is still functioning for a little bit after you chop off their that's why the saying running around like a chicken with his head cut off exist because that's where they do. So he chops the chicken's head off.  And this headless chicken dropped to the ground and runs towards my mind is blown that that was he I didn't even know that was even a possibility that this headless chicken is now threatening my life. I freaked out I'm like, oh crap and I turn around run. I'm being chased by this headless chicken. I swear to you. I turn it turns like if followed me. I don't know how this day. I swear it knew where I was and it was avenging its head on me and  then I turned around and it just flopped over because it was finally dead. Okay, so just a little tidbit with that. I did just a quick like Google search just to see ya. So there was a Mike the Headless Chicken. Okay. Oh, I've heard about that. Yeah also known as the also known as Miracle Mike. So this chicken went on to live 18 months. Yeah, it's head was cut off because he did it wrong. He chopped it like too high or something. Yeah. I have no I'm not going into the and he would feed it. He would literally put chicken feet down its throat. Yeah. That's insane I'm saying  I see here is it said that the story was not to be a hoax but then it hurts owner took him to the University of Utah. Oh, yeah, look at this segment will have Mike on continuing a little bit on that so up when we lived at the ranch. So my dad was never the type of individual to be okay with just having like a little bit of something like he has big or go home, right? So we started off with  Couple horses and then we ended up getting two twenty three now. We started off with a couple of chickens, but then we get to a hundred chickens. Oh my good in this like it's for me. Yeah. It was a nice size like little area for them. And then I just remember one night something went down and then in the morning the Revolt. Yeah. I don't know in the morning. We woke up and all the chickens were like decapitated. Yeah now later it turns out raccoons like to rip chicken's head.  Oh my goodness cute little furry animals would just pop off the hinges Jesus chickens. So that was a sight to see my dad. I mean we were baffled that's we had a hundred chickens and we had a hundred headless chicken you guys a chicken out the Wazoo. I bet measure your six-year-old something up. Yeah, and so the next morning my dad, you know he want  To get to the bottom of it hold that like what in the world is living out here that decapitated a hundred chickens. Yeah in the span of a nighttime, so he went out and he bought a couple more chickens. But this time he put him in a different like Coop, right? This one was like a serious. The other one was just kind of like those typical fences at McGuire chicken wire. Yeah that you can put around. So this one was like the traditional like box like with the fancy little like handle and the whole thing where they have like that very,  And very like Tight Mesh where nothing can get in the trunk and get out. So he put the chickens in there and he waited and there was a family of four raccoons at showed up. Yeah, so he took a tree trunk and he beat them and he killed him and I remember waking up to go to school and like close to the doorstep. There were like four dead raccoons liked music erratic raccoon tail tied around his head. He's ahead of said, that's all we needed. Oh my God.  But that was that was probably one of the like scary City scare your situation. That's so funny. My grandpa do the same thing because things would get in and kills chickens and he would one night. He was way too old to be doing this. He was in his 80s and he had a pistol and he decided he was he slept in the chicken coop waiting for who whatever was breaking into break and he was gonna kill me was it was I think was raccoons. It was a mama raccoon and her babies. It's so he like is trying to get the gun to shoot him, but he can't get the safety off because his hands are so weak. Yeah, so he  grab a shovel  Farmers man was on know speaking of chickens and killing chickens. I want to bring up this story these guys over here the Navas their dog had a tendency to kill chickens. And so to teach it like to stop killing chickens. What is it that you guys did to the dog to teach it a lesson to stop killing chickens. Okay. So who's both of our Lord's got involved and it was our chicken. It was it was a neighbor's Chicken on it slightly worse. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah. That's what getting worse because  That was like, oh heck. No, I you know didn't know sorry. He liked he gets upset when our dogs like that's with our chickens, but when they need they mess with somebody else because he's like so he took the dead chicken cut it in half and tied it to our dogs. Okay, for some reason, that's what I envisioned. It's just a rotting carcass next to them.  Just for like I think maybe like obviously probably like for like a couple hours or something. But how does that work that did it do the trick? I don't did it work. Yeah. I mean, I would never saw any more dead chickens because we did have chickens. They knew how to hit them. They taught them to be better at the time. So we didn't see him or chickens that just showed up at our house because I dogs would go after any because we have like a bunch of like wild animals that are else. Yeah, so we got like rabbits and my all other kind of spikes were can't remember watching your  Eat a rabbit, her dogs would be angry. It was oddly peaceful. It seems weird, but I just watched it eat like this rabbit and I was like, wow, this is incredibly peaceful the watch. Wow, then the things that's also very gross. Yeah, but it was peaceful in a way. Also just a quick like funny thing. I remember about jigs actually about roosters, you know roosters get really aggressive enough right couple stories. Yeah, so they go after so my grandpa. There are a lot of there were some kids in the neighborhood and he just it terrified him the thought that a rooster would go attack.  A small kid like walking by their property. So if a rooster ever got like an attitude, he would literally Drop Kick The Roosters he would pick it up and just kick it feathers and fly everywhere and you look at me as like I don't tolerate that because I don't tolerate none of that crap and he would drop kick the the rooster and I remember there was the funniest thing was just old man. Pick up this rooster literally kick it like a soccer ball and just talk about how he does not tolerate any attitude from his roosters. Wow.  Yeah just for us so because it was a it had some property to it. There is a lot of acreage they would rent out stables and of course tables and there's a lot of individuals that would come and would rent and have their horses there. And so these guys would come down and they bring their kids as well. And so we would go play and we there was a game that we would play were the whole point was to not let the rooster get you so each individual will take turns getting into the pain. Yeah it was  It's on you get in there and this thing as soon as you showed up, it was like he took his boxing gloves and then just being young and dumb we would agitate it before right? Yeah, you got as you do, right? Yeah. And so there was we had the sticks that would go through the pain and so we would like to get it was like, okay. Yeah, just like okay, we wouldn't spank it we wouldn't hit it right abusive with it. But I mean you don't like being poked. Yeah, like pink.  Being definitely does not have been. Yeah don't so with this rooster. He didn't like being fucked either anything. It was like he knew a meetings like poking poking their get in. Yeah. Yeah. So what was his name?  Mmmmm Big Ben like he was big and his name is Ben. Yeah, okay. Just wanted to clarify for our list called. Did he look like a clock? No, okay, even remotely no just a really big. Oh, he's terrifying and our dad made him us go. I take care of him because he was in our like kind of like our chicken coop was like actually kind of big like kind of high enough. So it was I you know for him to send them well just be bad because I actually like vegans like pretty aggressive. Okay, so you guys are just put them in there.  Yeah, I'm heading in there and like little do this thing, but we have to go in there and take care of his side note just real quick that giant chicken pit while I was in jail, but that tall chicken pen was a gray jail when we play cops and robbers. We will lock on criminals in the ninth and continue anyway, but I think that my punishment like the most vivid memory of the Big Ben was I was going in there me and my brother and then Big Bend just like I don't know why he's just mad at us for whatever reason and he like literally rants be against the chain-link.  With or without the chili, but they just like that wall the fence. Yeah. Yeah. He's very aggressive go but I still like them love. Hey, there's one time we were visiting we had stopped by your house and my dad was in a suit. He was wearing a suit. Oh, yeah, Jack Jack detective. Yeah, and it was hilarious because he starts to walk to the door and this go like as I know he's not having it. So he starts running for my dad and my dad sees happening and so my dad just kind of grabs by the horns and pushes them back.  That's that's like let's do this for the next five hours to ago. That's what the goat is understanding like oh, yes, like let's do this. So get ready to me and my mom are crying laughing in the car. Oh nice as he is in a full suit fighting a ghost who will not give up. This goat is like I am going to win like this goat is probably lost a lot in its life as like not today. Today's today. I made it all back. Yeah. Yeah and if we were dying because we were safe and we were laughing.  Laughing at his Peril. Yeah. Those Jack is a small goat, but don't medium-sized. I guess he was determined. He was a determined. He was medium-sized. He was he's in size. Yeah, totes mcgoats totes mcgoats. That's very reverent.

spotify:episode:7G4Vp2SR0Yz3vKB9d6mGwU	 You listening to the real down your Premier kayak tournaments or springing you Recaps epic guest upcoming events here. Are your hosts Fred Hicks and Sam Jones.  What's up, guys? Hope you're having a good Friday when you're listening to this Sam. What's up? Not much man. Just sitting out here getting ready for lacrosse putting some stuff together start to pack up. So having a having an Oktoberfest and enjoying the evening. Yep. So you had a pretty big weekend, huh? I saw  Yeah, one too shabby wasn't too shabby. So you went out to a little late called Waveland and caught a few fish. You did more than just catch a few fish. You won the dang thing. Well, you know, hey is my day I guess and I beat Jim strong. Yeah, hold on Jimmy. Yeah, I fished with inside a gym all day and  you know, we got to we got to chat a little on the water. So it was a good tournament, you know, unfortunately for the rest of the field fishing was pretty tough and a lot of guys didn't get to see what Waveland is really all about. Me and Jim were the only two with a with a limit. Actually, I believe there was one of the guy chip who may have had a limit or for fish.  Like that. I can't remember what I heard but never found signal to upload and didn't have enough to really stress about it. So but yeah, it was definitely a tough event. And you know, I was fortunate enough to come out on top. Yeah. I'm sitting here looking at your to 17 inches, man. These things are pigs. Yeah. They're the they're fatties for sure that Lakes got you know, six seven eight nine Pounders in it that are caught pretty regularly.  I mean, even if you look at the 14 inch fish, I caught well almost 15. But yeah that they all had some pretty good girth to him. I mean in a way and tournament that would have been a good bag, you know? Oh definitely. Wow, so and they were they fought to man. They were they were fun to catch. You know, they were deep well wavelengths not a very deep lake but deep for Waveland and you know, it was it was a good time. There's a good time so  is definitely a grind but  you know, I was able to find five of the right ones. Yes, you want to go through those results for that? Yeah. Yeah, we'll talk about it here. So again, there was only two limits caught myself and Jim Strunk. I landed 81-75 Jim coming in at 78 25 really making me kind of sweat it all day.  Funny enough the the to our Shores spots on that life that I planned on fishing. He was on one of them and I was on the other and we neither neither of us never left our spot. So I knew he was going to I knew he had the potential at any second to crack again a six seven eight nine powder. And so did I so I finished the last second and so did he and then rounding out the  top 3 was Randy Doris with 59 25 for for fish.  And then yeah kind of we had Chad Howard and fourth place with 5775 just one shy of his limit and then Thomas McNulty which 4175 and fifth place. So Club Championship 14 Anglers out there on Lake Waveland. I had to qualify for the event through either win an event throughout the regular season or by points. And you know, we got out there conditions were tough.  Russians were very tough. In fact, we had multiple weather changes. We went from 92 40 back to 70 back to the low 60s day of the tournament. We started out with clouds and Rain then it a little sprinkle anyway, and then we had a downpour then we got sun and clouds then clap Sun than clouds with a little bit of rain after the tournament. So kind of interesting weather and it made things.  Go for a lot of guys. Luckily. I was on the offshore thing. So that is little less affected by those quick changes and you know had a good event good stuff. That's awesome, man. So that's your second one of the year, right? Yeah second win of the Year second win in the kayak first championship and the kayak. So super excited about that looking at the two little Club trophies. I got sitting on the  The Shelf over there here in the garage and kind of be prouder. You know now we got one more we got to go to La Crosse and get it done. Oh, yeah, that'd be dude. If you win. That would be awesome. Well, heck if you or Brian wanted that would be awesome. Well, that's the plan man. We're going to go up there and represent it. Hell. Yeah. Hell yeah. Hell yeah, that would be cool.  So there is a there was another tournament that went on on Saturday and you know apologize to tie and Ryan Lambert and the guys the tournament directors over there. We missed it on our report last week, but we want to make sure we go over the results this week. So the tournament of Titans hosted by Native Watercraft went on October 5th.  That was on the Big G, Guntersville.  You know, there were gosh.  I heard there's a lot of guys their ton of guys there. I mean there was over 70. I know I'll look real quick. I'll pull it up here. Yeah hundred hundred eighteen guys competing in that one of which was Bassmaster Classic Champion, none other than Jordan Lee out there fishing with these guys and it was one heck of a lot of it. I watched it all day washed away in live afterwards and  Really impressive. So I'll just kind of round off the top five here real quick. Yeah will do top 10 will do top 10 real quick and you know give these guys some shout outs but really cool event. And I think we'll be seeing some more of these in the future, you know, the winners got like you top five people. I think God to tighten boat and plus was less their price later Max. No, I think I know I don't think it was later Max.  It's a sweet boat though. Cool. Boot. Yeah, I think it was just the regular Titan 10.5 I got was so but Covenant with 9250 and first place Nick Huddleston really impressive bag had a 2075 in 1925 1850 1775 and a 1625. So really strong bag coming in second place with  B5 he was gunning hard for this one Ryan Lambert out of Tennessee. We all know that name third place another angler out of Tennessee John McClane Lima cleanly 91 inches Randall Wallace coming in fourth place with 90/50 Chris Lowe rounding out the top five with 90. Even we had Tony Yang out of Georgia with 88 75.  Five. Mr. Jim Clark himself, Alabama native there 8850 Christine Fisher. No surprise there grabbing another top 10 just crushing it out there this year 87-75 and then our Bassmaster Classic Champion Jordan Lee with 8750 coming in ninth place and then rounding out the top ten.  Drew Russell of Kentucky with 86 75. So there's your top 10 right there. Again, Nick hosting grabbing the wind with 9250.  That's awesome. Yeah, absolutely think big bass for that event was right at 21 inches and you know, really a lot of a lot of big fish actually a lot of fish over 20 cotton out of it. That's cool.  Real cool. Next one we have here is Virginia kayak Bass Challenge Classic on the Chickahominy Lake / river. Shout out to Casey read. This is his Tournament Trail out there in Virginia. First place was Bruce deal. Eighty four point seven five inches second place Steve Bishop 80 and a half inches and third place was Micah Marlborough 79 inches  Big bass went to Dustin good 22 inch bass. So good. Yes it is.  Okay. Yeah, next one we have here Massachusetts kayak Bass Fishing catch em all full bro. This was public Waters. This one was really interesting. So I didn't really read like the rules or anything but after looking at the results, like wow, this is crazy first place Steve and Scott 471 and a half inches. So I think they totaled all his fish. I think they totaled everybody's fish altogether.  So there was like no really no limit. So if you cut it's like I don't I'm not 100% sure I didn't count. How many teen was it was? I think it was 15 baths wasn't it? I'm not sure about that now can a man 471 inches. Yeah, that's great. 271 fish were caught by 27 Anglers.  Group 471 that is awesome. This is no limit tournament says so.  Yeah, so it says is there was way more than 271 fish caught I mean he caught 36 fish total for 471 inches. So it was MLF that style format. Yeah, you know and they got Fish Public Waters so very very neat format and you know his big bass I think was 19 inches.  Steven Scott so really cool. Yeah. Second place was Alan cynic with a four hundred four hundred sixty two and three-quarter inches third place was John Farah 414 and a quarter inches and big bass Cameron Burke 19 and a half.  So real cool tournament there. I like that. They it was just how many you could catch. That's that's real cool. Yeah, I'd like to do an MLF format at some point. I think it would be fun to do. I'm still you know, I prefer the five fish limit. Yeah, you know as far as the tournament format all together, but I wouldn't mind fish and some MLF style events. So definitely look we'll be looking out for  That next year to do one of those. Yeah.  And then the last one we have here is the rtt state championship by the kayak Bass Anglers of Arkansas. Like watch atoll. Chris Jones came in with a hundred seventy inches second place is Jeff Watts, a hundred sixty nine and a half inches third place Steven Lee hundred fifty three inches and big bass was Bill Campbell with 22 inch bass. Okay. So those those numbers I try to compare it to the FLW kbf cup date.  They were around the same type of numbers. It looks like wow. This is a little bit higher. But yeah as a little bit higher and then like the thing with the kbf event, you really saw a a huge drop off after kind of like that top top five. It really kind of started to drift off off. So this is a little bit more consistent little further down.  Out in the field. You can definitely start to see that the lake start to heat up or cool down and the bite start to heat up. So, you know tournament in a Champions here in about a month. It's going to be it's going to be really cool to see what's going on out there. There's been a lot of a lot of tournaments held on this Lake this year and I think we'll continue to see that because it's just it's got some really awesome potential. So Tournament of Champions is on watch at all.  It is. Yep, November November 10th is when that one will be held so and unfortunately, we'll talk a little bit about this here in a minute the Turkey Bowl which is a tournament that I host. I mistakenly scheduled that for the same day as the Tournament of Champions. So some of the guys that would have would have been able to make it unfortunately will not be there. So, you know we  Live and learn. Yeah, it's all good.  That's all we got for Recaps.  Absolutely, not a lot of cool events happened last weekend.  Yeah, you got some some cool events coming up that will be will be talking about here in just a minute after we do an interview with our epic guest tonight.

Welcome back to the real down guys tonight. We have our epic guest Eric Siddiqui. He won the crossroad Crossroads classic and Newton Lake and Illinois. We were just going to get him on and talk a little bit about little bit about that. So, how you doing? How you doing? I'm good, man. Good. How are you stuff, man? I'm doing good. So let's start off by.  You telling the listeners who you are, like what kind of kayak you're in? What got you in the kayak fishing? I'm Eric Siddiqui. I'm from Cincinnati Ohio been calculation for about five years. Currently. I'm fishing out of a ho BPA 14.  And yeah, enjoy it. That's what year is that PA 14. So 2016. Yeah 60 run. Are you gonna get into that 360 Drive Otto will see after row see if I can get out of that 16, you know things got Mojo. Yeah. Yeah one or two tournaments one or two more tournament wins. You'll be fine.  You'll be able to upgrade. Yeah, we'll see. So how have you been fishing your whole life then or just yeah have of Bank fish most of my life. I grew up here in Cincinnati and my mom's from Corinth, Mississippi. So I'll go down there in the Summers and fish Pickwick and just get dropped off the lake and try out different lures and stuff and kind of taught myself how to bass fish that way as I got older I got, you know a little bit.  Better tried some different stuff and then it was about five six years ago. I started watching chat over on kayak Bassin and I was like, I can do that. Yeah, like and I was fishing the lake at the time where I was catching some big fish and I knew if I get out there on it. I could you know Hammer I'm so excited to go get a kayak and went and got one got out there and  That's always your first kayak first guy like was in Ascend FS1 28t from Bass Pro. Nice. There you go. So that's funny. Everybody start slow and then work their way up after a while. Yeah, man. I took all the hatches off it resealed it. I  add a huge marine battery on it to run my lights and Fish Finder. I didn't know anything much about you know, all that stuff. So I just got a big one. It was I got it. They had to weigh 50 pounds and that on the back. Is there a reason you cheaper? I mean I couldn't get a boat on a lot of the lakes that I was fishing around here in Cincinnati. Yeah. What was your favorite?  Steady, like I like I like the gravel pits around Cincinnati. Everybody got overlooked some nobody. Nobody really fishes them everything that gets fished hard around here.  Kind of sucks. So yeah. Did you just did you just try to like Sly your way into finding out Eric siddiq? He's like honey hole is that it's so yeah, we'll get GPS coordinates after this. Yeah. I'm just joking, but let's get into the tournament stuff. This Crossroads classic at Newton Lake. How many days did you pre fish for that?  I got there Wednesday night and I plan on just you know, crashing at the boat ramp and up early and free fishing, but when I got there they were just kind of going off crushing the crush dad and I was like, I can't take this I gotta get out there on the water. So so I got out there and sun was setting as I got in the water and I pulled around in this little pocket that was full of hydrilla and start Runnin ChatterBait over top of it and I had 99  Doesn't two hours out there, so I was there that's pretty special place. We're gonna have fun and get out of there the next day and had some deeper stuff marked. I wanted to look at and on the way I have to say to one of those spots. I found this road bed Ed with a bridge on it that wasn't on any of my maps or anything and and it had some fish on it. So 10 casts I had a 21 and 19 and 18 and a half.  Half and it was decided probably just look for some shallow stuff around there in case I had trouble getting a limit because I know how those roadbeds go like you're tough. So yeah guys there was a connection issue you thought you heard him say Road bed and bridges. He was talking about brush piles and 25th little are you heard that wrong or I think of the I had a few drinks at the tournament and talked a lot. So I figure the Secret's out by now anyway,  Yeah, it's not too much of a secret fear for anyone who's been around the lake long enough. But yeah, very cool. So I know by by you stating that but for the listeners cold water or hot water side, were you on the generating side or the cold water side? I was on the cold water side. Yeah. Yeah. Did you pitch it all the hot water? I didn't I didn't go up there even.  When I got there ones and I didn't really know anything about the lake and I just happened to go up the cold side when I was fishing and I just kind of stayed over there. So what's the temperature difference between how cold was the Cold Water side?  I want to remember it was around 81 maybe. Yeah, since the other side was a lot warmer than that, obviously, so there it was up there.  The 90s resting when I just might yeah, I know it should be in like the high 90s right now in the winter time. So like in January, it should be in the 70s. The weather wasn't miserable. We'd go out there on January 1st of the year.  Now that's cool. It's real cool. So, um did this tournament have like a different field and other major tournaments you've fished.  It was it was a lot of fun. I had a good time. It was kind of a relaxed thing. I went out and that month and I started on Pickwick lake and after that first tournament I kind of decided I wanted to just stay on the road and Fish on my tournaments that I had coming up. So I and I wanted to qualify for some extra money at the cross for the  Alan stuff I'd only fished one online. So as I did I could stay on the road and kind of work my way around the tournaments. And so I Pickwick first which is an Alabama fish that Alabama online Mississippi online Arkansas online and Missouri online. So I started a Pickwick fish that tournament had four good fish the first day couldn't get that last one and I end up with second biggest bass both days behind Chris.  Dean Fisher and so then I had I left there and went to Mississippi official Lake on over there for a nighttime put up like ninety eight and a half inches that day and I went over and fishing Arkansas with Cody Milton stay with him for a couple days. He turned me on to a lake and brought me out there and I decided fish Jackson's tournament also and went out that next day after after a day of fishing the lake and put  109 in between 7 a.m. And noon. Yeah, I select the tournament. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah and up with a hundred and ten inches in Arkansas and then left there went to Table Rock. It came in fourth there. And then I went from there up to Kansas City Fish for with Am A Lash for a day and then I headed over to Illinois and for some by then. I was almost ready to get home, but it was  It was it was good time. Enjoy that tournament a little more relaxed and everything else. I've been through the whole time. I was I pretty much compost everything I wanted to in my trip. So kind of the pressure was off. What do you think about the the team style? Yeah. There was a lot of fun. I like that type of stuff. Yeah. It was a good time. I try to give the guys as much help as I could but  We I think we had a fourth. Yeah, I was about this. That's about to say did you guys like do any kind of strategizing for that tournament or what trying to I mean, I tried to tell them how I was cashing them and what I would do and you know, but everybody fishes differently. So yeah, you know almost in their people by spreading the word too much right? Let's try and do stuff that they're not comfortable with. Yeah, right kind of put you in like the middle.  There because you you're wanting to do well yourself for the individual part, but then the other side of it you you want the team to win also write like it's like you I don't know. It's kind of like I'd be stuck in that situation. I wouldn't know. Yeah, I pretty much told them everything. Okay, cool. I mean everything that I knew I let him let him know but you guys were sharing spots and everything then.  I gave him some spots and stuff like that. I told me come fish out there with me if they wanted but I don't think even really wanted to do that. Yeah.  That's cool, man. Yeah, I've never fished a team tournament like that. So it's interesting to hear. Yeah. The first one I ever did was the team cup for the kbf national championship this year. Yeah. I was a good time. We did early in it. After that first day. We did talk to the guy the guy that was on the winning team of that earlier this year. I think yeah came out of the movie x-series. Yeah. That was real cool. So let's let's get let's get  The tournament day number one go into some detail how you were fishing what you were using like the type of areas you targeted.  Yeah, well see I started out I had a long way to go and I was happy we had a shotgun start. So I was pretty happy that we were able to use Torpedoes that I have one of those on the back for three. Yeah, and I was pedaling as hard as I could and we have that torpedo on full blast to get out there and I still lost five or 10 minutes by the time I got there and yeah, I had a pretty good pretty good morning at.  Three good ones. Well, I'd to pretty quick. I think it was 21 and 19 and a half maybe pretty quick and then I decided it on that spot all day and I got five bites that day and I fish clean Landing them all but yeah, five bites and I know about 95 inches. How long did that take you to get that Linda took me all day. I think I got the last ones out.  Go maybe wow, that's crazy. So what was so special about that spot it held Big Fish. There's a big fish sitting on that spot. I marked them but they're they're kind of scattered, you know, so and but there were certain little sweet spots on there. And when I when I can get on them, right and I could feel when I was on him, right? I knew I was gonna get get bit but it was with the wind and everything else. Sometimes it was hard to get on it. Right, but when I made that cast I could I could feel  I was probably gonna get bit. Yeah, I literally as you're talking I'm like just remembering old trips out there. And I know exactly what you're talking about is like like I'm living a reliving the moment with you, right? I want to get out there man. That sounds like a blast. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I was catching on a big football jig 3/4 ounce. That's one of my favorite ways to catch em, man. Yeah. I'll see your fun. Mmm. I was what's up?  Like Legends or what? Just I rode bad that bridge came up to about 15. I think it was. Yeah. Yeah 19 to 21 foot spa. Yeah. It's pretty deep. Yeah.  It's crazy. Right? What is brave? Oh gosh. I was trying to remember is probably almost what five not quite five miles from the ramp to that Spa like, oh, no it was yeah probably two and a half maybe from the ramp. We launched that got you. Yeah, so it sounds like you know this exact spot then me. Yeah, there's not much on that. Like, I don't know that's another super fun that I couldn't fish it out.  I was surprised when I nobody else showed up on that spot. I was I was pretty sure somebody was gonna be there especially with that. We had sellers on a 25 boat tournament out of the cold side on Sunday and I thought for sure some of those guys know I thought for sure some of those guys were gonna be on it and I left the spot twice because that second day. I had a lot a lot hers. I'm I fished shallow first trying to get on top water bite just caught a bunch of small ones that didn't help and and I said,  To go hit that spot kind of 19 and a half and I sat on it for till noon and didn't really have that's all I had was that one fish. So I made a decision to go. I came came down and looked at the spot and I'm us all boat pull on it and they sat there for about 10 minutes and left and I went up past it and went on to this Creek that I've found in practice that I was pretty sure I'll be able to get a lemon in and watch them.  About as I was leaving pull up on it and they can to stay long and 15 minutes probably took me that long to get out there and they were gone by the time I got to where I wanted to fish. So I pull back in that Creek and started throwing a white spinnerbait and I caught a 1414 of quarter 15 and a half and a 16 and a half on about 40 minutes or so, and I was able to as soon as I got my my limit I turned around and left and headed straight back to that road bed and it was my best chance of  Cole and I was able to catch a 21 and a half and a 17 in the last hour and a half just sit sit on that road bed and pulled out those 14 s ended up with 89 three quarters for the day. Nice when they were they on bottom or we feel like they were suspended just out there were some big fish suspended that word just hammering shad and I could not get them to eat only ones. I get to eat with the ones on the bottom and yeah.  in there  when they're suspending like that just above man. It's so hard to Target those fish. Yeah, when that wind picked up at the end of the day on day two. I was pretty sure I was gonna be able to call because that's usually when they started sucking down the bottom for whatever reason then so that helped a lot and kind of got those fish down there on the bottom more active when that wind started blowing. Yeah. I was on a similar situation to situation at our Club Championship this weekend almost the a exact scenario, so  It sounds like day two is a little bit tougher than day one. Oh, yeah, that's the stuff it was that way for everybody else.  I figured it would be tougher because just because I'll hard the lake got hit up on day one. It's not a huge Lake and I mean even those boats I was pretty surprised Wednesday when I slept in that ramp and I woke up and there were had to be 20 Boat Trailers there in the parking lot by the time I woke up. I was like Wow and I was like, it's a brother and they were just beating the bank's all which is another reason why I decided deep. Yeah.  And I need to learn how to sit still surprising.  It's still surprising. You didn't have some company out there. But yeah, I was really surprised. What are they out on the points at all dragging the points or where they all dead right on the barrel. There was one point in particular that I'd Mark some fish on and there was a boat on it. Every time I went by both days. Yeah. Yeah, but yeah, there's one that first day when I was catching on pretty good. I had a bunch of boats around me on both sides and  At one point, there's two on one side two on the other and I started looking and none of them were fishing. They were just watching me trying to figure out what I was doing out there think they're looking at each other with walkie-talkies. I think what else this guy's is kayak doing out here. He's crushing on always makes me happy. Yeah, so why are out there managed only big swimbaits know?  No, it didn't I thought about it. I threw a little bit of a smaller one a little bit, but I can hang with it and that water is a little dirtier than I like throw swimbaits in any way so I wasn't pretty dirty. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. It's a rain early on just before the tournament, right? Yeah, I think so.  Yeah, well in the wintertime man, that's that's where I learned to swim Bait fish. Oh, yeah there yeah throwing big big swing base and then fig guilds to like, you know, Matt lures and stuff like that. It's pretty nice pretty sick on the on the warm water side in the winter time. Yeah, but some Glide Bates might be fun out there, too.  Yeah, they might work. There's there's some donkeys in that like yeah for all the listeners that aren't watching this video man. Sam's over here like to shut up now. There's not too many Secrets out there. Well, they won't be after this. Anyway, it's all good man without that 21 and a quarter.  I bet that thing was 8 pounds. If it wasn't it was close to it. It was yeah so fat. I mean there's so much Shannon that laughs that's crazy. Oh, yeah the bait in that lake or just huge, you know, so they're feeding on just huge baitfish. So even even the white bass or massive in there. Yeah. Yeah.  And then they have a full Year's worth of growing season 2 on the waters. All right, you know rights. And so yeah, you're getting that that Alabama, Florida Georgia, you know, South Carolina North Carolina type growing season and the Heart of the Midwest it's just and then they've managed it really really well. Yeah.  That's real interesting and I've never been out to that lake. So I'm I'm kind of like my mind's kind of blown a little bit just like well, there's a lot of warm water lakes out there. But this one in particular just to set up perfectly to just breed big bass. Yeah. I bought a year license. Nah, I'll be back over there. Yeah, sounds good. Well, hey January 1st if anybody wants to meet up  The weather's not awful. I'm down. Yeah, tell me about there.  I think we should have a powder right you dope out there meet up at Berea had some good. Yeah. Well Brian's is quite a ways away. So all this yeah. Yeah, he's probably crying for hours and maybe because you know, he's Northern Illinois and this is this is east-central. I mean, yeah, so he's probably a little ways away but there's there's some cool places to stay out there. So yeah, I'm only four hours away here in Cincinnati. So yeah. Yeah, it seems like it's further than that. That's crazy.  Right. I was pretty surprised if some like 6 hours from Chicago.  Yeah, I'm 5 gotcha. Well, that's cool. So I guess we can get a little bit back in the day to since we kind of missed a few things. But did you notice like the pattern change it all from day one?  It definitely got tougher. But then I Spent A Little More Time On Day 2 in the morning.  Going for those shallow fish just the field on that top water. Yeah, just yeah because I didn't have time to stress out and I didn't really work out. I was pretty stressed all day. Yeah. That was another question. Can I ask you how you're feeling today one, but we kind of skipped over it. Yeah. Yeah, Ivo pretty good after day one, but I mean I knew how tough it was out there. And yeah, so I knew I was gonna have to grind to get it. That's why I was hoping  Pull maybe one good one up Shallow, maybe feel a little better you kind of was hoping but I didn't really grow up go that way but his work out anyway.  So that of those backup plans? Yeah. Oh, yeah. Those are important. Yeah, it's always first priority you get your limit before anything else. Mmm. I think I asked you your limit or how quick you had your limit on your second day. It took you all day right all day. All right. Yeah. Okay. So yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you were pretty stressed. I'd imagine and then  Heck you probably had a lot of time to sit there and think about the leaderboards and watch them to while you're fishing stuff. I'd imagine no we didn't have leaderboards for this one. It was we brought our right that's what to the ramp and the first day. We had to go. We had to check in over the was a place called cabin.  Some little Islands by right the cabin and so we just brought her pictures and and did it all there. So I didn't really know where I was outside of when I got to the ramp. I saw Dusty a cure there and it's like it's doing a good he's like, I'm not really good for this Lake and I was like, all right, then Todd. I talked to him on the phone. He knew talk Patrick knew that I had gotten pretty certain. He had said something about me having 94 and Dusty turns around goes you at 94 inches. I was like 95  And he was like damn it. That's cool. Yeah, I did forget that you guys did your check-ins and measuring at the at the ramp, but I think Brian was the one saying that you you almost ran out of time getting back on because that right. I stayed to the end so we had to  To fill three to fish and then we had I think to lose it 3:45 to get back to the ramp. So II started going and I was pedaling as hard as I could but I'd use my torpedo a lot more that second day, so I didn't have a full battery. So I ran at full blast halfway back pedaling as hard as I could and then brought it back to halfway, so I didn't run out at all and went  Helen was hard as I could the rest away and I made it back with six minutes to go. Ooh. Yeah, my torpedo battery was on the 0 when I got to the ramp, but it was still running. That's crazy. Yeah, what's your top speed with the motor full blast and pedaling as hard as you can man's probably  Five and a half maybe close to Six. That's all you know be man. Yeah. Yeah. And you said yeah. Yeah, that's pretty good.  Today gold bars pretty fast especially loaded down the way I have it. Oh God. Just getting ready to say that the big batteries and fifty pounds of soft Plastics and all kinds of stuff on the thing. 712 rods. Yeah, heck. Yeah.  I only only carry for with me but I can't you know, I can't afford that many of them. I can't help it. Oh, yeah, I was saying people people say they know that bass fishing changes day to day but the changes hour to hour, you know, I mean, you just never know what you're going to have to throw so I like care of them with me and I don't like have to cut and retie if I can avoid it, you know, so.  Yeah, I was way more time. Sometimes you just have to you. All right, so we're going to get into some other stuff here. Just so people can get to know you a little bit better. Is there somebody in the field of these tournaments that you're always looking for like like arrival, I guess type. I mean, yeah, who's your Rivals? Oh, man.  Yeah, Christine Fisher's one. We're always up there together kind of switch back and forth Cody Melton's another one Josh Stewart as another one. Those guys are always up there. And if you throw tournament you could bet they're gonna catch himself. Yeah. They're they're the ones I'm always looking for it. Did you have these you just did you name off the Hobie team for 2020 just now helmets are for Cody if he can one want I'll be come with us.  Yeah, I think that's in his backyard. So I think that's the player though, right? Yeah, isn't that yeah that the strategy right now. I don't think so. Cody gets forth a lot. He's really consistent. So, you know me Josh and Christine decided that we'll just go one two, three, Cody could have forums bottle roll down to him. There you go. That's who's buying drinks in that scenario afterwards is that  Career. Oh, yeah, that's well, I guess it depends who takes first. Did you hear that? Did you have your eye on anybody in this Crossroads? Classic somebody that you wanted to be?  Not really. No. No, I mean I heard about some guys that were good on the lake Patrick putti Tharp already is really good. So it was you know, Dusty accurate hers fish a lot stuff like that. So cool. And if I beat those guys, I probably had a good tournament. Anyway, yeah, right.  So what was it like lodging with all these other guys from all these different trails?  That was a lot of fun. I had a really good time. They some of the Wisconsin guys brought down some spotted cow. Oh, yeah, I've heard of that stuff. Yeah of when I was up in the cross the last couple of couple times last year. I got to know that beer. It's really good. We'll talk about it. I've never had it but for a lot of people talk about it to find out  Baker talking to sleep. I'm not fishing actually built this he reveal all his Secrets or eyes and a mouth obviously, but I don't know. I just know he's talking he woke up the guy who was staying and on the couch too. It's like what is going on? Yeah. Hey, you know, so I don't know for sure but  I think I think Oktoberfest might be going on up in Lacrosse week were there really I think I'm not sure if it could be I think it is. I think it is odd to check but they have a big Oktoberfest up there in the city of La Crosse every year. I feel like every time I've been there it was Oktoberfest. Well, I mean so for for people that don't know much about lacrosse it is a like Bruce city. That is I mean, that's what it is.  On for is all the microbrews there. So but you know, it also depends on who you're hanging out with, you know, so you can have Oktoberfest any time of year if you really want so all right. Well Society has the biggest Oktoberfest outside of Germany actually, so I'm pretty familiar with it. Okay. I didn't know that that's good to know. When when is that? When does that go down?  October yeah, yeah. I'm not even sure. I've been out of town a lot lately and start drinking on October 1st. And you know, see how long I can so do you have some kind of preparation or mental preparation you do for these tournaments?  I try to put my time in with my maps. That's one thing not try not to take it too. Seriously because when I just I get really stressed out I fish poorly when I do that, so I've found I just try to relax, you know things seem to go a little better the first couple years. I did it. I was real strict I'd wake up at the crack of dawn every day in practice and you know all that type of stuff and  She's not the way understand really work for me. So, you know, I just got to stressed out. So once I started relaxing and taking a little easier I started doing better. It seems like it's the that's a common theme with everybody we've talked to they're always like yeah, I just need to chill out. Yeah. It really helps them. Yeah. Yeah sleep in a little bit to on probably sleeping more one of the guys who really doesn't is Cody Melanie gets up.  The crack of dawn every day and he's out there. Maybe I'll sleep in I figure if I could figure them out later those morning fish will be there. Yeah, like started catch them when that sun gets up. Yep. That's true.  So I all right. We have a lot of listeners here at paddle and fin lot of new kayak listeners and I like to like  get a lot get information out there for them to learn I guess and I'd like for you to run through your routine of submitting a fish to the leaderboard, okay?  Well first I got to catch the fish after that. I'll lay them down in the in the bottom of the PA. So it doesn't really work for a lot of other kayaks because the PA has so much, you know floor space compared to a lot of them, but I lay it flat in there get the picture just to make sure I have something you know, oh just if it jumps off the board, you know, then then I've got something out of them then I'll lay  Flat my lap on the board and I'll take the picture that way get the you know from the tail trying to get as much as I can out of them.  and then I'll take  usually five to fifty pictures of the fish. They can best one. I'll fix the best picture and I'll put a little little heart favorites favorite it on the iPhone. So what I have a little hard on there and then I'll I usually open a new folder and I'll I'll style and then I'll after I take the picture of the fish and I'm done. I'll do one two, three with my fingers once I catch over five then I turn around.  Throw with my thumb and go the other way so I can tell him this, you know separation between fish. Yeah, it's a good idea then then at the end of the day, I'll go through off news of my favorites and I have all the best pictures for each fish in there. I'll move them to a new folder and I'll well I'll just go through pick out my top five and I'll move them to new folder and that I got them there to submit right? Yeah. See you don't submit right away. You wait till the very end of the day. It depends on how the what kind of fishings go. I'm  Doing if I've got time if I'm fishing slower especially deep sometimes I'll submit fish. Yeah as I go. If if it's something I feel like I could cast right back in there and catch another one or whatever then I'll try to get it done as quick as I can and you know, we're worried about submitting them to later but it's not like Sting. Yeah, I've been accused of sandbagging a lot lately, but I never really used to do that. It was just just kind of the way it's worked out lately. Yeah, I wouldn't worry too much about this.  Those guys saying that man it's all good part of the game. Yeah.  So what's your plans for the rest of the year? I got two tournaments left going to the cross for the kbf championship and that I've got the Tournament of Champions down and watch it. Aah. Oh, yeah, I forgot about that and I cool got man. That's the stack feel too. Oh, yeah the Champions. It's real unreal. Really? Yeah. It's basically a national championship want to look like a smaller scale.  So yeah, there's really has its they took all the winners from the satellites and the top six from every open and then turn out to be stacked field. It's going to be a very tough tournament to win anybody ones. That is gonna earn it. Yeah. Now one's going to be real fun to watch and recap. Yeah. It's gonna be it's gonna be interesting. Yeah. So play it plans for next year. What do you got? What do you got to focus on?  I really like the Hobie schedule actually myo is actually who I was representing at noon Lake from the crossroads and they have pretty good schedule to summon try to hit some of those and I'm gonna go through and kind of pick and choose some KBS I think and look at the pro series and stuff. Try to work out a my schedule try to have a little bit of everything. It looks like the bringing Border City Classic back on Lake st. Clair. So I'm gonna try to make sure I'm up there for that.  Nice can't miss it. Right. It's like letters been too good to me. I can't be missing any tournaments up there. Yeah, I think I remember her here in another interview with you. You started Muskie fishing in the middle of a tournament or something. All right. Yeah blows the it was in practice. But yeah, okay. Yeah. I had them out. Um dialed in pretty good. So Christine is a Big Muskie fisherman. She's talking about going I was like, let's go. I'm ready. She's like, well, you know, nobody catches on the  Timeout I'm like, let's go. It's all right, once we get out there and I think hit like a ton of bricks, but I didn't have a Musky that so I got them in my yak attack.  That and it's you know Tails hanging out. I'm just holding both sides of it. Like Cuisine was like are you serious? It was good time and some fun and then everyone ended up going I want to and that tournament to after yep. Obviously, we're pretty comfortable with what we're on. Yep. I remember we captain that one. I was pretty impressed with that was fun. Yeah. Well  Cool man on fire this year. Yeah. She is. Yeah. It's impressive. There's like I mean, geez, he's always someone that was in the conversation anyway, but now it's like yeah, she's an amazing year. You just expect that. She's gonna be there. Yeah. Yeah. She's tough to beat.  Oh cool. I think that's all we have tonight. Let's have said no man, you don't already follow you feel free to shout out your socials and hit up any sponsors and want to thank or anything like that.  Yeah, yak attack would be one tell you that that Landing that's been amazing for me if it's a what if I don't have that didn't float. I wouldn't happen that most of the time because I've dropped that thing in the water Ohad specially landed fish, you know when you get get those fish going coming in and they turn around and just dive back down. You got to let go of that net and try to bring them back in so I don't have to worry about a thing, sir.  In the bottom, that's a big help. Yeah fishing on lines another good sponsor mine and they've got a new line of tungsten out. That's really cheap and I've been using all year. So it's not actually cheap. It's just the cheapest honks and I've seen yeah, you know, it's not cheap stuff. So it works really well and angler is another one there the they have an app where you had a waypoint and you can it'll show up on the a  app so you can track your whole day. It'll give you some extra information barometric pressure and stuff for when you catch a fish calcoast mix a lot of good stuff donkey Lucia use a lot their battle box is awesome.  Lawrence is another one that Elite 9 is awesome. I've got the live transducer yet, but it's it's pretty sweet. Yeah, I'm looking to upgrade to that. I got the hook to right now, but I want to go to the Elite 9 for next year. All right. Yeah, it's it's a huge step up. Its the biggest difference for that is the sides game clown minutes. Yeah. I didn't even like using the side scan on my ti to be honest.  But yeah, it's night and day difference with this and always run a point one with it. If you know, I don't know if anybody listen in uses the ranch and doesn't have a point one at the big mistake, especially if you're trying to fish deeper stuff because you know exactly where that way point is makes a big difference. So yeah the bomb anchors just got on with them. They got they make a pretty cool. Anchor be worth going checking out if you're looking to put an anchor on your kayak.  Yeah, cool new product there for sure. All right and Torpedoes been pretty good to me. That's that's changes the game and change the way I pre fish, especially more than anything, you know, a lot of tournaments. I fish I'm not allowed to use it but I can still use it in free fishing and I could hit a lot more spots and do a lot more with that thing. So absolutely that's about it.  Anywhere where people can follow you on a social media. Yeah that you can follow me as Siddiqui fishing on Instagram. And if you just look me up Eric Siddiqui, I'm on YouTube. Also. I've got a few videos on there and I've got a lot of videos on kayak Bass Fishing their YouTube page. So awesome. Yeah, sweet man.

spotify:episode:2UIJLOWCqbEDv3tCeQkTec	Hello, this is your everyday positivity. My name is Kate kocher here on Vale. How satisfied are you with your work? I was speaking to a friend the other day and she was telling me a great story about how she'd just got really dissatisfied with work about two three years ago. And she was Borg said it was a challenging her. She just wasn't enjoying herself and then a new boss came in and she went to the new boss and she said look.  I'm not satisfied. Here's some ideas of how I can think we can make what we're doing better. There's there's a need for this because at that point the company decided to kind of go, you know what this department isn't really functioning. Maybe we need to think about how we get rid of this department. Let's look at some redundancies. So she went to her bosses said look, this is the situation. This is how I think it could be better now two years on this week. She got a promotion and she is now a senior management level. So she went from completely dissatisfied say scoring a 3 out of 10.  In terms of satisfaction with her work to a 10 out of 10 now because she took action because she recognized that she was not happy and she made it something that maybe she made it something that she could change. So today I know, you know, we've been working through this every day positivity. We love life looking at the segments of your life and where you're up to right now in terms of okay, where am I right now?

And if you could put a score out of 10 where 10 is really satisfied and three or four one is completely dissatisfied. Where do you sit on that scale? And is it something that you go all I could do something about that or is it something where you go? Oh, I'm just going really high. I wonder what it is that's working for me right now and have a real think about it. I love doing this level of review and I'm really glad that you're sharing this time with me for you to get a wheel of life if you haven't got one.

I was speaking to a friend the other day and she was telling me a great story about how she went from being completely dissatisfied with work to being a 10 out of 10 in terms of satisfaction with her work.  She recognised that she wasn t enjoying her work and took action to make it better.
spotify:episode:4ypiwpHS1TMU6IrTGmgqpn	All right, everyone. Welcome to a new year with the MMO s.com podcast Episode 205 and I'll die here. Join this year by Remo and there it is this year all time 20 20 20 20 and there are still no good and most apply. Uh still well, here's the question.  Or will this be a clear year for a more fiji's 20/20 vision? Listen, hahaha. So we did there with 20/20. I do think there's more hope this year than other years. I didn't wanna jump pretty quickly to our game of the year section because we did mention a few upcoming is ripe for and what was good this last year what not, but I think everybody's over and my friend mentioned something to me and it kind of made me think we feel really old and we're talking to pregame about getting old and we're not that old. You know you 31 I'm 30 and my buddy. He's a he's 30 as well. He mentioned I do you think  We're going to be like top 1% in a game again unlimited think know who feels bad. Like it's like I was really good at League. I was really good at Starcraft 2. I was really good like and a lot of games I did even though to back when I first met I would say they cannot stop bumper setback never did it to maybe like top to 3% But nowadays it's the last game. I was top one percent at was probably still League of Legends. It's kind of hard to kind of combine and moves into it because like, yeah, you can find like you're a raid parses you could 99.  Parsons certain fights, but like if you're not like if you're not that person everything I guess I would consider the top one percent but Emma was a kind of like a different beast and you really just optimizing at that point. I think it's look at 99 in 2014, but that's not really a good Benchmark. So to me I do see it kind of difficult kind of visualize myself being top one percent and like any competitive game again, you know, I feel like we're getting old or a reflex or dying. I think we're getting all definitely but as I think there's a bigger Trend to and that's a trend of the scope of the gaming industry. Like like when we were growing up right ten eleven twelve how many  It's where they're playing even like DOTA 1 even like Smash Brothers Melee at that time. Nobody like very few because especially competitively because the logistics weren't there and even there was a million globally right now would like Fortnight. There's like a hundred million people playing for a night. So to beat 1% of her night, you got to like crazy with your you know, with the building, you know, like even even like we think about like when were playing SNES, you know growing up. Well, there's Mega Man X or knockout country compared Donkey Kong Country or thigh or Mega Man X right on the SNES. So any like new age Nintendo switch like  Mario Kart switch or the game literally plays itself for you. I did like Mario Karts which has a default autopilot mode on where you can hold a and you close your eyes, you will go through the entire stage successful. Okay, you couldn't do that back in like any old school SNES game these games were more hardcore. So I guess if you are able to play Donkey Kong Country or Mega Man X. You were like probably top one percent by today's standard. So if you look at it that way I think gave me was just a smaller Niche so because the thing because well, here's the thing. Here's some problematic.  To your buggy keeping right the the difficulty of games itself was gatekeeping, right? If you're afraid of your family bought you one of these Platformers when you were like 10, and you couldn't beat the first level you probably got turned off from gaming, you know.  But is it possible that I could probably still be top? 1% a game like TFT or you know, though down the Lord stuff like that because that's more game knowledge where reflexes aren't as important the way there are some your maybe people will be hard times like that. Do I feel like I've never really been committed to Hearthstone already ccg. I played a lot of Shadow verse and hurt somebody and not enough to like really, you know be good at those games, you know, but I think we have three capture that sense of competition locally. One of the great things about those older style games like where  Fighting games arcade or like early councils is you don't have to be the best in the world. If you were just kind of competing with your own like your own school grade, right or like, you know friend group that was enough for a sense of competition a sense of success as a sense of like a pecking order. So I think hopefully I kind of I kind of wanted to go more in that direction rather than just trying to compete with some kids in China who play 18 hours a day, you know, but do you think like the current like trend of matchmaking and online games have I kind of made kids like lose self-esteem?  Like there was always a kid was like, oh, yeah. I'm the best. I've never lost a game of like Mortal Kombat. I've never lost a game of like Smash Brothers and like at that point back then like there was no online play for these games. You just played locally and he that kids probably not lying. So he was in his mind. He was a really good right? He might if I was like the best ever right, but because there was no online play too kind of like smoosh you and let you realize how shitty you actually are like people felt good about themselves, but now with online play nobody feels good about themselves. Everybody knows there's somebody better than that like every knows there's always somebody better than them.  But back, then you could pretend like you're I am undefeated. I play Bowser. I don't know how to do anything in melee by be all my friends with suck and we put it items only that's how we that's how we rolled it. But that's a good point ever thought of that. But so I think I really do matchmaking is an engine for frustration. But yes, that's interesting is you point even if you were not good there was literally the case that in your friend group, you would win ninety percent of matches, right? You still lose some but 90% that you would win but online if you match making everybody wouldn't exactly 50.1% recognize you  Better it puts your gets better people so you can never win more than 50% of your games. So you never get to feel like you're achieved anything because you never get to feel like okay, I'm good. I can relax because it's always it's always a Razors Edge your next match making match. That's a good point. Maybe that's why life will get you know, pretty toxic on games. Like we can know that we're because you're always winning like about 50% and I feel like you kind of know that it's designed that way but then it makes it makes the law streak feel exceptionally bad. Well, if you lose like six games in a row and you oh my God, I felt so far I was supposed to  50% but I didn't am I horrible what's going on? Let's try teammates if those guys you know, like if it does create engine of frustration and interesting way it's obviously unattended mechanic, but I still think it's still a net positive I think because it has to be that positive. Otherwise every game company in the world wouldn't do it. Just easier to make a game online than the coop. You know, I think nobody's cracked the code of making Co-op a local local competitive popular, you know, there's a few companies we talked about in the past like Super League Gaming and stuff trying to organize small local tournaments for certain game.  Eames I know even the local Dave and Buster's clone. What's it called game shops only the trying to do like local Esports tournaments. Mmm, but somehow somehow they haven't really caught the Zeitgeist. It's true. Everything is kind of defaults to like this matchmaking. Now, you know, you always competing against people online though. I would say Nintendo still kind of has that like that couch gaming feel of other titles only because Nintendo online just tends to suck ass, you know, not by like I'm sure they wanted to go messing around and they do have matchmaking smash, but just all line is always frustrating with end of titles.  And play with your friends online is frustrating to because of the friend codes, but just until I get hot mess playing online in general so that came they came still gets a lot of catch boy. I'm curious if anyone has had has had this experience where what? I feel like when I'm climbing matchmaking. It's always adrenaline never dopamine. Yeah, but if I'm playing like smash I get invited to someone's house with eight people they all take to basically it's me facing them one by one and I keep winning but it easy. It's fun for them where there's looting stomped every game. Well, here's the thing though. At least I'm having fun in the matchmaking.  He's having fun. Everyone is an adrenaline everyone on adrenaline 2014 the whole match and if they win it's because it was this close and then the next match they try they have to be focused again, it's always a Razors Edge. It's never like a stomp. So I don't know other did you do any proposed solutions for the matchmaking conundrum? Like it just seemed like that is mathematically speaking matchmaking solves a problem with like different skill balances and does a mathematically good job of doing that by giving you 50 50 games which like you said though. They do end up being a on the razor's Edge and they become all adrenaline.  Stressful no chance to relax. This could be a test at a big company like Rekha do make it so one out of like 50 Games 1 or 20 games.  One person the match is vastly over class to everyone else but the deep but the game is to tell you this so that was stopped. He got to stop that game and he so at least and then they measure this so he is now his dopamine whereas everyone has adrenaline, but you kind of naturally get that don't you apply from just like having enough 50 50 games for one guy gets ahead. He Stomps. Anyway, I tell you we kind of kept that on and automatically know but most won't make it like I'm you know is what what the result would be if they just put you in our like in a playpen with kids and just get to smash them how well the do for your you know, desire to keep  The game will make up front 20 bad games. You had another promise those other nine guys. I have a horrible experience getting awful stomp or Five Guys on your team of four more asymmetrical games. So this could not happen only would you have to be a new game but you know things like was again called the one with the one guy's a monster and for people at survivors, it's big on the five days to die for days to die. Yeah, and we talked about forgot to name the dead by daylight then ideally dead by daylight so dead by day like  Do you have an asymmetrical game where people get to take to evolve is also known as a similar one where you know one guy got to be overpowered compared to anyone another guy's gotta like in a work together to overpower. So at least everyone gets a feeling of power and the feeling of you know, helplessness and it kind of rotates. Maybe that's what gunbound was trying to figure out when you played random and you got the nose. Remember this come about example could only place combined anymore or everybody remembers it but we played random and gunbound you get a random character and like there was 200 P characters. You can only get by random a very low chance you get dragon of he got a night or something.  Good night, if you got either those get a huge Advantage, so I guess it kind of play with that idea. We random chance to be happy.  Actually, you know MMOs are uniquely situated to bring it back to the most. Thank you Durfee, but I think I'm RPGs are uniquely situated to test these asymmetrical Power Systems where you could have like the top player, you know be a lot of old Korean gives it this where what top player could be like the king and he could control a giant Avatar but then everyone else has a mob or something, you know, so they could be a lot of ways to play with it. And I think in the end it will slowly have to do this after people can kind of get tired at this, you know, 50% grind matchmaking stuff, but that's the thing about no mo.  Versus more like Competitive Gaming right thing and most of the sweet spot where it's not like a matchmaking South Competitive Gaming where instead it is very asymmetrical accelerated in some team comps some raids. If you blink a pug group in ff14 or wow, for example, you will get certain players at carry other players and like you do feel good when you care other players, you always feel good. Like you looking your damage charge these scrubs hitting like 6K damage on a black mage. I'm eating like 12 can't come on. This guy really knows how to play. I'm going to carry him and you feel good being the bad ass, you know, yeah, so he's eating Hotel.  A to make everyone everywhere has have a chance to feel like the bad ass once in a while. Hmm But that's the thing it beauty of him was it they're not competitive in the same way, you know League kind of strike don't know what not are so if you like you could still kind of achieve this through other, you know other avenues in MMOs.  Yeah, it's all about this before but a few games achieve this by accident. So games like Counter-Strike with this crazy headshot. Mechanic Right One In A Hundred matches. You'll have the bad player just basically spray walk forward and kill the whole team, you know, like the whole enemy team just off five spreadsheet that and a guy feels great for the next, you know, 50 rounds of losing that's what the argument that the orangey of like the spray patterns and being generally unpredictable makes those mechanisms possible. You could have like a five best csgo players and one like awful.  Just one in a billion games the one-off a player could could theoretically Ace the five best. Yes, go players. Yes players in the world by literally closing his eyes and just mashing the soup on do you get absolutely lucky but that can never happen in a game like chess or any game without RNG. It's a little bit would never happen on this guy. Just throws game attention Okay, so is it isn't it? Maybe was course we can tackle next time. I'm gonna think about it. How many people playing league right or Dota or Counter-Strike are going into it with the chest mindset versus the play mindset so I know you are.  The more competitive and player when you qu for for League you viewed as a basically a chess match like in terms of like I play whatever game you play to win, right? Whereas I think a lot of people the majority of people play to play like they just knocking things down killing stuff you're trying new moves or you know, just do shit in the game at that's fun for them right with the oh no with winning being preferable obviously, but it's not being the dolia matters.  I think for most of the playing ranked and people are very rank stresses of real thing. I it just seems like most people are going into it just to win games. It's about going into it just to win games you'd be playing, you know normal motor on Ray.  All right. Well, yeah, I'm curious about that. Hmm. Did you want you want to talk about that League AFK thing? I want to hit our game of the year thing. That's it. Lets it the game of the year award first. Alright, it's a beginning of 2020 the most highly watched Game of the Year Awards in the world. Alright, I am most.com. All right, there was a bidding war for the Game of the Year this year. Okay, we had we had a blizzard. We had Square Enix just begging to give us money to make them number one, which obviously I'm kidding they weren't but while classic took the number one shot over here, and I don't think  It could be underestimated how big of a game like classic is. Yeah, and honestly, I'm kind of relieved that while classic came out this year because the rest of the field like member we only give our game of the year two games that came out this year. It's not improve games, you know, just this year. So the competition was very very sparse here Estella online a few, you know, no name and where he I feel I would feel dirty giving it to us Talia like you win by default because they're like, no other game is launched in 2019, like no other PC and more peaches really  launched in 2019. So it I would feel dirty even to study. So even though wow classic is kind of a relaunch it squeak by we gave it to them. Yeah, and what surprised me was how big the launch was so all right over there if they won and we had all the same problems you have in a huge new launch, you know in the past where they had opened more service and they thought they were 12 our cues to get in. You know, those 12 are cues lesser like a month. All right. It's like you always had to stay logged in if you want to keep playing.  They give free transfers to new servers. But if you want to plan your initial Choice there was there were queues for you know weeks remember the server's launched initially which only called charting which is multiple copies of the whole world in each server and they call they collapse those now they're gone now, so there's only one instance of the world each thing, but they clearly were ready for a big influx and they got an even bigger one than expected. So it shows you that people well classic is on a meme. It's still going still big. I see a lot of people still playing and yeah and Beyond  The numbers I just recap the quick numbers real quick on the fund and Activision Blizzard earnings report. They clarified that with the launch of our classic. Wow, had the single biggest increase in quarterly users and subscribers in the game's history the law joão classic increase subscribers more than any other quarter in the game's history. So they've added millions of subscribers because of our Classics launched that that was a huge boost the game's popularity and besides the actual data all that have some anecdotal evidence is just fun story as well. You know, when the game launched when my buddies quit his job  Basically pretty well class of all that he prepared. He quit his job is ready to go the moment the game launched. He never stopped blank. I asked for his / playtime. He's got like four level 6. He's now three or four levels sixties and he's been you know rating hardcore video. Obviously one of them. I think the game watched it was it like September 1st or they August right? Yeah, and he basically has like if the case went out for like 70 days, he has like 45 days of in gameplay time, like literally non-stop playing since the game launched and my other buddy who's playing with him I play with him as well for a bit. He was jealous because he had a he had a job.  Right, and he was like since wow classic launch team made a commitment. I am going to get fired from my job so I can play with class called a because if he gets fired he clicks on employee benefits if he quits on his own, he doesn't get unemployment benefits. So he was trying to get fired for like months right and and they just wouldn't fire him. So he just got so mad and just quit it. You know what Battlegrounds came out? I don't want to get fired anymore. It's taking too long. They won't fire me these guys suck and he quit his job when Bee Gees came out for while classic so he forfeit his unemployment benefit just to play while class right he was  Trying to get fired you're begging to get fires. Are you play? Well all day but now his wish was granted. He quit his own job. So you think it's benefits by he's playing well classic all day and every day so it's a remarkable. It is insanity, but it shows you the power of World of Warcraft and how how addictive a truly good game can be I think honestly, I'm jealous. I'm envious of my two friends are playing more classy this much because it's been a while since I've had this hit where like I have to be like being able to sit down in front of PC if my computer  Her and just play a game and not realizing 12 hours have passed. I miss that feeling fortunately for me. I think I've had you know more recently than you with various tiers of how bad he's working. Ray's coming out. I do get the like brief brief periods where I'll play like literally 16 hours a day and that realize 16 hours passed and it's a great feeling for some reason but it only lasts for me like about a week or two weeks before, you know, clear the content. I move on but that I miss that feeling and David having that feeling for months at a time. Obviously. I should have missed it. But I know there's a guy down the street called scats. Whoo.  Some heroin. Okay. It'll try it'll give you right where you want right Honestly though. It is giguere addressed. I still get that feeling. There you go. It probably it don't think it's unfair to compare it like a drug it because it really is an interesting feeling where you can just literally play 16 hours. It's so amazing. Like I kind of look back at it. It really does feel like I was probably like on drugs or something because that that feeling of just like being so immersed in what I'm doing right where I'm forgetting to  I eat well eat nothing all day. And before I go to sleep. I eat like I like seven Uncrustables or like like five Hot Pockets, right? That'll be my my dinner just like get sustenance for the next day. But it's it is it is a remarkable feeling and while classic is is firing on all Pistons. I think I had the Dave add a new service and players, you know, the Q times are gone. So if you want to play it's still Mega popular and you know, it's still doing really well. If you if you haven't even if you like it back into our classic, you know World of Warcraft others. It's a good time to do. So, I think wow classic success and the success of other progression servers MapleStory. I'm  On guys MapleStory pre-big Bang official server is going to launch this year. That's my guess. They've already done experiments with you know, the lab servers. I think when you get a pre-big bang MapleStory server this year speaking MapleStory. First of all, they got to fix the client. I mean that the class but shit for it is like a 70% chance when you launch people story. It just doesn't open you got to keep trying that is unacceptable. I don't know what's going on with that, but I actually got I mean a new character guys level 200 before the end of the year. It's like a little ritual I have I been  Basically make a new Burning character every holiday season and see how far I can get in like a week and every year it gets easier because it made the experience easier. So I did hit 200 my first 200 but doesn't mean the anymore because now the max is like 275. Hmm. But I was fun. I I still enjoyed playing MapleStory.  Let's move on to our game of the year list. We have our best expansion the year. I really not too many contenders even made it to this but we gave it that 14 Shadow Bringers. I think as I think a lot of websites already did as well. In fact that the IGN gave like the best continuing game if F-14 chatter brings as well and a lot of other I think Shadow brick is one of the highest rated Final Fantasy games period in the longest time and this is a 5 out of 10 or something. So it's pretty universally liked I played through story. We talked about being immersed in the game when I was reading it for 49 to get that 14 hour 15 hour.  Right, I do nothing but rate, right but whenever 14 shed Burgers came out, I'm playing MMORPG the more traditional sense where I'm just playing the game. I'm leveling up. I'm going through the story doing some dungeons. Like that was my experience had a brain is where I was playing non-stop. I beat the I faced the main story quests all the content Shadow Burns pretty much in the first the first week it came out. So I was playing all day for that first week and that was really fun as well. So I really enjoyed the game. I actually I've been trying to get Alta to play through Shadow broker just experience the story of an MMORPG. I do think it's the first expansion.  In the game with a really good story, you know, I thought was better than Heavens heavensward at those a lot better in the base game story and a lot better than the there's the storm blood story. So I actually really like the storytelling of Shadow Bringers. I'm just kind of afraid that they're going to take it to a really bad Direction the future but of the wait-and-see for that. I think that's one of the crowning achievements of Final Fantasy XIV that they combined a good rate system housing Guild of these trading, you know Marketplace these MMORPG fee social features.  They combine that with a traditional RPG sink basically single-player write the story basically single-player experience and it's and it's a pretty lengthy one. Right? Like how long does it take for my God human you character and growth in just just the main story quests 0 side quest. Let's say 1 the current expansion.  And at least 30 hours, that's a that's a full-size game right there. Pretty much. Yeah, and we're saying you ignore all the side quests and there are million sides. Well you do I say do do as you hit him like you don't go out of your way, but you just but still again every map is designed to give you a million sidequest like you can really like what I've worked. This really was they do tell you the lure of the world like through optional side-quests. You won't know a lot of like my new shh about the game. If you don't do the side quest, right? Those are just there if you really want to like get encyclopedia knowledge of like starting events in the game starring character in the game how things unfolded and you really get  That through the side quest but the main story quests like you said is basically single pair RPG. Yeah, and this game you have a fantasy has combined those two really well and they do it over and over again like every two years he spent in sell. Well, they grow the population keeps going up. So that's good. It's a healthy game. We're not going to get an extension this year, right? Because oh no, no, no. Yeah. So yeah, but uh, I think ff14 and ESO a really the only like big Western what ESO is Western developed. This is Japanese developed right here.  The only two big like and more pge's in the west along with World of Warcraft. Obviously, these three games are really the big the big three OS old school RuneScape think I've been running for a long time as well as also super popular but doesn't have like the same, you know main story quests the main like jrpg style storytelling as a game like we're big story time the way ESO or fancy 14 does and this is an all-time high in popularity, you know, 514 brings reported like the highest ever quarterly earnings for that mode division, which obviously compared to certain like mobile game is still not a lot of money, but we still have a few games still thriving.  In this environment where you know basically mobile games other like and mobas and battle royales are doing really well. We still have a handful of games being ff14 World of Warcraft old school RuneScape and ESO doing really well.  And as far as wow, the classic did really well this year, but I think the the retail expansion did not age. Well, I mean people were excited the first month quickly kind of became disaster. The population went down and I think we've mentioned that very it's very possible that wow subscribers to actually dipped below final fantasies for a bit. But obviously with the launch of classic. I think it's great hundred percent with Wow classic there there Mulder much higher than 14, but I think there was one point where and if  Think about how your number now that's move on to our most anticipated and this one is interesting because when I actually had a chance to play the alpha for tempt him just before the podcast. So most anticipated obviously it went to tempt him and this is after last year's going to Lost Ark so I think kind of lost our kind of dropped the ball because it came out with two years ago now in Korea and also all of them last year, it could have been out here too. But I think it just took too long and I've lost theme when other more viable products.  I've been introduced like tempt him isn't you know string us along the alphas out. Its playable Weaver and I both played it and it's it works like a charm. It's smooth the graphics look great. It's bright vibrant and does it does exactly what it says it's going to do is basically, you know Pokémon clone.  We've only played for about 30 minutes. Somebody asked is overrated. It's going to be launching with only like a handful of ten times in the game. So it's not gonna have like a crazy number of likes a crazy amount of content. They've already said that with the Early Access they can be launching with some pretty limited amount of content. So because of that like don't expect a full-blown, you know Pokemon MMO RPG just yet. But from what I've seen it more be really impressed. It runs really well. So the Early Access to gonna be locked with a 20-hour campaign with for boss. Tojo's which I guess would be like Jim's the game is Co-op.  That there'll be semi 610 times to catch obviously not nearly not my kind of Benchmark was with a hundred fifty-four there is a Pokemon but you know, that's just with the Early Access. This customization is breeding system. The shiny tempt mspb battles and play of the world Explorer, but they can be adding a lot more when the game comes out and fully launches. They expect over a hundred sixty-one 10 p.m. You know, there's a pick and ban drank PV system and this game I was so impressed already just just the fluidity of the game and I launched the game. I start walking around. I see other players walking around the persistent, you know world of tempt him.  In the actual battles themselves, they're really fluid and it's just a really it just feels good to play like a production value is there.  You know, there's a there's a there's an unquantifiable element when you launch a new game either keyboard and mouse are controller and you just move you just you just got look you live left, right you walk a little and you can tell right away if it's got that smoothness or not, you know so many like indie games or clunky games just you could tough in the first five seconds at okay. It's one of those games like it might be fun. But you know, I kind of feel weird moving but I 10 times is not like that. It feels smooth right off the bat.  So they go ahead and show this if the interesting thing when you make your character because in the Games character creator, you don't just pick a male or female the way you would do in any other a lot of other games. This is the first game I've seen where you just kind of chooses to male ish looking body or female is looking body and at the end instead of picking a gender you pick your pronoun. Yes, sir. I've never seen this before. I mean we kind of mean the batter for a while in the past, but this is the first time I'm seeing a guy so there's no mail jet in a female and once you're done with the character you can choose your  Oh now she heard he him they them now obviously, I think a lot of people going to get kind of like a knee-jerk reaction to like, oh my God, that's you dummies are ruining gaming but like I thought about it for a second like who and I realized who cares like it's is this really hurting anyone's experience of the game and my answer is no I'll thank you, so you think no and here's the thing though. I would prefer you don't pick a gender or pronoun. Just make a character. Like what do they need this part? Oh, that's a good point. Maybe just leave it with the body because like you can choose a body beginning with like kind of, you know, you got boobs hanging.  In out and then the broader shoulders is one the body types. So just choose a by type and then your product doesn't matter that and if you communicate yourself if you want in game going to choose your name, you know, like so if your name is Rima tables like hello remote a like what's up don't have to say hey him or hey, you know, like when would it come up and chat? I don't know add them. It is not a sponsor review. If we get paid to talk about any game we do this close it pretty openly we mentioned how much we get paid we talk about certain games, but I wish they paid me we do get a free copy of the game though. I've requested. It actually didn't give it to me. I know that.  When I want you got the offer, you know, give me that hook up bro. I got the Hook-Up. So yeah, we only play for like 30 minutes early on but I was really impressed with this already just because like we've seen so many Kickstarter games like kind of flop and nothing came out of them. But this game is already kind of delivering what they wanted. Like, I've seen the battles already it very much feels like a poke Innovation Wise It's that really Innovative. It just took Pokemon and made a freedom and more version of it. So I could be free to play a launch. It's a cost money, but I'm surprised it tend to drop the ball this long I can see all those carrots. We got Brock in the  and as I met Brock as my character seemed like a band, you're not gonna get been obviously. It's so funny to how much they copied the storybook him. I like it's not easy to copy the world like you kind of like you wake up in your mom's house and they go. Oh, you gotta talk to a professor. What's his name over there? You know, you're going to be leaving to become a Pokemon trainer or something and you leave your house you choose from one of three Pokémon. They always want to three and then you the Battle of in a battle your rival in this case. They're called Max. So like just just like the setup.  Is so identical to the Trope and that the basics of Pokemon, which are these okay, that's not a big deal. They copied that but I'm just surprised it Nintendo didn't do anything quite like this on their own. I think Nintendo is one of those companies that needs competition to act. So I'm hoping we get more competition. I know this game called War Groove. It's kind of like it's kind of like Advance Wars but like fantasy it was really well received. So hopefully they make another Advance Wars game now, we'll see but I think I think Nintendo needs more people to clone them just so they can kind of  Get off your lazy butt make you know better online games better quality games. My focal length sword and shield is they've Stick it to so much with that but they're not and I think tempted might give him the the heat they need to start working harder then see where Show gameplay video. I will talk a bit about a few of the differentiating things. I mean the games have player housing as well mention it launches which is which is pretty fun. But just the idea of like this persistent world Pokemon MMO where you battle other players and they can be adding pick and ban drank TP. I mean, this is gonna be a real Pokemon game in the beauty is  Do a few design decisions that put you on doesn't do so, I liked your unlike the other video, but first to show that just show the gameplay. I will talk about the game actually is no RNG. So from their design perspective, they wanted to design a Pokémon like game without the RNG if you've played Pokémon before you know, that RNG is clearly a pretty big part of the game. It kind of influences a lot of decision-making in Pokemon. I mean, whether its accuracy and stuff like that, I mean there's a there's no accuracy in a intense and violent your hit space canal and every single time. He hits take a while to charge up. So they've kind of  Solved the RNG mechanic by by adding a stamina mechanic the game. So if you want to use certain powerful abilities, you think it more stamina than other abilities, right and other abilities to use them. You cannot use extra tax at the beginning of a fight, you know, you have certain tasks available on the first turn and your second turn will start charging up and you only use after it's fully charged that point is charged with you can use it then and then start recharging up again and obviously more powerful text take longer to be able to use later in the fight as well as the require you to have use a more stamina if you use abilities, we add a stamina you take damage yourself, so  Database we try to design the game around a hundred based skill and strategy rather than RNG which Pokemon is notorious for I mean, you could just lose a game to crits in Pokemon and and missing attack. You know, how many times have you know, if you play Pokemon Showdown you get a 10% profit or you miss a 90% attack, you know stuff like that is was clearly something tempt them didn't want to have so it's not just purely casual game as well the designers by attentive clearly thought about making something more more skill-based which is interesting considering their look and feel the game looks very much like  on and looks very much like a casual game, but I think they're going for a pretty hardcore feel to them. They want to do is pick and ban rank system as well. So they're try to design their game around, you know, building a good team and making good good, you know try to predict your opponent's moves and whatnot. So if you're just in that they do talk about a bit of the design philosophy on there and there is no Kickstarter page. I'm trying their website as well.  Yeah, I mean, it looks great at anything. Like I said earlier is going to be a competitor ranked competitive matchmaking to another my matchmaking but like a rank system.  But it looks pretty intense again. I'll tell you I've only played red for the broadcast began. I think the alpha has just started last night as well as putting a chance to play it but I'm probably gonna play it later today as well and I'll folks funds in on Thursday. There's a few stress test from here until it the middle of the month and I think it should be coming on Early Access this month to yeah it decide this again that we put us, you know, most hyped games. That's actually coming out like this month last year again, we talked about Lost Ark and lost ark is still not out here in the west. My prediction is Lost Ark will launch in the west this year. That's my prediction.  All the other we can happen, but it's got to happen because if it doesn't happen this year that I was all gone. Is he like blade stall over again where people were so high for Blade and Soul, but the launch took forever.  Alright, so next moving on. Here we go hordes dot IO for most Innovative. So I have you seen this one. I've seen like I once again twitch play for like 10 minutes, but I didn't play it myself. I know you said you give it a try. Yeah. So this is It's online. So I don't knows IO sites just going to hold it out. I owe you can still make a character. There's two factions PVP open world PVP. It was Monsters levels. It's like a full feature MMORPG on any browser no download and it just works everything works. You can make parties you can you know, whatever it is drops is a PVE or just pee pee  Repeat npv. Okay. Yeah. So this is a team-based PVP and it works it works very good. And I think it's smart that they jumped on this IO Trend because these IO games are huge, you know, all the kids play them at school and under under the iPads or whatever so great. It's I think it was a very nice little gem and I think it's I think it's maybe like two people one artist when one coder so it's amazing. It's very impressive that IO games. I only have played that a bad IO game yet, whether it's you know a gar.  Our whether it's servio the put down the pub G like Battle Royale in the browser for there's hordes IO games it for whatever reason I've been very very good. So yeah, the guys are on a PC right now. You can just probably just check it out while you're watching maybe when people play it after the podcast and there's something to be said about just being able to launch a game and play it right away. You know, there's a buildup. Look when you play it up for Dean to begin, you know, quote playing ff14 because it's got that jrpg look and feel, you know, you're not really gonna be playing the game for at least an hour.  Okay between just like introduction, you know walking around town like killing your first enemy, you know, it's being an hour before that happened. So with hordes I owe you just jump right in. Yeah, so that was last year. We gave it to a again that shut down like within a week, you know, it was like what was it called? It was like the one where it was kind of like Realm of the Mad God, but when you die, you keep like some traits that you get well, yeah that that was actually really cool game. I forget the name of it to now. Yeah, it's dead though. It died like within like a month ago. What's funny is think two years ago that we give it to another game to shut down.  Already, that was the show that that year as well Masters, man. Yeah, so we gave them a strikes Master with shut down that year Survivor give it survived by which also shut down during that year and maybe I'll take maybe the curse of the mo is not kind of most Innovative award hordes that IO guys confirmed the shut down this year. All right, because what if we could have whatever we give our most Innovative game to just shuts down. Alright, well, we'll see.  Miracles it was a both those games. I think we're really really impressive in terms like their design features, right? I guess work commercially viable, but I think at least Master x master a lot of made a lot of weird mistakes and like who they were aiming to cater with that game. So I'm hopefully hordes IO doesn't make that mistake.  In the end best Battle Royale I can you believe it over that. Apex. Legends came out in 2019. I mean that one it just it is wins by default for that. Yeah. Well, I was a huge game. What else what else do we have in a couple of like me ones? Yeah some Duggars but Apec Legends kind of pulled off a pup G that in terms of it came out of nowhere, right? Like a peasant was like a total surprise to released by EA and respawn right? And it just it was huge. It just took off everyone was playing this game. It did slow down, you know a few months after launch, which is normal, but it's still a huge game qg sports team.  Going around it. It's fluid. It's fast. It's good. It's Council NPC. It works pop G kind of suffer from like lag and hackers and cheaters and disconnects. I feel like everyone's way smoother Than The Punchy is but it feels nicer if we talked about with temp temp. So if you play puppet you today even today it's going to As you move around its gonna be like buggy and laggy and like you're going to feel conquered but we play by students first time smooth. I'm not sure clunk heard is a word all that but I like the way you use it though, because I feel like the width  just sounds like you know, it is what it is Clunkers moving around and probably still doesn't feel does it feel right? You know what he launched publicly for the first time you invite a couple friends into your lobby. It seems like eats eggs appear in the background it just you just know it's not going to run. Well exactly. I wonder what the term is for this but there's some kind of unquantifiable feel like your games like smoothness Factor. Yeah, when you launch a game of the first time you run around you you get that right away. I knew from the get-go like the puppy was a fun game. I played a lot in beta if I  Played it more like before launch probably than after it launched. It was a fun game, but you're always fighting with just the way the game felt.  Policy was made for Windows 98. There you go.  So I think last year we gave best battle royal to ring of Elysium, which was actually a growing game at that year, but I think it says that has kind of fallen off on Steam charts. You think what? Yeah, let's see. Yeah, it's free to play written by Ten Cent. It gives you nice spyware in the computer. But you know at the cost of progress, let's see ring obviously see ya deadly fell off. I mean last year was peaking at 63 thousand players on Steam. I have since Fallen quite a bit average has 4,100.  Players now. Wow, it's it's Fallen quite a bit. Just huge fall. I think Apex allegedly took a lot of steam out of this one. Yeah, it looks like to launch in early 2018 that kind of correspond to that big fall off. That's crazy from 60,000 over 60,000 to now 2,000.  So it just went a bit with a new battle relegating with Aaron big income that they really isn't that much room for number three or four player, you know and Wrigley's and was like, you know could be the number three player potentially after after 49 plus G. Right, but now you have a text editor to the firmly took that number three spot.  Crazy don't make sense.  All right. So that's that's Battle Royal, you know better world. What do you think of the genre? I think we all pretty high hopes for that. We're going to see a whole bunch of flood of these games and we say I think we have more of a trickle like there was a few big games a lot of really do games but I think really in the middle I'm disappointed honestly, very disappointed with us till the genre has been I feel you could be way better. I remember reading remember when pumps you first came out. They said they want to get em for like more players in a single map. Yes. We're still a hundred players in Pub GI. Come on. I hope like was really cool about battle relative. Wow, there's a hundred players and we got to see  The last one standing why not two hundred players one of 300 players, like wait, why can't we do that? They'll be way more fun and intense just so much Upon Jesus spent like there's a balance between like running around picking up blue and fighting and I feel like when I'm playing pomp G so much time is spent not fighting. Yes, and if you just had more action, I think it's more fun and more rewarding if you with more than 100 players, I think most players prefer that as well.  We need a good Battle Royale. It's maybe not a shooter. You have a few companies have tried that as well. But nothing has worked. I mean, what's it called - of creation apocalypse. There was like Nine Dragons one, right and Nine Dragons comfort me nothing. No one's played that game, except you and me. Alright, literally nobody but there are those actually bigger game that kind of went for the whole Battle Royale with without guns, but it also kind of flattered   Did this is another one in development forgot the name of it. I get emails about it once in a while, but they're trying to make a non-shooter not FPS Maplestory 2 had a battle. Royale. That's right. So did Black Desert like desert? Yes building permit might be doing a little break. That's the one it's TJ. Thanks.  Mei Li play the call to battle royal enjoy it as well.  Battle right rip out. All right, though. The game is pretty dead right now. What was the paladins one called over the pedals Battle Royale those kind of big for like a hot rubber rail realm Royale was big for like a month and then I bet it's dead now. I think it said to you but no no I think was making a bit of a comeback. Last time I checked on Steam charge. Let's take a look. Let's take a look. I enjoy drummer. I thought we were popular it is. Yeah. Yeah. It's been a quiet now. It's been it's been it's been dying. It's down to I mean it really just stabilize probably begin this year kinder.  I can't have from January till this January. Yeah, I don't know the bleed is I think it's kind of stopped bleeding lately. All right, it's never had that big again that I got a hundred thousand. Yeah. We'll see. I don't know. I don't know. We'll see it doesn't look good not looking good boys not looking good.  Hit that hit that worst one all-time most disappointing. I lost my  Spoilers, it's Anthem. See how both disappointing as Anthem. That's right. Yeah, not to what is to be said about that one. I'm everyone's already talked about this for a while. Well, yeah, there's one thing to be said about this. All right. EA has other divisions, right? Why do they keep tasking BioWare which is like the king of our single-player RPGs. Why do they keep asking them with these online only games, you know, like point right? Just get get one of your other Millions to you know, they bought yeah. I actually bought an MMORPG Studio the one that made  Fuck Mythic Mythic, right? So within the close it whatever but clearly they have other divisions that could make online games. Why are they task and get to the guys known for these isometric D&D RPGs? Right? And I don't know so it's crazy and it's in a very strange thing like you said because their Arc like Paradox for example is where room very well known for making their grand strategy games, right and to keep making the same kind of game. They're really good at making let by where make the games are good at making don't distract them with this online, you know and-moe Style.  Among Anthem. It just it is very strange. Now you have other Studios for that. Like you said, you know 476 was also you know, that was was up there for most disappointing. But the thing is at least at for whatever reason there are some people playing Fallout 76 still whereas Anthem is just basically dropped off the face of the Earth.  Me did you put the bug zone 5 times 6 or pretty notorious? I'm sure you've seen internist or and videos. Yes, and you haven't seen those well worth checking out. These other videos do like all the disastrous launch of that game. And how many problems that had there's actually more recent book with Fallout 76. You can actually walk up to people and just Loop their inventory. Nice that seems like a pretty game breaking bugs has it happened in a non like indie game, you know, if it's an indie game with one developer. Yeah makes sense, you know.  Yikes. What a great. Buck. Yeah. Nice. There's some funny YouTube videos of people like doing it and people going where's my stuff?  Also in terms like what's coming up next also related Fallout times. He's kind of with you about New World outside. You think it's gonna succeed, you know, what's funny you're coming out, you know, it's actually an app is coming up with a totally reworked some big chunks of it. You know, here's the thing first. It was about going to the new world being America, right and then, you know fighting the natives and stuff, but then they got lash back from imperialism or like, you know, like some kind of white guilt stuff. I don't know like they literally just want to make a game where you know, you kind of reenact the Age of Exploration you come to America, but that they couldn't do that.  Because of the PC police so instead there's like a magic Island now with like magic Roman legionnaires the skeleton Romans now it so I changed a lot of the setting these people and it seems that they moved away a little bit from the whole survival aspect. It's more like an RPG with like, you know, it's combat and normal Story. I mean additionally still crafting stuff too, but it does seem like they move the bit away from the original like yes, it's trust. Yeah. Yeah exactly. So it was a new world. This was back the frontier like America is settled America's but now it's just like a serve-out you just basically  on his weird magic Island doing magic Quest and killing skeletons and the game's combat May 20 2014 Bucks on Steam and one of the big changes they made is that PVP now is opt in so you can't attack skill a shame that that's a drastic change from like your design philosophy were before it's more like rust where if you're wondering on outside town, you know anywhere you could just die. You know that that's what this whole point of Survival game. They took away PP from being, you know, anything goes Frontier to being opt-in which I think isn't this really a bad design decision because  Obviously the hardcore, you know, the hardcore survival element doesn't have big audience, but it is such a drastic change from their initial like Vision, you know, it seems kind of strange that they decided to make a hardcore game and then the date the way the hardcore I'll mention later on but you know to their credit they flew a bunch of people in and they did a few Alphas faith in testing. So maybe this is a feedback that got back the people just didn't want to play what they had, you know, so I can't totally blame them for having to change. You know, I'm just always so worried when a game changes in that much.  Can it really be good? Yeah, it's certainly possible. But I don't know. It makes me hesitant to really like jump into it, you know.  Yeah, but I mean as long as it's free, I'll test it out. We'll see how it's not going to be forever. It's $40. It's $40. But here's the thing. If you how do you pre-ordered it when it was free would you could have done on amazon.com? I didn't bother because I thought if it's free who cares I'll do. I why pre-order I'll just get it when it's free. But so now cost money, but anybody who pre-ordered it gets it gets to have it for free. They got an email. Wow should have should have pre-ordered New World for free on Amazon ripperino.  There you go. Huh? I mean I know cash you'll play it for quite a bit. He talked to me about it, but I'm not super optimistic. I hope it does. Well the only because I do want to see more and more is out there and they're clearly even if it's like this weird mix of MMORPG and survival and more like it could be interesting to do it. Well, so I'm always rooting for I think I like to think I'm an optimist even though we do kind of shit a lot of games on the podcast but I do always hope for the best like but even start citizen honest, I hope the game comes out and I hope they deliver like even half of they promised. I mean, there's no reason to root for someone's demise.  You get the what's that word trend of food a have something like the German word? Yeah. We were both passing horribly wrong though. Like I really do wish Asher creation and starts engine come out because I do want to see a more thriving Amo atmosphere.  No crowfall still not out Leo of  we did this point like it feels like yeah, of course, it's not out dude that gives different come out.  Stars what it is. It's a little bit of an update on Star Citizen. So with crytek is trying to pull suspend one of the counts as sewing for so one of the in the lawsuit one of them was so you start system one licensed one engine license, but they're making two games right Star Citizen and what it was it was the single player 1 Squadron 42, so they want to they want to suspend that one so they can because they don't think the game's gonna come out anytime soon Squadron. Alright this quarter  The one that's actually to come out to single player game. Well crytek doesn't think it's gonna come out in the next few years. Otherwise, they would have not, you know suspended that one interesting note that this is a speculation based on lawsuit progress. We will see what that means actually. Hmm.  And I said we got one more category here and that is Black Desert mobile as our mobile game of the year. Now. This wasn't exactly an exciting category for us. But with how big this MMORPG specifically are now on mobile we had to at least talk about it. There was actually a pretty big list of mobile images this year being Tales of wind Donna vials world of kings, but all of these are very generic names as you can probably tell at least Black Desert online. I feel like they kind of put together.  The best package with the generic pieces of this job mobile shop, right? So it's not good. It's not any different than world of kings the little more polished right little more original in terms of like the visuals and worldly Kings looks like wow you just copied while so where I was like guys are at least a little bit of a unique aspect to it was perfect world mobile any good. It gives you a pop finish Ina, I downloaded and played it but it really just felt like I was auto-playing and I'd rather autoplay in Black Desert mobile. I was taught to playing in a peripheral mode perfect world mobile did a really cool RAR feature where you can  Actually, like take your character in game and like superimpose it with the a are in that you living room if with the camera feature and looks really stupid but was really fun to play with I it was it was so dumb that it was fun and you can of course make you care to look absurd mean that's kind of like a signature staple a perfect world a you can make your character creation like ridiculous. So doing that with the a our camera was pretty fun in performance, but beyond that is the most fun. I've had you know in Paris Rome. Oh, I mean RuneScape Israel on mobile as well. So there you go. I probably first capable one our award last year for this category.  There's nothing quite like it has come out this year fortunately. It's also like a real and more PG. No RuneScape Mobile versus you know, he's other auto play game. Oh, there's a little update on mobile here. So Tales of wind, which is a mobile Reggie. I think they actually launched a PC version recently. So if you want to check it out, but he was also really bad but usually check it out. If you want to play a bad game with hilariously bad voice acting. Yes, and I'll tiny plates like the first hour just like just a list of the voice acting it is so bad that it's funny. So read the story list of the voice acting you'll get a good laugh out of it and you  understand an hour and you'll call it, you know a little fun little mini session of gaming over there, but it's so bad that it's fun.  Also Chinese auto play pay-to-win nonsense game. So although we talked about we talked a little bit about old school RuneScape mariinsky about they did you hear about a bloodstone know, okay, there's a game called Bloodstone and it launched. I think just a couple days ago actually into free-to-play. It's a present. He's a Brazilian develop game.  That's so thick with this game. You just get like a ski like 55 seconds the show the actual I gameplay for around there.  It's available in both the English and Portuguese and it's it looks a lot like tibia and RuneScape. I mean, it's very clearly inspired by tibia. I know they love tibia and RuneScape down up down except the right just like tibia. Yeah, but it looks looks a little bit different but for some reason, I don't know why I actually I kind of like the graphics here. It makes me want to try this game.  For some reason this this is more attractive to me.  There's a lot of like more modern looking games.  This was like some of the old Ultima games as well.  Well, I think the era of remasters is upon us. So remasters remakes and spiritual successors of these old classic games with, you know, similar Graphics gameplay, but with a new engine so smooth and runs on Modern Hardware. I think that that's it. There's a bright future in that in that ditch me now Leo said, that's exactly what it looks now. I mean, you mean exactly exactly like a pretty sure it's supposed to be a different game. I don't think it just got out of the tibia private server. They don't think it is right. It's not billed as a tibia fracture isn't exactly. It's like  It's super inspired. It's like tempt him I guess and yeah at but what anybody say more so because even though like the art style is probably a little bit different but here it looks like even visually like the exact same artstyle as tibia.  By the game is available free to play on a bloodstone online if you guys are curious.  And it's a lot better than like a poorly made 3 D MMORPG and I'm saying like yeah. Yes, exactly 100% There's some you know.  Let's go you can you can judge a lot about Amanda autoplay. So I'm looking up as auto play in the background. We got the some beats. You can listen to on the right side. You got some Joe Rogan. You got some you have some Rudy from Elf Investments be another bad not a bad setup a little baby. I music. Well, I'm just reading stuff. Yeah, I'd be so embarrassed always show. What's on my autoplay, right? Oh, that's my stuff comes on there. Sometimes they're right, maybe maybe after hour after the podcast and we can think of  There but that was no game. I think it's pretty cool actually do want to give a try and make your first look for it have that the first open a while because we have any real, you know, PCM more piece to cover but this just launched so I mean, I do want to go first and 4/10 him as well. They'll probably come first good. Hopefully 2020 some nice Games come out so I can play some good games. You know, it's been a it's been a dry. It's been a dry year in 2019. Well, we do have a you just say remasters. We do another game coming out this year that probably should have came out like five years ago, but it didn't Sega opened.  Up there close bad sign ups North America for fancy Star online 2. It's actually going to happen here in the west. Finally, you know, this is a game. They had the website for coming soon forever and it is shut the website down thing last year. But now you know what they with the partnership with Microsoft PSO2 is going to happen. There's no other he's a firm release date just yet and I think this first closed beta was only for Xbox users, but there will be something for Windows 10 and PC launched this year.  And you know, honestly, this is definitely one of the better of the of the instance dungeon person helped style games, you know, they really there's a whole lot of games like this. They get a whole lot of games like vindictus so worker closers, you know, it does a million games that follow this formula and this is one the few, you know, this one the few Japanese developed and more BG's. All right all those areas if this is a little bit too little too late though, how do you think it's definitely it's definitely late. All right for sure, but the Japanese version this game still popular.  It's not very popular.  Whoo. Good point numbness The Wanderer, he's saying Sega only now she's they can hold onto their entire stock price and block private server attempts. They don't actually want to release it, which is very strange because this game no, I don't think that's true because I think that being paid by Microsoft to bring it here. Yeah that too Microsoft wants explosives in North America so they can compete with his station also in psychos earnings report. Like I look at all these Japanese companies our knees presentations and reports and PSO2 is consistently listed was a top games for  Every single quarter so this is probably the biggest moneymaker for Sega out of all their games. Wow, the PSO2 still makes tons of money for sex and it's only out of Japan. So the game is consistently popular and profitable in this homework of Japan which makes you wonder why it took this long to come out why they have to wait for Microsoft to bribe them to launch this game in the west like why I do it on their own. It's clearly a successful game.  It is strange and I think you know someone who doesn't play Xbox whoever had an Xbox. I'm kind of grateful for Microsoft because you get cut off all day. Hello.  No, no going on. We lost them. I'm here. I'm here.  If you just lost me, yeah. Yeah, I just lost it for a second. All right. Anyway, Microsoft is actually doing this a lot of favors this year because of bringing us finished our online Cartwright Kart Racer and Crossfire. So a lot of these big Asian games are coming here because of Microsoft.  You're out there. I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to challenge you right now. All right, who can let's take turn Japanese developed. MMORPGs. All right, I'm gonna go first a cheat and say Phantasy Star Online 2. Go twelve thousand fourteen.    My way but I didn't hear you again like this course, but you know, you're not coming through on this Core Final Fantasy XIV when you say Final Fantasy XIV. All right uncharted waters online.  Well, yeah, it's weird. You can't hear me I could now she all right. He's Fantasy XI. Okay, you you know you just cheating go I should say I should have said I have eleven I Dragon's Dogma online something in chat status. I stole from him. Okay Dragon Quest online. You got dragged Quest 1111. I drank West online are really right, isn't it? I don't know. We're drunk last night. Somebody help me out over here.  Are these things called request online those requests love is a new one, which is usually called request online. Yeah, those requests X. Alright as Dragon Quest X. I'll tie it straight. All right Phantasy Star Online.  Hmm. What is it? What's another one?  Poof. We got the Square Enix ones. We got there really aren't that? Oh, I I got it.  No, I can't hear you actually for talking.   That's I can hear can't forgot the name.  Forgot the name boys.  They even have like an anime like opening the name. So if I didn't win I win no, no, hold on any one of the 10 seconds 10 9 8 and then closes Koreans and Marie 6 5 4 3 2 1 and what do you got goal that Megami tensei. Imagine online make a tent. Okay megaten booth.  Let me see what I was thinking of him. Look it up all the crystal Japanese. I that's also Korean a lot of these ones are created when you guys are mentioning.  Blue particle is Japanese. Its by Namco. I was thinking onigiri. Oh, I'll also do I get it to but those old words Japanese, isn't it? Is it I don't think it is it I think so I think so. I'm pretty sure it's Korean. I'm gonna check it.  Developer lion game and they're Korean. I've almost started and the Wizardry online was Japanese. I met in the chap. I didn't think it was for some reason. I thought you had her pinned or saga. Yeah, there are so there are so many and more pee.  What is wrong with our audio? I can't hear this game other launched in 2011 shut down 2014. I like it was a blip, you know, it had no impact none zero zilch.  The checkout Pandora's I look at that you I'll tie this screenshot that we use is perfect for this game. We got this sui and my favorite part of the screen shot on the home page and that page is unregistered hypercam 2 that really captures the feel of 2011. All right amazing.  No one's hurt.  The beauty of these old resolutions is that you I was like half the screen or more mmm.  Hey there, just really aren't that many Japanese developed a more pgs. They're on they're on the ball with mobile games, but just not a lot of you know, you know P CMOS.  Let's SOG online.  There's a bunch of other like yeah get ant Cosmic League from really weird games.  They want to hear still around onigiri is also available on available on PC and console.  That's guys we talked about earlier. I mean I'm ready for it. But it just seems like they change the game quite a bit since their original Vision that it is hard to imagine to come up good. So again, I'm hoping I'm hoping it goes well.  I got a little funnel of story. All right, so ncsoft is a has read their logo. Okay. Let's see the new corporate logo. So here's a local boys. I don't like it. I've killed one better. It's so Bland, you know, they paid good money for this that you know, they like hired a design firm who like they said, oh this encompasses the culture of ncsoft. They don't get it connected, you know on a Cooperative company where design  And this all come together. It's a window to the few clouds and bullshit aside. That's her. So here's what they said about this logo. Okay, guys, let's see how much I disagree with it's going to CEO Kim Tech gin the new CI represents quote craftsmanship enthusiasm and endless challenges furthermore. The sharp edges found on the new company logo was set to symbolize quote Cutting Edge technology with the letters and and see connecting to imply a connected World. Finally a new company tagline was announced window to the Future outlining NC soft.  Eat to build towards the future. That's some corporate bullshit doesn't mean anything right?  I did call the NSC being connected me some kind of Cooperative thing. Alright, I'm connected thing.  You know, they wrote some BS exactly. I mean this is their bullshit but good for them. I did like kind of the role of a better this is this something that has no character. What's not a fan Who characters? Yeah. It's got no soul. All right. It's got nothing.  I was all that and we talked earlier about potential as Delia being the Game of the Year by default by no competition, but the curb but the Korean version of study shut down this year. That's right. Yeah, so even you know, it's already shutting down. So I'm not that makes me kind of hesitant about the Western release the obviously said the Korean shutdown is going to affect us but you know when the games just sign in one market everyone's thinking Hmm Hmm. What's going on boys? It's shutting down to one market people in that Mark. You don't want to play it. You know the whole Market to not just any more cute.  Yeah, so I just can't imagine it doing it's not a good sign when your game shuts down in his homework. It just it's automatic oof.  Again, yeah, she's scars my estimate for lost our quest for for the come out probably late this year as my guest. We've had, you know smile gate announce some hires on their website for an English production manager or something. So they did work on English release and with the Russian release kind of rolling out. I think the next Market is going to be an a  Honest, I think a lot of Dickinson blessed fives in terms of performance and in a celje. It was definitely better than blessed.  Do you remember are?  When's that happening That was supposed to be in beta like two years ago. Yeah, that never happened that that was a blessed 2.0 potentially the visuals of are looks so much like blast. Hey, I don't get why do they tease that trailer and then literally not launch the game and give us no updates in like two years. Now, what's happening how to how does this happen? It's amazing. I don't know. It's going to be so dated by the time it ever comes up. It's on unreal 3, it's already like two years late from when it was already an old game.  It's just I'm not optimistic at what the weird part is like are like the Southeast Asian publisher. I forgot who it was they've released are in like some State and I closed beta like last year. But like that was it like it's making some weird launches other like Parts like in other areas why these going to happen calling, you know, what's gonna happen with there is nothing will happen for two years and then all of a sudden the game will not be playable anywhere until years, right and then all of a sudden game fours with his license.  As they are is coming out in two months Italy some half-ass unfinished version, which is just what they did with no working on the fire to yeah just came out of nowhere. So something like that could happen.   Is very strange.  I'm still kind of Amsterdam. I'm kind of surprised that Kim on the fire to came out like that, too.  I got some overview of numbers for the whole industry aren't for 20 1981. Take a look. Yeah, I love thinking to this industry number. All right. So let's look at this big old chart right here. Oh God. All right costly. I'm call it console games and mobile games are going to be growing. Everything else is going to be a shrinking its 2019 according to these dudes, which is New Zoo smartphone gaming was 46% which is smaller than what I thought but I think this dis NEW Zoo one counts physical sales still sorry. So this is still counting like the  For just for Nintendo the PlayStations games you buy at GameStop. So this counting that keep that in mind.  So we got 46% from mobile 30% Council and PCR boy is only a 24.  our boy  So nice mobile nine point nine percent year-over-year the most growth I think PCS I should shrinking. How does that make you guys feel another PC Gaming revenue shrinking?  It's Embrace mobile. All right, I put a little bit of bra Stars this last week quite a bit of rock stars actually had some friends over and we went Ham on bra Stars last week. So there it is.   I prefer super data's research. All right to do there is I think it's more interesting for the most part. I think I'm super dead stuff, too.  The other twin 19 year in review I got check that out. Did you see that one might be an old one actually.  I wrote down the numbers. I don't have the actual link to it though. So Fortnight May 1.8 billion a year according to stupid data.  I'm I'm going to link you are the super data report take a look at it. All right.  Look at the 2019 year-in-review sure. This is a  It's a new one. I mean I can't they can't do a year in review without the year being over. So let's let's let's skip through this one together should be some fun industry data on this one. I got to open this way. They do one of these every year I do like these are free considering most of the super data industry reports are generally very expensive.  All right. Well, that's true as well a kick a 55 is always a nominal revenues are growing not architecture. It doesn't matter. That's true. But I think actual revenues shrinking for PC. So it's not just market share. It's you know nominal Revenue.  Let's take a look at this.  So this one member superg data only looks at digital. So that's why consoles a lot smaller smaller here than it was another one because this is only counting digital sales on Console. That's still the one area where you know, it's Constable physical still exactly is still some physical going on consoles and mobile is sixty four point four billion versus digital PC like but a PC games are basically all digital. Anyway, when was the last time you bought a PC game in like  Like a CD and installed it like never right?  They do you remember the last time you did that but GameStop used have a PC section like literally died five years ago and they got rid of that five years ago. There's no more PC games like a physical format know there are yesterday dedicate doc. I am fine like the only time you'd ever use a series like maybe if you want to install Windows XP for the reason, otherwise yourself my USB anyway,  Yikes. Yeah this I haven't you seen these in Forever, you know even physical game that kind of cheating now, like if you bought the Spyro game or the or the Crash Bandicoot Trilogy, you want a physical copy the disc that came with only had like one of the first stage on it. The rest has to be downloaded. Hmm. So it wasn't even like do you think it the full game on a disk now? Did you see how much money for night made in 2019? Yeah, 1.8 billion so you could try to change boys 1.8.  Billy  free-to-play gaming accounted for four out of every five dollars spent on digital games between 19. Thanks to mobile games.  Number two here dungeon Fighter online 1.6 billion on our Kings 1.6 billion and League of Legends 1.5 billion. So guys dungeon Fighter online makes more money than legal Legends an amazing things that shitty mobile MOBA makes more money than League of Legends. It's insane legal Edge was before I firmly number one or two area. Yeah, but don't you fire a line guys is is the most popular free to play game. I'm curious this list includes Our World of Warcraft that we pretty much nothing, but these look at the  These are the other can only free to play games that chart.  The body playlist is not that exciting FIFA 19 made Center a six million apparently.  While I was going down, but they said they had a huge uptake with.  with the classic launch  Pokemon go still made an insane amount of money.  We want to go.  One point four billion dollars. Is it amazing Pokemon go almost made us it might as a is League of Legends. Yeah insane. Yeah. I wish I wish this included World of Warcraft Revenue, but it's been really hard to get a good look at how much my World of Warcraft this make I mean glitches and pretty moan about it. And these industry reports have rarely spell Out World of Warcraft by itself, and they some of the old super data reports did have it to three years ago, but some really meaningful today. I just haven't seen a good number for World of Warcraft like this year. We're honest.  Even like 548 specifically though. We'd have a good proxy for that by just looking at the entire Mo division for three nights and just pretending it's all fancy 14 2011 bunch of rounding error Dragon Quest online. Isn't that popular?  You have missed a pinned area on CD. Nice. There you go. You got you you still have PC game scars.  Me to master time. I still see people playing Pokemon go like in the wild when I go for a walk through on therefore. I see them play Pokemon go all the time. Yeah, it's not only is it alive? It's making one point four billion dollars a year since same.  frequent order boys 1.2 billion the wife of collector  a bunch of players people exactly a lot of kids still play it too. I mean I a kid who he prefers Pokemon go to the actual Pokemon switch games. He'd rather spend $40 on Google Play gift cards so we can fund his Pokemon go no currency and by the actual Pokemon game, I'm actually amazed how much money that games making it cheering. It's like it just seems like the monitor the monetization when it first came out of this was not like super gotcha style RNG, right?  You call it, you know, it seemed like pretty pretty tame the monetization for that game and it still makes a lot of money which kind of goes to show if I guess you don't need to go super like predatory to make tons of money.  It seems like that games monetization is fairly reasonable as far as mobile games go.  Yeah Boy uncle is good for y'all to get you walking in and being outside unless you're done with that one cheat it like everybody used apparently so what do you think of of Candy Crush Saga making the same amount of money as legal Legends it's it's interesting that you know, these super casual games are so popular I'm not surprised honestly this is the playerbase just enormous in those games so I'll have you seen have you seen the Center Towers top worldwide Revenue 2019, let's see this one  Have you even there? I've never even heard of coin Master know what the hell is coin messed everything else on this list have heard of it leads, right? But apparently coin Master is a top-tier Gameboys coin Master. Where's that me see that and then overall Revenue number nine. Number nine. We master. I see now Roblox made several million dollars in revenue on mobile.  Roblox is absolutely killing it.  I mean biggest gains among the kids are still Fortnight Roblox and Minecraft. Yeah. I feel like a lot of people every nose on my card. I feel like Roblox doesn't get the doesn't get like the for deserves. It doesn't get this credit. It deserves but they're killing it. You know, there's the game is huge. It's a on par with Minecraft probably like it close to it.  Gets no respect doesn't give respect on the streets. All right it ought to  so 2020. Where are we going to get any of these Kickstarter and more apt to be actually release time some of the classics like Paragon crowfall Park was really really Chronicles battery as you creation or citizen. No, no, honestly, none of those things are classified none zero zilch. Yeah, probably right? Yeah. No, we did say ask your creation did come out and say they're going to be doing their Alpha sometime in our 2020. That's for the that's the PCI, but I put the news on the most not coming. I'm still you know.  I wanted to come out but I'm seeing how much our disaster Asher creation apocalypse was the game average like three players online now, so it's totally dead. They did come out and say you know Intrepid is Dick we're going to release Alpha One sometime in 2020 and they said that on January 1st, so they have until the end of the year. It's really some version of the Alfa and I don't think it's gonna be like a particularly, you know in depth or close to release version of the Alfa and it will not be under NDA. So whatever they do release you can everyone be able to see and I think I think 2020 will kind of collectible like people realize what this Alpha.  Whether the game is going to happen or not. I think based on what we see with that Alpha we can write instantly write it off for now, but I've kind of already wrote it off in my own mind, but for some reason I'm still hoping to do a good job, and I won't buy one more thing real quick and maybe if you guys have more  Into details you can actually read the full thing, but Star Citizen released a 20-18 financial post all bunch of numbers charts and all that if you look at their total income so you could chart right here.  Every year right there going up. There's a bad shark. It's like black on black. But so every year the revenue has gone up pretty much none of you but like there this 2018 was our best year yet and I think 2019 is probably even higher than this. So people are still given the money and the dark with the Lubbock. The biggest chunk here is pledges. / you know, the big number you see on the crowdfunding. Yeah. So the making a ton of money still and I feel like they can keep this going for as long as people get the money. So I don't think it's a question for induction Revenue.  For Star Citizen all-time high guys. They they have Peak subscribers in Star Citizen and it still didn't come out of me. There are people since 2013 there were oh yeah brought and monthly subscription Star Citizen. Yeah, man, I can't wait to comes out and you know, I can do all this shit and there's still subscribe. There are people that probably subscribe for six years Star Citizen and you're subscribed to like this game that didn't quite release yet. It's not a tech demo right now with like well like this this start fighting mode where you just kind of battle like the most off and the big promise to do.  A cool stuff. I start system really haven't happened yet.  Yeah, but I think it I think there's a set number of people that are going to keep giving them money. So I don't think gonna crash and burn this year. I think to keep going at the current pace. So now big update this year. I don't think chaos Shield the 30 months in a row you're late, but your message always always on time in my heart telling us that meat on this off at 14 to read more me not go.  There it's remarkable that Star Citizen hit an all-time high in revenues. And the way this is going this there's no rush. There's no like guys we need to get this game out. Let's wrap it up. You know, no more new features. Nothing just make it happen. That's never gonna happen the revenue constantly flowing in so don't expect anything.  I'm actually much progress on this front.  By me they are putting to their credit. They are putting these statements out. I don't know how you know again, I didn't read the whole thing. I don't know how exactly this is, but they've a lot of a huge staff. So you look at the head count. They have 521 people on staff it 2018 dwarf knocks with this Tier 1 subscription much love.  What you appreciate it?  So we'll see if they can what happens here, but there is a lot of people boys.  One day boys one day one day these these Kickstarter game is going to come out and that's another reason why I'm excited for temp temp. It was a Kickstarter announced game, but I could tell from the Kickstart. Whoa, like I was hesitant. I first heard of it, but I've watched a video my okay, like based on this video. They're showing me gameplay the show me real content. The most frustrating thing is you look at a Kickstarter and you see like character creation and I guy running around an empty feel like a guy running around at the field is not gameplay. That's literally default Unreal Engine.  Just running around like anyone can install and religion today lot of some back at some like store-bought backgrounds and it's sure a character running around the forest or like some Fields. That's nothing but when I saw the UI the gameplay for tempting like whoa, this game is actually happening and they went from announcing that Kickstarter in 2019 to releasing their Early Access like this month. So they're moving really quickly and you could you can usually tell how far game actually is in process by looking at their Kickstarter and whatnot. And it's what's really remarkable for me though is I'll Take Em out and chain.  Damn that release a single new Gameplay trailer for Camelot changes 2016. Do you know nothing? I did not know exactly though. So every time I cover Camelot Unchained in our in our news video, I look for new gameplay videos and official channel, right? The only way I can find is when the Dragon Con presentation of 2016. Now keeping you were using that one 2016 video like how have they not shown any new like real gameplay since then because the distance there's so little to show I guess and it is crazy and he'll when we start demos right? We're like excited because there were so many of these games in Kickstarter or like  The expert mode and were like, oh Tim so many games to cover was so excited. But like literally none of them have launched. Yeah.  So Legend of area came out that's what charge online is called now, and I don't think it's been doing well actually want free to play so you can try it on Steam, but I don't think it's doing particularly. Well, why don't you want I say it's worth trying only because it is different. It does feel a bit like Albion online to a degree but like less pupae moral Fraulein and they're doing dude. I don't want to call the game in a bit of but it kind of by default gets called in a bit of because like, it's really just a reclone of Ultima Online and old school RuneScape and that alone makes it different from so many other games.  But then again you could just play old school RuneScape. You could just play, you know, ultimately private service and get the same experience. But for that reason I still recommend just trying it because it does feel different in other flavors of you know, Karina mortgages and what not and I said it is free now so it doesn't mean the reviews are quite mixed here. But remember the scene of went up and it's not available just on Steam as well. I mean most of the hard core fans have been playing the game off steam game launched. I've seen relatively recently or August 29th was released on Steam busting out in numerous betas off steam.  Team. So plenty of people that actually really like the game of playing off steam as well. As numbers aren't as bad as they seem though. Obviously, not particularly great either and it's free to play. So cost. You nothing to check it out. I mean, it's an MMO and when your player bases are low, you really do have to go free to play like there's no there's no option to charge money when you game is basically low player base because then both thrives on community, you know, it's a network effect. And if you have no players there is a network effect. Zima spoken. Let's see Maria is a duke or he says, all right, but if he still do  Like the Duke of our country rather than like a do Kurt, which is actually poop. Maybe he just really likes the game referring to as a class and ability.  Rest in pepperoni WildStar. I cannot believe ncsoft just shut it whilst are down. They should we should like petition to buyer for like $10 just put up our own server. Yeah, I would love classic style star and T stuff. I pay you more than $10 for whilst our okay. Give me the give me the server code give me everything. I'll buy it the official license. All right 10 G's that's the most shocking. Well, it's there. All right the 10 G. That's a real game. Okay. I think we offer like $1,000 like really shitty Korean or Chinese game, but I would love to have a real game. Like well start right like they're not going to sell David.  Yeah, and they could sell for more if they want to do they shut it down completely but be cool to have a you know, well, are there any well Sarah private service?  I don't know. It's your question. Probably not. I don't think so either. Let me check.  Yeah, it'd be cool to have but all right there. Did they have been some active development? Apparently who emulators going for it, but as it was a year ago, I don't think we saw an update since then so I don't think there's any official any like ones making good progress, unfortunately.  But because they get it and it does it is sad to see like a full-blown and more PG say what you will about the game media. There's a world there me there's some a few things felt really good about while start the movement and just running around and combat that felt really good A lot of them were kind of screwed it up on that front of like well, it's hard to be good job. Do you I need to work but it is a ran smooth a member. If you try to play the game. I liked in 1920 by 1080 the you I was like a by 50% your screen or more if you have a 2K resolution is to you. I had to go very modern with that one. Yeah, I remember that.  Yeah, but it's still set to see it go like when you see like other more be shut down and nobody plays it's not so sad, but seeing a game like WildStar shutdown is a big feelsbadman.  Especially when you think there's enough there to keep it running like it's going to be a huge moneymaker, but I feel like so many of these like Chinese Korean games are still running with literally five players, right? So why couldn't Walters keep it running with five players? Yeah. I don't know. I don't know just just just a figure on the game to give it to a if it is super games, you know, and they think about it, but games is still there's some weird shit going to Super Games. Okay. I'm convinced this some kind of money laundering operation.  I was like, how could they keep the lights on all time with with this portfolio of games on it? Let's let's appreciate this portfolio for a moment. All right. All right what we got here got Ace Online. We got a satellite maximum players 6. There's not more in there are not more than six players on Ace online right now. Okay. Look at their latest news announcements. Okay there ladies and that's it wasn't was in November 7th 2018. Okay. It's like to you that you know 2018 is that bad and before that, you know these announcements like the scroll at the bottom do I get 20 2013? All right.  You can update their rules in 2013 and three years later than announcement in 2016 one year later. They posted one announcement a year. Okay, how are these guys still around?  How like and and I still get like press release from them. Sometimes I did them in a partnership. I forgot where I closed beta on December 29th of Glory Ventures on their homepage. That's a December 2019 this year. That's December 2019 2017. All right. Hey ladies, let's take two years ago three years ago.  There's some weird shit going on with with with sugar games for sure. Like I don't know what's going on. There's no way they're making money on that business. I know there's some weird announcement recently miss you can find it.  Okay. So apparently I Axion announced a publishing deal for Morris infinite Dimension with supe games for five countries and they got a new game coming up boys is a partnership with accessing games for Moore's. If I don't know what Mars infinite Dimension is that game the fact that these chose to partner with supe games tells the game is ass like automatically there's like nobody does like you know what you know, who we should give our game to let's give it the stupid games, you know, they're they're on the ball with their portfolio titles. You know, you look at that website like  No, this is like we're games go to die or they died already in the resurrected. Nobody wants to announce that you're working with super games. It is not a good like, you know brag about that. All right, but apparently this game is on guys.  Check it out. First until is an oldie. Oh, yeah.  It's all that if you search on Mars at the church Mars, if it dimensions of Google Mars, let me give you an I can't find anything about this game. They announced the I got the press release last month the day they're going to be published by super games.  Nothing out there, right? There's a trailer on YouTube this reduction. Okay, Shake It Out shake his I've not seen this I search Google for this game you find nothing.   I'm excited. It's a Sci-Fi. So I'm going to volume up here. It's unlisted. How'd you find this video?  I got you know about it. Oh it there be at me. I'm Burning Bridges. I'm keeping it real. All right.  It's a CGI trailer boom unimpressive and Skip around there's no gameplay in here.  By putting this game to be published by Super Games sometime. So we have no idea what it is. Great Trail. Yeah. I know what is either but penny is based on a franchise called Mars. I mean they have probably the franchise.  Secret on listen Masterpiece of since they said that since they said that news out like only 6 million watch the trailer. So it's not a obviously not doing not doing great. I'm surprised Luna online reborn apparently is a thing on here as well. But I can't imagine if a place that either it's just weird to see this company still around they're doing something they're doing some weird things. I don't know what's going on. This gives got six players online.  Well, how about we move on to the post game before they assassinate US for all right. We thought he's a mad shit about forgot them their money laundering schemes and get shut down if we keep going. So, all right guys. All right guys. All right. See you guys in the post game. Take care later for you, too.	I mean we kind of mean the batter for a while in the past, but this is the first time I'm seeing a guy so there's no mail jet in a female and once you're done with the character you can choose your Oh now she heard he him they them now obviously, I think a lot of people going to get kind of like a knee-jerk reaction to like, oh my God, that's you dummies are ruining gaming but like I thought about it for a second like who and I realized who cares like it's is this really hurting anyone's experience of the game and my answer is no I'll thank you, so you think no and here's the thing though.  You cannot use extra tax at the beginning of a fight, you know, you have certain tasks available on the first turn and your second turn will start charging up and you only use after it's fully charged that point is charged with you can use it then and then start recharging up again and obviously more powerful text take longer to be able to use later in the fight as well as the require you to have use a more stamina if you use abilities, we add a stamina you take damage yourself, so Database we try to design the game around a hundred based skill and strategy rather than RNG which Pokemon is notorious for I mean, you could just lose a game to crits in Pokemon and and missing attack.
spotify:episode:56cTRXbwqr3XtyD6hGcXGI	Hello and welcome to the dance show your dad podcast. I'm Jonas like co-host Weston.  They don't need so yeah, a lot of crap happened to me. I'm not going to say any names because but basically like she is sure our life is like so much more messed up than mine.  Like I can't even relate to her life. And so she has all these friends that are keep constantly going after me because I'm dating her. So I just know that's way too stressful. I'm not doing that and I hated myself every time I like a thought of it which was kind of stupid.  But then she complains it complains about it. She's like all you think you're this stupid won't tell me it's all me and the stupid one. Yeah, it was really he's really stupid didn't you that you had a girlfriend earlier like that like last year this year now last year this year. So what's the deal with her?  I know she is reading cheese. It's kind of  She was difficult. She wanted all these things.  That was just like I don't know just chill out. This is out of the ordinary. But like what's the greatest thing? That's not like relationship with it's not with a human. Like what do you find like close to a dog? A dog dogs are like humans but like better. Yeah. Um, I like music music smoothing if you ever tried writing music do ya you have actually have this arshile every ever.  Music alright, so what music?  Me and we got a form a band or something. You got ya have you ever liked red light in this room before? Yeah. I've played my stomach. That's about it. Yeah, I play drums. My basement is so crappy right now like God, I hate it so much. It's like there's like spiders like, oh, I hate it. I like went. Okay so into the basement as  Hold the gun. I was cleaning up everything because the weight set down there was moved. So I just wanted to clean up everything. So I like found this hole in the ground that was covered with weights. Right when I put the way to up a spider's flew out of the column. That's very spooky. I'm just crawled up the wall. And then I just ran upstairs and said no fuck that. So I think what everyone's curious about is how you read any race from sense.  No, I have I have I am I predicted that the spider was like since who knows how long that spiders been down there. You probably crawled up and he's like, all right, and so we just went back down there. So my thesis is that he wind up back down there. And so I would like to on there and I covered it with everything the whole so it wouldn't come back out again. You should be a scientist. I don't know. I'm pretty smart.  Hey guys, I got an A. I got an A+ and fired three Smurfs.  Yeah, I got an F in fire. That's how fat I am. What what do you think? Okay makes a  bad person bad person  What do I do?  bad person  Yeah, I was thinking about that and I broke up a lily a couple like you're not a bad person. I know but I don't feel like it though.  But what do you think about it? It's like  I mean you gotta keep this is a podcast here. I keep talking that doesn't care about what people think because  I've been someone that's like really frigid estate doesn't care about what other people we all I don't know. Yeah, there's a is confusing to me because I like to try not to care what other people think about me. Yeah, but I want to I want to care about them which I it's kind of hard because I have people issues. I don't know why it's a confusing thing. It's something that hard. I got us like stop getting too much like  In the people's lives because like I remember if you like anyone.  You want to know that it's just that but what about that? All right, so maybe used to cut himself. Oh, wow. Yeah, and so that crap really God. I got to talk to the school counselor because I'm like, I need help. I just don't know what to do. My friend is killing himself and then she's like just stop like caring about him and I'm like, what is wrong with you? You stupid woman?  Choose your mouth closed you jerk.  I think I've known it where we got the name for dance to your dead podcast.  That's just because we're like right now the video of danced her. Dad is right on the screen now, I'm like, oh it's name Pockets dance to your dad. That sounds fun. I've ever tried podcast before I have and I totally screwed up because it was like one then morning and it was like my friend and this other dude that I don't know. So I was actually kind of retarded naturally like the audio wasn't me so mad because like both sound exactly the same.  We got the deep voices cool. I don't know if people are going to think that we will he look like  I know a lot of people deep voices that are like really really skinny. When you think about people deep voices you think really skinny or like not skinny right yikes. I don't know purple band had a deep voice and he was like really scary. Yeah usually deeper than what he's like.  Mother puberty hit me so hard. I like it. There's like straight up got the tooth by for like smacking the butt and my voice was like so high for that internally. I wasn't happy God. What do you do you like angsty like the angsty Style?  I don't know.  When you mean, you don't know not much really you're not anything. You think you're an angsty person Define angsty stuff like just like really like  I don't know you like Do Your Own Thing?  And ideally you don't really care about anyone else doesn't like you the sure I makes you yeah, what kind makes you you?  Is Roy could give a shit about what people think of me and I do whatever the fuck I want. That's good.  bored bored and so what he did was like we let it fall on the ground and we just did that for like the whole  This keyboard is like almost demolished by that time and then it was only to later where we threw too late.  It was quite the experience should like this that you should like we should like put that on YouTube and Link it to this video podcast. It's only been nine minutes. Jeez.  All right, either plug has like four hours dude, four hours. Well, no, I'm like 3 or 2 hours me make it one 450 early other 50 50 minutes might be like 50 year on our fault like  It comes up.  What do you think about that?  I'm trying to think of what do you think? What happened to actually do you think he's still alive? He's not alive and all the people that are making videos on his death. I don't know if they're just grieving. Yeah, I'm sorry about just can't bring on the um, I was saying because like especially next year where  Pizza is just a time just came out June 18th. Next year next month. I'm stupid. Sorry. Yeah, a bunch of people say that he's still alive or something but reason he's dead is because he wants put down the freakin phones and looks up like they would they're just they keep recording it - I know I'm giving resuscitation or checking his pulse. I don't see anyone like trying to like dragging my own and give him like CPR on the ground her for a minute.  Accordingly volume in the car. Yeah. It was really really stupid.  God like he might've actually going to be able to shed some like seven few less were just like the hospital like why you just gonna sit there and record someone's dead. And then toast on YouTube. That's the thing seems kind of fucked up. That's the thing. I don't I don't really agree with this generation. I don't I feel like  I feel like the one they're making me God is making really like oh what's put him in the wrong generation? I don't feel like I belong here in this like sort of social media phones thing and it's not that I use I'll I use it a lot. I use it too much. But if you if you're on it way too much then your social skills would get diminished. I guess that this kind of thing is like a test to see if we can still talk and have meaningful conversations because we don't want to be on our phones all the time.  Steve is because your salt yeah like your social skills with just soaked wrapped up and shiny and stuff. Yeah, I can speak on experience. I'm not to him. I know it's so hard to like you gotta like Turk gotta get back from that because if you're on your phone so long you just want to not talk to anyone and there's like a bunch of other stuff like  Like you can get there's so much links to social media. Like you'll get addicted to so much things inside cells me you get a you just Snapchat you get addicted to Instagram you get you get addicted to porn hub like yours people that waste their lives on horn instead of going out friends. They literally just like stay in the room and find the perfect clip and then just do that. Yeah. It's like so awful man. I bet you I can now if you're fearful, but I mean, these are things you don't say  Is but I'm pretty sure that everyone that even cook some this video is gonna be like, oh, this is Timmy Weston, you know, there's a camera. We love you crappy exactly YouTube people addicted to YouTube. I see so many computers elementary kids that only wants you to vulnerable iPads. It's so bad for you. I mean, especially with all the toxicity to do like because for night and bunch of other  Trendy things on be honest with you y'all as so far at night. You can look up anything at all. And I guarantee you there's going to be a fortnight version gaming gaming go to YouTube and then go to Jamie dude for and I'll be the first thing about I bet you $100. That far tonight is the first thing to pop up. If not, I will freaking yeah, I game I really wish would come back and it kind of is is Minecraft Minecraft was like yeah kind of back.  It's like a less toxic. It's like ever there's some kind of weird Essence to it. It's kind of it's a game. That's why I don't know I'm talking deeply about a Minecraft is the greatest game Minecraft is the thing in our generation like you came up when we were in kindergarten. Yeah. It's it's our childhood and we can't say it isn't because it came out went we were old enough to play it but I played as soon as I found out about it. Yeah. I really just  Crowd around each other and just play Minecraft. That was so funny how he played in The Kill Bill? All right. I remember my friend Damon had a phone and I would just always beg him to play Minecraft on his I thawed whatever. All right so mean to him went to school together for four years. Well, I'm indifferent for it now, but I was it to me for since fourth grade. And so there's this place called cuteville. It was like one of those things where if your parents are like work, too.  And you can't get a ride home together after school day care. Yeah that place a lot of crap happened there. We did some missed it was because we're the oldest there and like all the children like I don't think any of the Children looked up to us. They just all like, okay stay away from those. Hey, yeah, and even if we weren't rather like this one teacher that was such to so so mean  I know her name is Ruth Ruth rad. We called it covid and ever since we called it covid all the other kids called it Colville and then so I'm pretty sure that that eventually lawyers got riding and that'd be funny kill though. Everything was a joke to us. Yeah, we would run around in the hallways. We'll talk.  Someone like you're gonna get me fired. You just laugh at them give a girl threaded it then a girl threatened to kill my entire family. I just told the staff and got her like suspended from school or something like that and it's like okay sweetie. Oh my god, dude.  Yeah, all we did was go into the hallway because no one was out there except for us. Yeah, there's this little room that a bunch of bikes in that when you going in the hallway and then when you're on the way to your Kill Bill and then the kill those right to the right and then you go to the street music is weird room, I think exit  You know I'm talking about we're okay with the doors for kid Ville and then you like go down and then there's like no other preschools. Oh my God, I just remembered. All right, so can kill Phil there's a way that you can like get into the preschool rooms. Okay. Yeah, so you got straight.  And so when you go to that hallway, all right, so there's a hallway straight that just leads to an exit and then if you look to your right kill those right there and if you go to your right where you kill is there's another hallway connected to kill though. That's the left and so let's draw the preschool rooms are it's right by the daycare and so literally mean Timmy would just go in there.  And just be in the preschool rooms yelled at so bad.  And yeah, but even they were obsessed with so many things to you were such a cute Creepypastas. Yes, just a killer. Yeah, definitely Sunderman. It was all until like the stabbing thing happened here was like, what's that one? Like the son of man stabbing the girl did that? Oh, yeah just have the kid 19 times.  Yeah, that happened. Anyways, yeah, we like if you play the game there's like notes in pages that you have to collect in order to win. Then they're scattered across in the woods. And though it may be there was like so creepy the other creepy things right now. So we decided to make our own and put them across the playground if it would freak out if I show you T30 teacher found one and I saw our crumple it up and kind of throw it away if that won't  how nice yeah, we almost got in trouble. So my kind of those really crappy this summer going to kid Ville was really fun though. But like we would just run around the fucking hallways with RDS is recording each other. Oh, yeah, that was some pretty low. But we were 14. I mean, we're in fourth grade - in fourth grade. We're 14 now. Yeah, we had this little fluffy gang we pretend while your  We pretended that you YouTubers who really make videos. But yeah, you post any one we just made and I'm right here. Yeah, because you're obsessed with YouTube. We were little. Yeah because yeah, it was really stupid. But anyways, I don't want to get into that because I was cringy that was very crazy. That's very crazy. Um, yeah, we have the yeses but meantime we can ever play because he's always had a 3DS because he's a rich kid. I hadn't died only a Nintendo. I played just like Super Mario and stuff.  of  And then to me, I like GTA and I'm so sick. Yeah. Oh, yeah, my dad bought it for me and my mom totally want of approved cuz I was like  really 10. I know I have to be I'd have to be nine when I was in for the word. I'll see when I don't know if you're if I mean I could just do the math right now, but I would take like six minutes and I eating everyone at least six minutes in a podcast. That's like awful.  I mean dude, I miss Tom Landry a little bit. But now do things have changed so much and people have changed so much. Yeah, it's cool. They're in elementary schools. Obviously in the assholes. I wonder what it would be like if I didn't leave.  Like it'd be weird because when I got into and out people hate me because they don't even know me now. I was bullied so much but that's because like no no me and I was like a little buried glasses and the hair and we're striped shirts and then people thought I'd autism. Okay, I think it's a joke. There's a lot of intelligent people that are  You do have autism and they're extremely smarter than I could ever be like you could work so hard in your life and you will never get an appointment from those people.  But um, yeah, I wonder what it'd be like if I didn't leave it all like what do you think you would be like because it is people really hate us in fourth grade.  They just didn't that isn't mom like magic dust people still hate me. Yeah, but what if I didn't even last mile over though?  What you see a less now that you're in like Tech it's technically high school because we don't have a middle school. But we're I'm going to be middle. I'm going to be a high school next year. Yeah same technically but whatever. Yeah. Well, yeah, it's like you see people less and less.  And it's like all those kids have gone off to go do other shit and I'm like, I don't know you you just seem less and less. Yeah, and the other thing and this kid, I don't want to say names. Are you brought a freakin switchblade and taser to school and he got busted for that. Jeez. Joyous is okay. Oh, yeah, you only got suspended for two days what this other?  Person brought weed edibles to school and got busted for that and she got suspended for 5 days. I don't it seems like that's a little not as serious like God. I'm just saying because like I maybe I'm going to sound like a complete old dad, but maybe it's just like the phones and all the stupid social media that makes it all like, you know, that makes all the crappy stuff that makes everyone bed people make that make that  people  because like vaping in like losing your virginity in and all these stupid challenges like putting a condom through nose and pulling out of your mouth and eating Tide Pods. That's all from social media. Like if someone did that in the 2020 like 200 years ago, they would just be dead like, oh howdy that all you type has. Oh cool, but nowadays. It's like watch I record myself eat Thai buds now everyone's going to do it, too.  well  Social media does have benefits to like it does I'm not going to say it's like a station like Xbox and stuff like that. Like my mom knows it. Hope you like forget about my day. If I had a bad day. It gives you a chance to connect with people from different places and different. Yeah, you used it. I'm not saying it's all bad. Just getting like lost in a fantasy world to yeah is what I'm not like it's only for people that just only do it like they do it only they do whatever they let it control you. Yeah, and  Just they do it so much that they can't talk their social skills are so bad.  It really yeah, it's bad.  What did ya the internet in the words of axes that the internet is like a drug and people post pictures of themselves like half-naked tube-like get attempt to get ya to get attention and like boost her confidence. It's it's like you think it's a curse, but it's also like a good thing too. Yeah. I mean when when I see like eight-year-olds with phones  I didn't have a phone until I don't have my phone till last year like last year's when I got my first phone. Oh, yeah, and I'm 14 right now. So I was just 13 it was right after my first cross-country practice and I was so happy because on the first day you eat pancakes right after you run slow and it's sick.  I got my first one when I was 9 but it was just like a little flip out keyboard phone goes over it. I think I used to stay up all night watching Five Nights at Freddy's conspiracy theories and Minecraft Let's boys. Yeah. Those were the days my God for now dude Five Nights at Freddy's that was another Obsession and we're in Kill Bill. If we were like a little bit older back, then we could have figured out the whole thing. Yeah, we're Brave.  We are friends were only like thing about the Five Nights at Freddy's stories. Yeah that I mean, I know the games really cringey now and all the stuff that came out with it is like really stupid. Yeah, but like I have major respect for the story. Yeah, it's or easy so dark and it's so complicated. Yeah, so it's so so like fund of try to figure it out too. Yeah just got cousins a freaky. I don't know what kind of messed-up guy is. I mean he's not messed up but like the  you're at the store is really dark, but it's really really really good. It's like  Insane and even when I thought I found out what the story was in fourth grade. I'm like, I'm like I'm I just like stopped like looking out messing around with enough and then now it is when I look at like what the story is is she's like nothing compared to what I thought it was and so I had to watch the video and it was like my brain was just exploded. I still don't like even remember like I know that there was a fire and it was like there was the second  I don't know just like everyone like a weirder order like it went from like the the like the first one to the third one to the second one to the fourth one, which is like the final one because the kid sitting at home and then there's like the pizzeria one, which is connected to everything then you gotta you gotta rearrange the order of them, but now there's these new like  That what Toria or something some like some sister location thing that that was that was right after that was before the pizzeria. I don't like this sister locations. There's I like the original Five Nights at Freddy's 4. Well  I hate the people that hate games like that. Like the people like is Five Nights at Freddy's was the game that came out and a lot of it. It attracts a lot of like those Eagles eight-year-olds. Sorry, I hit puberty really fast. I'm sorry. Anyway all she looks like a girl now. It's like you're really cringey girls that watch like, I mean, I'm not saying it's a bad thing like they watched a lot of anime. Oh,  Yeah, and then they like they always like try to act email and not talk to anyone but they just build Delphine on the right. Anyways, yeah, there's a lot of if we offend anyone it's not our fault or 14. We're just doing this so we can actually have a meaningful conversation. Sorry in advance. Like like I still have school. I guess. I'm sorry.  Her yet. I still have two weeks left. So then I will week-and-a-half. Basically. Yeah, we can have his oh, yeah fish for me to know I have a week to be going to Valley Fair for field trip. And then we did you go last Friday. No, we didn't go yet rewind like the week after next week. I skipped that field trip because I hate it. I hate people I hate rides. I hate this yelling. I don't believe you gonna do that sometime. No, you gotta get out there.  No matter if it's a people or not, you don't even have to talk to them. I've been the valley Fairy before and I know what it's like it's she boring because it's not my type of thing. Yeah, super hectic and it's just not that great. I just have people if she's because overrated I don't like talking to his overrated, but I don't like talking to  I don't know. There's a there's a people that are just so can they be so toxic sometimes? Yes, especially in toxic relationships like the ones that it's like you just have lost for them. And I think it's like a trap because then you start you feel like you started liking other people.  And then you're just trapped because you can't because if they still love you, then you don't want to say I don't love you anymore because you feel empathy for them and you just can't get out because you're trapped. Yeah, it's that happened to me today, right? I but I got out of it. I just said I'm breaking up with you, but it wasn't because I didn't have empathy for it wasn't because I was bored with her it was because I was  I just I didn't want all the stress of her friends attacking me.  And it's not her fault. It's just her life is really messed up.  But she's a really choose really strong person. She like she still does stuff. She I'm surprised she's not nothing like Killers out here and I was going to send morbid but still she's a strong tough version. Yeah. Yeah. I was just I broke up because I didn't think I was you know, I was ready for because she was just like this much number than me. I think I got to be like way more numb than I am right now because I can handle some situations. But if it's like constant,  Constant people of bugging me or constant people annoying me constant people giving crap about me then it'll mess me up. I can tell ya I've like kind of like known what her life not really though. Well, I everyone has issues. I've like known some of her issues and stuff. I don't know. She seems like she is like not like no issues at school closed.  He's like the popular girl kind of she's she's but yeah, you're kind of right. It's I seen a lot of this stuff happened like Kelly who stepped Edge you it wasn't names can cut that out. What's it tickle? Okay so hard anyways, yeah, her stepdad was really really abusive and her parents were really nice. She had been house but  It wasn't anything serious like her stuff that wasn't sexually abusive but he did he was pretty like creepy like, oh my God, I'm gonna talk about something and it's kind of opened nothing so he had Tick-Tock, right? That's stupid app that everyone is Dad away her dad or your stuff that had picked out and you know that app that's that everyone thinks it's cute school, but it's really cringey. Yeah, it took Jack.  Musically same thing reincarnation. Yeah, anyways, so she went on his account and he added a bunch of these little like 14 year old girls.  I know she is and then all of our friends from Minneapolis to do a lot of like a lot and all of her friends just do that. Can you stop putting the phone in the bowl recording this off of Timmy's crappy Android? Okay. Whoa, at least it's not an iPhone iPhone suck. They are not. Okay. Hey.  They suck they suck. Okay, and you have no other opinion. They know it same songs are good for me because their battery power is so much better and then iPhones you have iPhones their internet their internet their iPhones internet or so better their service is so much better than Androids. You want to chill out with that? Okay, then they iPhones are so overrated. They are they are there. So the diet too much. Listen I asked.  Buddy, why? Why are you happy that you'd rather? Okay, its okay. Its I was walking alone. I'm not sure. Yeah. I was walking home from school and the Skittles behind me. He's like, hey iPhone XR like that was random out of the blue moon like okay iPhones are I'm like, well, I knew him kinds of so I'm like bro iPhones are tray. I feel like as a joke. He's like nah, that's better than Samsung. I asked him why he  likes it more and he says because the sales are better nothing like that doesn't mean the what body he's basically saying that he'd rather have quantity over quality. So I don't know isn't quantity at like how much it is. Yeah bodies like how careless yeah quality or quality how good it doesn't quantity my gosh. I know how to word but a word I can English well or are you Timmy? What do you what do you want to be when you're when you're  When all said and done you want to go to college? No, I just want to not fucking be a lot. Let's just switch that okay. I don't I don't want to do anything. I just want to freaking just gonna get darker all fast, but I just have fun. Okay is everyone. All right. Okay, let's skip that because I have no idea what you said. I'm gonna talk to this about don't worry after this.  I guess I'm gonna talk to Timmy about this and he's probably gonna be bawling his eyes out because he's Timmy Timmy Timmy is not the happiest fellow just saying it but we're we're we're at we're happy now because we have friends and we have Cheez-Its. Yeah. Yeah. We have Cheez-Its. We have food and Xbox and water and water. Yeah, we're still alive. We're not in Africa rotten Africa starving.  Well water is like dark you I really want to do that too. And I helped a lot of people that I'm not talented. Well, you're going to join me someday. I will join you but yeah, I'm not talented. I can't do shit like that. It's easier to start. Honestly. The only thing I'm remotely good at is soccer really and I've that I there's nothing  No, soccer clubs and my game got canceled. Although I guess your days that was a lit. Anyways, it was in turn that radiation like we had to I don't know the other team had to Forfeit or something. What? No, I don't know. So let's talk about this music that I like. I like.  Like yeah, but I don't want some very exciting. So I was watching like live shows from Nirvana a big Nirvana injured right now. Yeah. It's about this thing about how to start a band.  Survival guys and like okay, I watched it. It was so sad, but it actually was helpful. It was like if you want to actually be in a band that wants to go somewhere just know that you won't go anywhere. You will not be a Arenas you'll not do that and then but at the end of the video it was like  Use like saying when you when you get to the point where you were you done all that and you were in your actually but the point where you're recording your own music, then you might go somewhere.  And I'm just like all right. I'm going to do it not exactly what he said.  But there is like some Wizardry behind like performance. I swear to God there's some Wizardry like is all about psychologic psychological stuff cuz  Um getting the crowd hyped up getting them like mellow getting them to participate in everything you do. It's all about. Yeah. I mean your entertainers. Yeah it is. Yeah, it's you got you do the most stupidest stuff to get attention. That's the thing also with social media bands like the music they get a lot of attention and all the stuff they do is for attention, but  If you're a person from Minnesota, that's just making music and then they're really good at it. It's weird. You're on a new lifestyle and you gotta like live with it. Yeah, very no matter how bad you feel it. Just kind of hits. You gotta get that attention get that grass. You're just going to fall hard.  Yeah. Oh good. Okay. Well, I guess things like yeah, I would love to be a musician. I'd love to be like a YouTuber as a wedding or like a streamer, but I'll see you doing I don't want to set those goals for myself because I know I'm not going to reach them like like I'm gonna end up trying like way too hard. I swear. I don't know something on those lines too hard because trihard just basically means you work.  Charge, yeah for let's try hard on this town and get a date. Yeah, it's all stupid.

If tonight we can contribute something constructive to the explanation of these phenomena.  It might be able to assure these people who have nothing to be alarmed about it first.  Seemingly since the dawn of humanity unidentified flying objects have been observed in the skies above us.  Whether it be ancient depictions of celestial beings coming down from the heavens or modern-day accounts of alien abduction, the fascination of what life exists outside of our own has captivated many imaginations over Generations.  There are countless UFO sightings to cover but I felt there was no better place to start than one of the world's most prolific cases of mass UFO sightings a case of strange sounds odd ships in the sky and so much more. This is the Unsolved Mystery of the Warminster thing.    As early as the 1930s a small town in the south west of England known as Warminster had begun to experience some truly odd happenings Warminster is a rather small town a place where everyone knows everyone strange sightings and sounds began to be reported by residents around the area. They started few and far between but gradually over the decades these reports of strange objects and sounds would increase tenfold.  There is a rather old TV documentary about the Warminster thing that I have watched in preparation for this video.  In this video many residents give firsthand testimonies describing what these sounds were like many of them said the sounds were cracking and Stark in nature. These odd Avenged would practically go on talked about into the mid-60s when the war mr. Thing seemingly made its debut on the grand scale.  In 1965 esteemed local journalist Arthur shuttle would would write his first piece about the odd events in the Warminster Journal.  He titled this small piece bail. He'll mystery weird noises on Christmas morning.  The funny thing about this article is that it was basically hidden in the middle of the page this article shared a very detailed story told to mr. Shuttle would by a local woman named Marjorie by she claims. She had woken up at around 6 a.m. Or so on Christmas morning. She got dressed and began to make her way to church for Christmas mass. And while she walked her out. She began to hear some unsettling noises in an area known as Belle Hill.  Marjorie describe these noises very odd. She said and I quote like branches being pulled over gravel.  A couple of days after Marjorie shared this story with mr. Shuttle would he would share this bizarre encounter just after the new year as mentioned before the story was pretty much shoved to the back page and practically unnoticeable ass history went though this seemingly small and insignificant story would end up being the Warminster journals. Most prolific story.  Not long after the publication of Marjorie by story many other residents began to share their own experiences upwards of 30 people sent in claims of hearing strange sounds that Christmas morning as well these stories seem to verify marjorie's claims and Arthur shuttle would began to compile all the reports. He was getting over the next year.  It seemed no matter where you looked on the Warminster Journal at the time alleged encounters with UFOs and odd sounds were everywhere.  The year of 1965 may very well hold the record for the most UFO reports in England's history.  In the months after the initial Rapport in the Warminster Journal letters continued to pour in from residents who were claiming to have experienced it many were in conjunction with the strain sound Marjorie at heard but strange sightings of unexplained shapes in the sky also began to surface.  The descriptions of these strains figures in the sky varied from metallic orbs saucers and most notably cigar-shaped spaceships.  Almost always a weird sound accompanied these sightings.  These sounds were said to sound like booming or annoying droning in some reports. People said their cars failed after seeing these odd figures in the sky others reported animals acting strangely while these encounters took place. For example, many residents reported dogs behaving very oddly.  Some residents tried to get further proof of their experiences many set up cameras and tried to get pictures of these strange figures. This is always easier said than done obviously as if it were as easy to set up a camera and take a picture of something the mystery of many folklore would be lost. Not many had any sort of luck with photographing what they dubbed the thing one resident even claimed he took pictures of the thing but his film would review a damaged burnt film role essentially claiming the thing.  Mitted energy that affected cameras contrary to that story though Gordon Faulkner who was a local factory worker who also had a hobby of taking pictures would give Arthur shuttle. What a picture he claimed to be of a UFO. This photo was published in the popular Daily Mirror given permission from Gordon to quote do as he seemed fit with it.  Gordon Faulkner would be interviewed by many reporters who wanted the scoop on how he had gotten this iconic picture Gordon seemingly enjoyed this newfound Fame and eagerly shared his information with the public.  Many people of course question the validity of Gordon's picture editors for the Daily Mirror even stated the picture could very well be a fake. There are a few audio clips of Gordon's interviews about this picture. Mr. Pullman. In fact has done much to put Warminster on the Flying Saucer map. This is how he got his picture. I had a camera with me. I was taking it down to my sister who wanted to borrow it and as I just have the camera with me.  You're like a just and didn't took a picture. The object was staying still all this time. Was it always a nervous moving but moving slowly has been fairly fast. They wouldn't let us say how fast but I couldn't say heaviness. Now. Some people have said that when they try to take a picture of one of these things there's been some mysterious force or radiation that stop camera from working. Did you find this and can stop my Canada? Where have you had people say that this picture is a fake and cause unhappiness. I mean, what do you say to them when they say  They're entitled to have an opinion. I know it's not fake and it doesn't really bother me. One of the people think.  After this Buzz things would seemingly start to die down a bit among locals, but the phenomena and continue to attract many curious tourists looking for a peek at the legendary war mr. Thing.  Many UFO researchers began to show up in the area as well the British UFO research Association also known as before AA which was a newly found a group launched just a couple of years before in 1964 had come to the area in hopes of documenting the phenomenon at this time though the number of sightings began to decrease drastically.   Although the phenomenon and seen to have calm down the town of Warminster strongly Embrace their new reputation and residents began to open UFO themed businesses, including a UFO bed and breakfast.  This Embrace of their local Legend had earned them a lesser-known nickname Roswell of the UK.  Sometime in October 1967. Well over two years after the Warminster thing phenomenon had peaked to local police officers claimed to have seen an aircraft over the town of Devon. Devon is a short drive from Warminster roughly around 2 hours or so away even less depending on the route. You take the officer shared their experience with reporters and they sounded pretty convinced that what they had seen was a UFO. Here's an audio clip of that interview.  Ali Bianca is likened unto a cross Contour Willy just said here we go online and we drove out.  After its if you know what I mean.  We're traveling very fast.  Don't know sign that I heard at all. It was was no outside that noise apart from the noise of the car itself Next Generation. The acceleration away from us was terrific. So really we didn't get under it to hear any sign. It was definitely there. It is. Definitely part of Mind by some sort of thing or remotely controlled. It was definitely being controlled to view our car.  After this the town of Warminster would quiet down once again with the occasional sighting here there.  Warminster would Skyrocket to the world stage one more time though in the mid-1970s crop circles seemingly began to appear in the region out of nowhere at first many would tie this to the strange phenomenon of the thing from 1965 others also tried to tie in the Stonehenge which was close to the area. However, many people obviously claim these crop circles were nothing more than a publicity stunt by the residents desperate for one last liver.  attention in Fortune from the thing  However, after these crop circles their seemingly has not been any Mass sightings of the Warminster thing.  With most of the witnesses now being deceased including Arthur shuttle would the man who introduced the world to the thing all those years ago.  Arthur passed away in 1996. He wrote many books about his time and experiences which can still be read Arthur shuttle would would like to claim himself as a skeptic but said he remained a Believer until the very end.

It really puts a lot of things into perspective for me.  Well, it certainly changed the life of one man the local newspaper reporter Arthur shuttle would without reservation. He believed that someone or something was trying to make contact the lot of people when I've recapped on their stories. They've had that same Sensation that they feel they feel better. That's not physically but mentally and spiritually particularly. They want to achieve something for the benefit of mankind. I don't think I ever have he's over it when you do go and feeling that's inculcated in you buy this  And I think what if you're going too far to say that you feel you've had something like a religious experience. Yes. I don't think that would be exaggerating you. Do you you seem to have a new outlook and you mental outlook on life and you want to help people this is because as most peculiar perhaps and it's almost incredible to you no doubt, but I felt that sensation. I wanted to see it again and I wanted to convince whoever was on board that we weren't antagonistic and what we want.  To warmly, welcome them if they care to land and of course they have landed they have landed.  2015 marked the 50-year anniversary of the Warminster thing Legend despite half a century passing by many UFO researchers and fans flocked to the event to show their support.  Later that same year an unknown artist painted a large mural on a concrete wall in Warminster memorializing the event that cause so much hysteria so many years ago.  Warminster England remains a rather small area with a long mysterious history around it even until this day local residents are uploading videos pictures and audio a strange lights and sounds they are experiencing in the area. Just a few years back in June of 2017 a video recorded by a resident that lives around Clay Hill where several the original encounters were reported.  This video shows an odd light in the sky seemingly repeating a circular route.  At the end of the day Warminster continues to baffle Millions around the world with its seemingly never-ending source of UFO and unexplained activity whether you believe in UFOs are not this case certainly holds weight in the greater investigation of UFOs and extraterrestrial life.  Thanks for watching this documentary detailing the strange and unsolved events of the Warminster thing. What do you think happened? Here is Warminster truly a hub for the Paranormal or is there some sort of natural explanation for this phenomenon? Either way, there are some truly weird things happening in the area.

That was working for man. He'll up to cradle Hill.  And then just past the Farmhouse. I'm Kim aware of this. I'm going anything lying in the road and was just absolutely dead scared. It's just as fear. It was just like a fog early but it was perfectly outlining. It was typical classical Flying Saucer using photographs and so on and it just lay there. What across the road  And I just went absolutely hot. I didn't know what to make of it. So it was similar to like Doctor Who's Tardis if like it was half here and half not as if it was in another dimension, but it's an incredible experience and I don't expect people to believe unless it happens to them. It's all this and I watched it right at the side right over there.  But I looked in that direction there is a silver plane and a pink one like a between a pink in a red series color then right side by side and they were in that direction and there was no play but I don't know where it went to I which is noises hell of a noise it was and King then, you know, it was a bit Misty foggy.  and  it was like as if a tin cans floating nuts and bolts in our and somebody was rattling it what I did see was a green shimmering light for Backwater an hour, but it's hard to explain just like a bright light for the red light in the middle right should get sagashi.   	This is one of the most prolific cases of mass UFO Sightings, a case of strange sounds, odd ships in the sky, and so much more.  This is the Unsolved Mystery of the Warminster Thing.

Every time I turn that game on I have fun with it. Would you agree? Yeah, I think it's great. You always have fun with it for sure. Wonderful. So we got an email from Justin on the subject of sending us an email. He wrote to us at Nintendo cartridge Society at gmail.com. Just like you can and says Patrick a mark. Hey, I've been a fan of your podcast since March of this year a long time listener to  shows like GameXplain and retro knots but when I switched over to Google podcast somehow through Google's magical algorithms your show was recommended to me and ever since that magical day. I've been listening to your podcast until I left to visit my family in Japan this summer. I admit regardless of how awesome your podcast is being in Japan. I was quickly overwhelmed with Japanese gaming stuff and entertainment and then new movie Dragon Quest your story so he didn't hear about sorry.  I'm skimming a little bit here. So I didn't hear about this Donkey Kong competition to the podcast this weekend when I was flying home and catching up on the backlog of my podcasts. Well, I decided to take you up on the Donkey Kong 3 challenge. I'm sad to say despite my love for NES and monkeys. I can only handle one night of spraying Donkey Kong with bug spray up his monkey cheeks, so I know my score isn't going to win the Epic sock prize, but I wanted to submit any way Justin. Thank you for submitting. Even if you're not super.  Proud of the high score. We appreciate seeing it interesting as something interesting to note when visiting Japan this summer. All the kids are still seem to be highly into Mario Odyssey, even though it's a game that's been out for about two years all their excitement around the game made me decide to finally pick it up. It was a game. I had previously passed on I'm happy I did this because it is so much better than Donkey Kong 3. I was wondering what your thoughts are on collectathon games in general. If you play them. Do you find yourself using guides like  YouTube videos to help you complete them or do you attempt with no help at all? I appreciate your awesome podcast Charisma and intro music. Thanks so much. Justin Mark. How do you feel about collectathon games? What's like an example of a collectathon game? So I think in this case, he's using Super Mario Odyssey is like after so many moons are like that kind of thing. Yeah, I mean because it my Odysseys, you know premise is here's a big space find all the moons in it.  I do think that Mario Odyssey is one of the best examples are like one of the most fun examples of a collectathon game because most moons require you to do something that is fun. Any way to earn it. I think the bad examples of collectathon games, you know end up being like the Nintendo 64 era rare games or ukulele from a little while back and I mean all like  Games if they're designed well, I don't think that the the genre is inherently good or inherently bad and a good one. Like there are a few things. I like more than a good collectathon game. That's very satisfying to me and I just generally I use guides for all humor game that I play like for sure. I feel so bad for guides writers. Oh, yeah because that has to be such a like grinding job.  Because the game comes out maybe you have a review copy and you know, like immediately people are trying to like take like fire emblem. For example, right? Yes. Somebody had to compile the list of what gifts go to who and like what lost items Yoda. Who and that's probably just a lot of trial and error total. Just trying to be like do it as fast as possible. Right? And who did I give that look I will use guides for for that sort of thing, but I  Also just gone up two characters in Fire Emblem three houses and try to give them everything in my inventory until they're like, oh, yeah. That was mine. Yeah, I which way I wonder which way is faster because I've always looked it up. Oh, yeah, and I wonder if it's just faster just like brute force. It - I've no penalty. No there. I mean, they'll say something like know how would you think that was mine? Some of them? Some of them will be rude about it? Yeah, but it doesn't like show that your relationship is getting worse. So like just keep trying to give them that beat-up coat. It'll be fine. Yeah. Thank you. So  Much for writing in Justin. Yes. Thank you. And for yeah, my Odyssey. Yeah, baby. That's a great game. Oh, yeah, that is a great game. Um better than Donkey Kong 3. We'll see. Alright Mark. Let's get into our topic of the week, which is the Nintendo Indie World Showcase.  Gamescom going on right now in Germany. Lots of big video game news coming out of it. This is a Nintendo's contribution to that. So it was a couple of things are a little bit different about this one previously in North America. These Indie showcases had been referred to as Mindy showcases. Yes, the Indie World Showcase seems to be a global branding the  That they had previously been using in Japan for sure. I think also in Europe then now they're just like making worldwide. I wonder if that's also why we didn't see the presenters on screen like we have previously it was all done in voiceover. Yeah. Well it's so I mean, I guess one of the bigger things that has happened since the last one of these right is that Damon Baker is now no longer he working for a Nintendo. He was around for the one in March either. He yeah that that might be true.  The timeline is messed up in the air. But I mean if there was a for that one his fingerprints were probably still on it and some capacity and it seems like this is maybe just that they're falling in line with the international branding. Yeah. I kind of missed the like personal presentation I guess. Yeah. Well, they they weirdly called it out right at the beginning because it's still hosted by Kirk Scott and Katie Casper who is not  a Nintendo personality that I was familiar with before but they point out that they're just the disembodied voices of them and not the actual personage. Yeah, but you know, whatever we still learned about like 20 games. So how do you want to do this? You want to like run down like game by game and see if we have anything to say? Yeah about let's do that. Well, first of all, how did you feel about this thing? Was it where they're exciting things in here for you? Yeah, there were there were some stuff that I hadn't heard about or wasn't familiar with or anything.  Like that. I also didn't really have any expectations for this Indie showcase because I felt like a lot of the big, you know indie games that would you kind of expect to come to a platform. They've already checked a lot of those boxes in the any good way. And so this was just kind of like, oh cool. This is like a bunch of stuff for the most part that I've never heard of. Yeah. Well and also like you and I are like super year to the ground indie game like PC Gamers anyway,  Oh, so, you know a lot of these things are the total surprises to me, which is fun. So the first game out of the box was risk of rain to from gearbox, which they described as a classic roguelike for one to four players coming out summer 2019. Yeah. So the present the trailer the presentation of it is a lot like the edge of tomorrow. Oh, yeah.  P movie that's right with Tom Cruise. I like the idea of this game. I didn't I never heard of risk of rain before this is probably a great example of what you were saying that we're not really tuned into the PC Indie scene. But so I the fact that this is the second one is a total surprise to me so friend of the shown June had mentioned to me that this game is still in beta on PC. So it'll be interesting to see how it's presented on switch Yeah, like if it's still like it.  Still in its beta form or if they're targeting like proper launch for because Summer 2019 is now right we're running out of Summer 2019, which is sad when you think about it is but let's not dwell on it. Let's not dwell dwell too much on being said, we've got other stuff to talk about the next game on the list here. It was. Oh what actually just a loop back to your live diver Pete thing. Yeah. I really like the way a presented like here are the two Co-op characters and they make a little  Grass and then get beaten and then it's like okay attempt number two, and it was just kind of a comical way to present that. I also just like the idea of a co-op like Rogue like yeah my I've never played one before so that idea seems really fun to me. Yeah and seems like it would that would be a fun way to like spend an evening is just what yeah, I'm wondering over and over again. Yeah, I guess you could probably play with like four switches in a room. Yeah. They also in like the fine print during the game.  It will also support Nintendo switch online next up was Eastward, which is a game from chuckle fish and picks pole and it's got some very pretty 16 bit Graphics looking a little bit like Earthbound a little like notes of Secret of Evermore and Chrono Trigger. It definitely has the 16-bit look but like the animations are so much more. Yeah than what you could do on a 16-bit system and it looks like it's got kind of a top-down.  Zelda like gameplay style to it. We were in someone tweeted at us about this too. Sorry. I don't have that right in front of me, but that we were just talking about Zelda like games like Blossom tail possum Tails blossoms tail blossoms Tails. I don't know. I don't know where the S is in that and yeah, this would be another example of a zelda-like game and it is coming out in 2020 and there's definitely like a part of my brain that anytime this kind of  Like art style is invoked that it just starts like yes. I want this. I want this. Yeah, it does it fills and it's just like a little bit different from most of the 16-bit style art that we see where like it's got that extra level of like meticulous pixel by pixel detail. It also just looks a little bit more like Gonzo in a way. It does look a little yes. Yeah. Absolutely. Just a little bit just a little bit crazy speaking of just a little bit crazy Freedom finger.  From wide right interactive is a music driven side-scrolling spaceship shmup and that's coming fall 2019. This game looked a little too crazy for me Mark. I don't know about you. Yeah, I mean shmups are not really my thing to begin with totally. Yeah, and then it like it. It seems neat in that. It's got like these different kinds of art styles. Like there's the one that looks very much like kind of Adult Swim animated like mid 2000s decade animation.  And then also like goes into like an 8-bit kind of style. But I mean, yeah, I my patience for side-scrolling spaceship shmups runs out pretty quick. It does look very silly. It does look very silly. Also, the they have a list of the musicians who are going to be their tracks are going to be featured in I didn't know must many of them, but they have one by the radio Department, which I thought was really interesting. I'd be super curious. I really like the radio Department.  Super curious to know what track they picked. Yeah or like a shmup like game and actually it seems like they this whole game is focused on presentation in a lot of ways. They showed off the voice cast which includes Nolan North and John DiMaggio and two others whose. Yeah, so that part of it actually reminded me not Nolan North maybe John DiMaggio wasn't in I'm thinking a mad world where like a huge selling point of that. Yes. Who's the voice of Bender? John measure? Okay. Yeah was it?  It that's probably why he I reminded you of it. But so yeah, it means that you know, they're they're showing off the names of the actors and the names of the bands that provided music for it. So like if nothing else this thing knows what image it's selling and you gotta respect it for that. So next on the in the presentation was a game called Roki. Mmm, which looks very pretty yes, but I have no idea how this game plays.  No, because it looks like it's kind of a like isometric or it was this the one that was either isometric or side-scrolling. I can't remember now, but you it just seemed like the character was moving without obstacles and like just in countering creatures. Yeah, it also had that kind of like really electric glowy. Yeah aesthetic to it that remind me a lot of a game coming later.  But also reminded me of just like is stuff we had seen before. Yeah, so it's pretty I'm interested to hear more about it, I guess and they just gave the release window of winter for it Torchlight 2 is coming to switch. This had been previously announced but now we know that it's coming on September 3rd and switch players get a free pet unicorn and a free pet yapper. Now. This is not to be confused with the yam. / who is the electric Corgi in the new?  Come on, that's right. You got to play Pokemon to get that thing. So really it's just it's Torchlight 2 which was basically a game that exploded before Diablo in popularity exploded in popularity before so this game did not actually explode. No, okay kind of like,  Satiating that itch for a Dungeon Crawler type game before Diablo 3 came out and it looks really cool. Again. It's one of those things where like it looks and plays very much like Diablo but definitely has a different personality. Yes much more like cartoony little sillier. I guess it's weird because I feel like Diablo is always toying with the idea of being silly and then it's like no no, we're self-serious and then like,  Eight, like maybe there's like a pun in the name of the sword and then it's like no no, but we're very serious next up. We saw a skater Excel from Easy Day Studios, and it seems like they are taking both the like best parts about Tony Hawk Pro Skater and skate and making a skateboarding game out of it. Yeah. So the Arcadia aspects of Tony Hawk Pro Skater. Yes is what  always appealed to me about that series that in the Rockin soundtrack. Oh, yeah, give me that gold finger baby. But and so the like with skate and later games that became more like skateboarding simulators. Yeah, that that became much more challenging for me to get into and it does actually seem like this maybe leaning a little bit more into the skate side of thing. Well whenever they're like total board control and physics-based. Yeah. Yeah, then then you know that like,  I mean total board control sounds attractive if that's something that you can actually genuinely Master right? But I mean just like a real skateboard. You have total board control on a real skateboard, but you're gonna fall most times especially if we try to do a trick this game is out. Just some time in 2020 then we have Europa. Yeah. It's a like a 3D platformer that  And of reminded me of in the little bit that we saw of Captain Toad with some like gravity stuff thrown in. Yeah, there's definitely the the gravity is is way warped that you're like walking around surfaces. Whatever reason the Avatar the character you're playing. Yeah. It was that like kind of like rounded but chunky just like AOL online. Yeah. Yeah Scott thing that becomes orange. I was watching the same like this game has to have been developed.  Or up or Montreal this game is so nerve 100% so European the but it looks cute and interesting. I noted that the world of this game seems sort of split uni, like it's vaguely post-apocalyptic and there's like some graffiti around and like you so the tagline for this was you puzzle you platform you paint Europa, which is  I don't know. It seems it seems like a cool game. I feel like in describing all of these we have sounded language like insane and also 80 years old sure. We're all like oh, yeah, you know, it's silly. I stand by it comes out comes out this winter super hot super hot and this is just super hot is coming is coming to switch. This game is been on like everything, right? Yeah. I think it's like five or six years old at this point.  It is a first person shooter with whereby the action only moves forward time only moves forward when you do so there's a lot of you know, kind of like dodging bullets in bullet time, but I guess you time.  And it also dropped on Monday. Yes is one of two stealth drops. Yes that happened around the Indie World Direct. Next up was Dungeon Defenders awakened from chronic games, which includes four players split screen. I didn't know that that was still a thing. Well, they also tee this up by saying it was like an indie classic. Yeah, but I'm not I'm not familiar with this series know neither my it looks kind of like Hack and Slash.  Dungeon Crawler, but like is actually 3D like would normally when it's a hack and hack and slash Dungeon Crawler. I think of a Diablo like game but this camera is like nice and low and seems a little bit more Action gaming. This one is a timed console exclusive timed console exclusive. So it's coming to switch first in February 20 20. I wonder if Dungeon Defenders is an indie classic and Dungeon. Defenders awakened is new  because there's yeah license was found and I think so. I think that's true. Next was the tourist which is a low poly kind of has like the Minecraft aesthetic a little bit but it's blocky characters but much more defined than like Minecraft. Yes much more detailed and it looks like it's a puzzle Adventure game in like a modern tropical setting. Yeah. So this is I wasn't sure if this is the one that the person who tweeted at us was referring to as like  A zelda-like game. I guess it's not like a 2d Zelda game to kind of remind me had like a little bit of like a wind waker Vibe. Yeah, or like a 3D Dot Game Heroes Vibe this Market remember a couple years ago when we were reading was what was the name of this comic series about it was like bird of paradise. Remember this it was like a Hawaiian detective. Yes. I do. Remember this I bet I got Vibes of that series from this game because you're playing like a guy in a  Hawaiian shirt like win a mustache and like big aviator glasses who's like exploring, you know caves and tombs and stuff. So it's got a very the the style is very specific. I don't really know what I can tie it to though. I don't know either one thing that I thought was interesting as I was watching the trailers. I was thinking of so many like young adults at this point who grew up playing Minecraft. Yeah and who that sort of like blocky aesthetic.  Would have the same sort of nostalgia that when I was talking about, you know anytime. There's that 16-bit total static. I'm super into it. I wonder if we're getting to the point where there are people who that is true for for like the look of Minecraft. Yeah. I mean, I would totally believe that and I feel like the tourist is the first game that I've seen that purposefully are not as kind of capitalizing on that. Yeah. Totally skull boy from ookami games looks like a  Real-time combat Paper Mario Os game with horror movie creatures characters. Yeah, there's skeletons and vampires and stuff like that. So if the the characters and like all the background stuff, they're all like pixelated Sprites that exists on like a 3D plane. So it's a little bit octo path travel e traveler E and A little bit Paper Mario asked also they gave a really specific.  Release date December 3rd. 2019 lock it in. You can also lock in Earth night from Cleaver soft. So this game looks amazing. Yes. It's like it really has the gameplay. Looks like it really has Sonic Vibes totally except instead of like Green Hill Zone, it's Dragon. It's like dragons flying through the air. So like sometimes this game looks like a shmup right where especially  like in the flying sections, but there are also dislike Parts where you know, you're playing as either this little girl or was it an old man like an old man. He's got a big beard. Yeah, and they're like running and dodging, you know around all I call these creatures and like weird platforms and stuff and like the game just looks so pretty has this like almost like painterly like storybook quality to  And would also go into like sort of behind the character camera when they're like diving through. I like diving back onto the planet or something. It seems wild this game seems wild. Yeah, it looks really cool. It's probably one of the games that I was most excited about. Yeah coming out of this showcase partly because you don't really see games try to ape Sonic the Hedgehog  Ugh, yeah, you definitely don't and you don't really see games going for this kind of visual style either. You know how many times we said pixelated or 16 bit or you know retro were blocky or whatever or even like animated and well this does look like it doesn't look like a cartoon. It looks like someone, you know, like very careful like colored pencil pencil drawings for like a children's book. So it looks like something  That nothing else really looks like and plays it looks like Sonic the Hedgehog which no one else really does and it's coming this year. That's right. It seems like it's going to be really cool next. They had a Sizzle reel for the Hotline Miami collection. Yes, which I thought was so funny because if you are not familiar with Hotline Miami at all. Look see what happens no idea. Yeah. It's like the trailer was basically just shots overhead shots zooming in on  really pixelated character like that game doing nothing. Yeah particular interest and granted Hotline. Miami is incredibly violent. Yes, they've shown off incredibly violent things before so I'm assuming that yeah, they just figured Hotline Miami people just know what this is. Yeah, you want it or you don't it was the other game that released on Monday? It's a both games for in one download for I think like 25 bucks. Are you  You played Hotline Miami? No. I haven't played either of them. Hey me neither, but I played Katana 0 which people say is very similar, even when I was watching the trailer for Hotline Miami the soundtrack started up and I was like, oh, yeah, this soundtrack sounds exactly like Katana 0 which is cool Katana 0 was a really cool game which again props to Earth night for not looking and sounding like everything looks and sounds then we get like a full-blown Sizzle reel for a bunch of games coming out, dude.  We just speed through these the way they sped through them. Yeah, I yeah a lot of these I don't even really particularly remember. Yeah. So Blasphemous from Team 17 digital and the game kitchen is a 2d Castlevania. Ask game. That's out September 26 2009 teen close to the Sun from wired Productions and storm in a teacup is an atmospheric first-person puzzle Adventure sometime in 2019 kept quest to which is cats running around with swords and stuff.  Fall 2019 Spirit fairer which was an action-platformer out spring 2020 train train. How would you say this trying trying for the nightmare Prince is October 8th 2019 creature in the well, which is a game that we did talk about in the March and indirect. This one actually gets a release date. So it's kind of like a pinball based hack-and-slash kind of game. It looks really cool.  I would love to see somebody who's skilled added play and I know from you would be a nightmare. But basically it seems like you're shooting these like electric orbs. Yeah, or like orbs of electric power around here and then you can do very important distinction. It's yeah, I completely the writer electric cords or orbs of electric power and then you're using your sword to kind of like bat them around Orbit on yet to be revealed. But so the release date is September 6th 2019, which is very very  And then we saw one finger death punch to don't know what that is, December 2nd 2019 best friend forever. This looks very cute. Yes. This is a dating Sim. Maybe it's a dating Sim. It has some sort of social components. But also you have a dog. Yeah, maybe you're just socializing dogs. Yeah, it could like that also would be super fun. I also just want to mention that we had I we love this is a sidebar. Yeah, we love when people send us which friend request. Yes, you can find.  Our friend codes in the show notes. Yes. I saw that one of my friends a listener was playing dream daddy and that reminded me that I need to buy that game I do as well. I feel like this game has a similar aesthetic to dream. Daddy. I think so too. That's what made me think of it. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Obviously I should have put those dots together. It's also best friend forever. It's coming out on February 14th. 2020 Valentine's Day apropos.  Very good fogs phog s exclamation mark this it's like you were down. Its a mix of like CatDog the Nicktoons young the early 2000s and snake pass. I believe I wrote It's a nightmare mix of cat dog and snake fast. Okay. So instead of being a cat and a dog, it's using to be two dogs. Yeah, right. There's no getting around the fact.  Fact that they look and move like penises. Yes. It's a problem which was not a problem with snake pass or cat dog efficiently. I don't know can't talk makes me uncomfortable. Well, we can't talk. They didn't have to use like Havok physics or whatever.  Next up is what the gulf it silly golf game doubt this winter kind or keaney. I'm not really sure. So this looked in this showing here like a moving objects around a space puzzle game it also made an appearance in the  Google stadia direct which made it clear that there are musical elements to it to wear like the pieces that you're rolling around our musical instruments and like the music changes as you move them and reconfigure them. So that actually seems a little bit more interesting to me after having seen the stadia thing. They also showed off hypercharge unboxed from digital cyber cherries a toy soldiers first person shooter coming out this winter and they and next was  Earth guard which is like a viking Viking style like tactics game September 26 2019 also spark light. This one is kind of like Blossom Tails. Yep. So another one like that fall 2019. And then the last on the sizzle reel was a Munch Sizzle reel. I don't know what I actually said Sizzle reel was the new Munchkin game quacked Quest so munchkin is a card game, right? Is that wine where I know the name from? Okay. Yeah, and they use is  It cards or Miniatures. I think it might be both because I know they also do a lot of like license stuff so that you'll see you know, like a Batman Munchkin game or whatever and this doesn't look like it's they're not just bringing a card game to switch. It looks like it's actually a video game again. I will say hack-and-slash again because that's what it looks like and that's fall 2019. And then finally there was a one more thing.  Always got to have one more thing. Yeah for Indie world and its Ori and the blind Forest Definitive Edition from Xbox game studios coming September 27th, which is very soon same day as Dragon Quest 11 s Echoes of a hope Echoes of a an elusive ages of age. Yes, if in addition  Yes, so this is a was previously an XBox exclusive but that doesn't seem to mean too much anymore. Yeah, the second time one of those games has come to switch after cop head. Yep, and also interesting around the time the cuphead was revealed. There were rumors that Ori and the blind forest was also in the works. So I have not played this game. I don't own an Xbox. I know it's super well-regarded the yeah and looks  Or at least from the trailers that we saw on Monday looks very exciting and very good. Like I'm totally going to pick this up and I just really I think it's cool to see Xbox and Nintendo working together or you know, at least like collaborating on games like this because really I you know, Nintendo said this for a long time, but Nintendo and Microsoft are both video game companies, but they don't really play in the same space anymore. Yeah, it's true and like it's interesting because I  I do think that Sony plays in the same space as both Microsoft and Nintendo in some ways like they're playing the OU you like our exclusive so you need our platform to play our exclusives like Nintendo, but they're also playing the we have powerful Hardware that can play any game just like Microsoft and maybe this is just some of my own ignorance, but I also feel like Sony makes more of an attempt especially recently to be like  Develop games for players of all ages. Yeah, where are so that Microsoft? Yeah. I mean you saw Microsoft's presentation at E3 and it was like we're making games for all kinds of Gamers that are into you know, like hypervisor Islands. Yeah, you know, like there's not really anything for families or kids on. Yeah. Yeah, and so it makes sense to me that Microsoft and Nintendo can kind of Leverage each other's strengths. Yeah. Yeah, and if it means that we get more of the not hyper violent.  Microsoft exclusives on Nintendo then. So be it or if you know eventually someday down the line we get don't want to play Gears of War. Oh, okay. Yeah game pass on Nintendo switch would be or even X cloud or any of the Microsoft Services seeing them on switch does not seem impossible doesn't seem inevitable but it seems like something that might happen and would be super cool. Alright, that was that was the new  No, not in the Indie World Showcase the Indie World Showcase Mark. Let's close this out.  I would love to hear what everyone else is excited for in this thing.

spotify:episode:6Wh4kvJjafxG9aXjh4XZUf	Hey, how are you? How you doing? Thanks for joining its jono from Seneca today in this episode. I'm going to be talking about Ceramics polymers and composite for your GCSE chemistry exam make sure you're up to speed on this unit and listen to the episode on corrosion and Alloys which will get you up to speed on using materials and that content that you need we're going to be building on that a little bit in this episode. So make  Make sure you feel confident and ready to tackle Ceramics polymers and Composites. Let's dive in so Ceramics, what are they? They are inorganic which means they're not made from carbon compounds and then nonmetallic and some examples of Ceramics are pottery and Briggs. So think about like ghosts with Demi Moore and Patrick Swayze watch it. If you haven't when they're making that like little pot thing it's all very romantic, but it's also very ceramic so bricks also Ceramics and  Another example is glass most of the glass. We users soda-lime glass which is made by heating a mixture of limestone sodium carbonate and sad that's pretty cool. There's also borosilicate a hard word to say borosilicate glass, which is Pyrex, which if you're a baker you'll know all about Pirates it's bomb and it's made by heating mixture of sand and Boron trioxide to a higher temperature then use when making sir.  Adeline glass so it's also as well as kitchen where it's also used in chemical glassware from stuff. So let's break that down two types of Ceramics. We've got clay Ceramics. So that's that Pottery that's are like ghosts and then we've also got bricks. So that's are like houses or whatever. We also have glass Ceramics. Do you remember the two types? So we have soda lime glass which is made by mixing and Limestone sodium carbonate inside and join the other type borrow, silly.  Hate glass which is Pyrex. So that's our cookware and our like lab where it's like boiling tube and stuff can be made of Pyrex to so they can withstand those high temperatures. Now, we're going to be one two polymers polymers properties are determined by the condition. It is made in and the monomers it's made from so conditions. Let's go through an example. So polyethylene comes in two different forms, depending on the conditions. It's made in we have low density polyethylene and high-density.  E-easy low density polyethylene. You want to learn a little bit more about that. I hope you do because we're getting into even more detail. It's a flexible polymer using a moderate temperature high pressure and the Catalyst all about high-density. Well, that's a rigid polymer using a lower temperature and pressure and a different catalysts. Luckily. You don't, you know details of the different categories, you know, you should ensure that they are different. Okay monomers. What are they depending on the constituent of a  Core polymer and a polymer can be Thermo soft awesome except so thermal softening polymers have individual change that are only held together by weak intermolecular forces when heated this often and can be remolded. Okay. So we've done Thermo softening. What about thermosetting? Well, thermosetting polymers have changed that a held together as a solid structure. It's because they're monomers allow Crossings to form between the chains. They are strong they are hard they are rigid and they don't soften up on him.  Eating. Okay. So those are two examples of have the different monomers that a polymer is made up of can alter its characteristics. So do we remember there's the conditions we need to make low density polyethylene.  We have a high-pressure a moderate temperature and that special thing a catalyst if you need to brush up on what Catalyst do that's covered in a separate episode to make sure you check that out really high volume exam topic Catalyst pretty much guaranteed to come up somewhere on your GCSE chemistry paper Okay, do we remember the features of thermosetting polymers?  They don't soften when they heated when they're heated. I mean clue is in the name thermoset. They're strong they're hard and they are rigid for important characteristics of thermoset polymers. Now, let's bring it back to remember those Ceramics we talked about. What are the types?  Well, we have our clay ceramic so like a brick and I pottery and then we have our glass ceramic. So I lime soda glass and are Pyrex. Okay composite composite to made up of two different materials the reinforcement which is fibers or fragments are embedded into the Matrix and the Matrix itself. And that's the material that surrounds the reinforcement acting as a barrier. Let's go through some examples to clarify things. We're going to start with cold hard concrete and concrete is a composite The Matrix is symmetric.  Mint and the reinforcement is a sand and gravel mixture. Do you want some more? Well carbon fiber that's another composite. Hey The Matrix is a polymer and the reinforcement is carbon fibers or carbon nanotubes fiberglass. Now fiberglass is a composite where the Matrix is a polymer and the reinforcement is glass fibers. So what were the two materials that composite is made from we've got reinforcements and we have the Matrix as a  mint and Matrix  so that just about covers everything that we need to cover for this topic. Hope you're feeling confident about it and good luck with all your revision and you're studying keep going the end is coming and you'll have a nice long summer after exam. So it's all not that bad. Good luck with your revision and well done for being proactive and listen to this and doing all that good stuff.

spotify:episode:6p2C8F8Yhf7QySsq4EmKLQ	This is the SM gold channel of all India radio in the program news analysis. Now, we bring you our discussion on International support to India against terrorism that participants are Ashok surgeon har former Diplomat and simran Saudi journalist. Today. We are discussing India's fight against terrorism and the growing international support that India has received in its fight against terrorism. We have also seen that post the pulwama incident, India.  Has reached out to many of the global players including the United States UK Russia, France Iran, Saudi Arabia among others and has received a lot of support in its fight against terrorism. And that's this isn't hard when you see this a widespread support that India has received and almost all the major countries in the world have come on board. They have said that we support India and its fight against terrorism not many have mentioned Pakistan, but I guess that is something that is understood that we are talking about Pakistan sponsor terrorism.  How do you translate this into concrete action for India as it goes forward one, of course is that we bring all the countries on board as far as the Indian narrative is concerned and immediately after pulwama, you know, when India had reached out to the whole International Community more than 70 countries as well as the UN Security Council also passed a resolution in favor of India criticizing condemning the terrorist attacks. And so how do we apply this pressure on Pakistan?  Pakistan as you said similar your question is how do we translate this into pressure on Pakistan so that it desist from supporting the wrist providing safe havens to terrorists and so on so forth. I think across the board if we speak about our contacts with the UN Security Council Members the United States particularly over the last two years particularly, since mr. Trump has come to office. They have been applying very strong pressure on Pakistan you would recall that.  When mr. Trump had announced the National Security strategy South Asia strategy for 2017. Then he had said that Pakistan has been supporting terrorism all the terrorists that United States has been fighting Pakistan has been supporting them tweet or 1st January you would recall that. Mr. Trump had mentioned that the United States had paid had given about more than thirty three billion dollars to Pakistan since 2001, but Pakistan had been supporting terrorism.  Um, all these many years and they had been making a fool of the United States all these years and United States has also withheld three billion dollars of Coalition support fund, which was to go to Pakistan United States is concerned they have been using they have been applying pressure these days. We know that our foreign secretary. Mr. Vijay go clay. He's in Washington DC. He has made the Secretary of State. Mr. Mike Pompeo. Both of them have issued a statement saying that Pakistan should desist from supporting.  Some more recently on the 27th of last month. We saw that the Ric meeting took place Russia India China in Busan. There was a very strong statement against terrorism that was included that was supported by all the three countries particularly the foreign minister of China 1G had said that countries which support which orchestrate or which Insight terrorists. They should be acted against so these three countries are also  very much on board before you would see that when the heart of Asia meeting had taken place in India in 2017. Also after that the brics summit had taken place in China. They're also there was a very strong condemnation of Pakistan and groups based in Pakistan. The point that I'm making is that as far as the current government is concerned since the time they have come there used all International.  For our to throw a light on the activities of Pakistan as far as its support to terrorism is concerned and most of these countries and many of these for our International Regional fora. They have come out in very strong statements and comments against Pakistan more recently after pulwama and even after our own aerial strikes on the 26th of February countries like Australia countries like France,  As United States and so many others have come out supporting India's right to engage to launch these aerial strikes for their own self defense leftist isn't what you have explained a lot of detail about the reaction of the United States the steps taken by President Trump. And as you pointed out to our listeners that the Indian foreign secretary has made the US Secretary of State and the US and India in the mes statement released have called upon Pakistan took taken.  Eat action to dismantle the tab is infrastructure. If we were to move away from the United States and the UK to the partners in the Middle East. For example, Saudi Arabia UAE and turkey. We also saw that the Prime Minister last night. He called the Crown Prince of the United Arab Emirates. He also spoke to the president of Turkey and it seems that India is making an effort to reach out beyond the traditional world powers or beyond the traditional.  Players as we step up our case also in the United Nations where Wednesday it is expected that they will take up discussions on whether Masood Azhar will finally be designated a global terrorist or not. How do you see this Outreach that India is making two players like turkey Saudi Arabia and the UAE and how helpful will this be when finally Mizzou deserves hearing for designation as a global terrorist comes up India's Outreach to the country.  Investigation for the first time over the last several decades India has excellent relations with all countries in the region for instance whether it is Saudi Arabia or with Iran United Arab Emirates or with guitar. So you name any of the countries and India has very good relations. So while these countries in the past used to be very strong supporters of Pakistan today, they are wearing towards India because they also see that  Terrorism is a big threat is a huge threat and to protect their own security. They need to collaborate with India in terms of intelligence sharing and in terms of Defense preparedness. So that is why you would see that for the first time after the OIC was established 30 years ago in 1969. India was invited as a guest of honor on the first of March. It is very significant because on the 14th of February the  The attack took place on the 26th of February the aerial strikes to on Java top and Below code took place and on the 1st of March Timothy sushma swaraj was the guest of honor at the foreign ministers meeting of the OIC 57 members of that. The invitation was extended to her by the foreign minister of UAE, and it was supported by the foreign minister of Saudi Arabia and Bangladesh. So you see  See that as far as the OIC is concerned Joe is a very important player there Saudi Arabia possibly is the most important player. So all of them want are looking at India as a growing power as a rising power and also, you know, what they had mentioned was in terms of the very cordial harmonious relations within the country also amongst different communities different faiths different beliefs different.  And religious this is what the base is social swaraj mentioned in her address. Also all these countries The Narrative of Pakistan which used to be on faith-based hate Revenge Etc that I think is not getting any great traction at the moment and in comparison to that the countries are looking at strengthening their relations with India. I would say it is first step. It is a historic step. Of course.  Us many more steps need to be taken because critics can always say that you know, there is still the contact group on Kashmir met just before that and issued a very strident statement Etc may be that we will have to take it in our stride but as the UAE foreign minister said himself that we look forward to embracing India as a member of this organization. I think this is a very significant move 1969 when OIC was established then  So far suddenly Ahmad who was our representative and would want to Rabat Morocco. He was not allowed to participate in that meeting this time. When Sachi was addressing then the foreign minister of Pakistan absented himself because he wanted that this invitation should be withdrawn but the UAE foreign minister did not agree to that and I think this is particularly significant in the context that it was taking place just a few days after the aerial strikes that had been  launched by India on the terrorists on the - Mama the holdout and training camp in Pakistan. Let's just say we've spoken about us and we've spoken in detail about West Asia the Saudi position the you a position usually brings us back when we talk about Pakistan or we talk about Masood azhar's designation as a global terrorist or we talk about the scourge of terrorism that India is facing from Pakistan is the position of China and that is a position.  Even now doesn't seem to be very clear. How do you see the Chinese standard? Do you feel that the fact that you have this resolution in the UN which is being led by France which is supported by both the United States and the United Kingdom, but China has the width veto power in the UNSC. Did you feel that China can be brought on board the indications that have been coming from China do give  Some indication that China might be willing if not exactly to support this move to Brand Masood Azhar as terrorist under one to six seven committee resolution, but it could be persuaded to abstain from there. I think the pressure that has been brought upon Pakistan and Jesse Muhammad has already accepted responsibility for launching the attack on the fort.  Till February we also know that Jesse Muhammad has been branded as a terrorist organization since 2001. So how is it that the organization has been branded but it's leader and more importantly its founder has not been on the terror list since that time China says that there is no consensus in the one to six seven committee not pointing out that it is only itself. It's only China that is stopping the consensus all the other countries.  Are very much on board in terms of branding Masood Azhar as a terrorist. So it's only China which is standing in the way and it is standing because it considers Pakistan to be its strategic Ally. It is a political Ally for a variety of reasons. You have the china-pakistan economic Corridor, which is the Mainstay, which is the most important segment of the Belton Road initiative that is going through  The Sun so it needs Pakistan's support in making that successful and there are a variety of other reasons gwadar as an element in the String of Pearls initiatives that it has launched to encircle India in a manner of speaking a variety of these things. It needs a Pakistan support. That is why it has been while all the evidence has been pointing towards Masood Azhar having perpetrated this crime and also,  Also many other terrorist attacks against India, but still China appears to be unconvinced. But this time there is some possibility because I think there is so much of international pressure after this very vicious attack in pulwama. There is pressure on Pakistan. And if China were to be seen that it is in face of all this evidence and pressure.  Then it could feel itself isolated. So there could be some possibility that it will change its stand or just abstain from this but one of the indicators towards this also is that Pakistan has mentioned recently that it would not have any objection to Masood azhar's being placed on the one to six seven list. One of the reasons could be, you know, there have been so many rumors and speculations floating around that  That Masood Azhar is very unwell his L. He might even have passed away. He might have died. No one is rarely very clear. Mehmood Qureshi. The foreign minister of Pakistan has said that he is lying in a hospital. So I think all these things will need to be taken into consideration, but whatever happens I think Pakistan and China where they act in concert with each other on whatever decision is taken. I'm just coming next few days. We will continue to follow  Actions of China and other nations at the UNSC we have Masood azhar's designation as a global terrorist will be discussed. Thank you.

India has reached out to many of the global players including the United States UK Russia, France Iran, Saudi Arabia among others and has received a lot of support in its fight against terrorism.

spotify:episode:7zd15Qptaa1rxz4QCbHotX	Welcome to the good life.  Welcome to the good life. Welcome to The Good Life.  All right.  He will be doing it you will be doing it a quarter of basic training. If you will be getting up at 5 a.m. Every morning. You will not have this phone for his first two weeks and his head it will be shaving until he is bald person for us in the midst of signing a contract their job. Please start a job with what the fuck is going on right now, and this is not a joke. So first of all, this is not a hundred percent official yet so you can't take it to the bank yet, but it is in very likely hopefully going to occur.  If I had my choice it would occur and I'm planning on spending six weeks there over the summer and why I think it's a unique opportunity that I've excited about. Okay, and it in Quantico Virginia and it's a court. Once again a quarter of military trade in his head will be shaved off and he said he says that this will be  Your heart is just that do you believe that to be true? I I would like to take back that statement that statement was taken out of context. Well, first of all, put it put it in context for us. I think working at any position in gridlock no matter whether it's the athletic staff or being a bunk counselor. Unless you're Nick Johnson is very challenging, but I do think the Marines is going to be a very challenging process, but it's a challenge that I've always looked forward to and   Okay, how did tell us you already told us this earlier, but for the loads of how do your parents feel about what were their initial reaction?  There are a hundred percent there at this point not a hundred percent on board. But as all good negotiations start go. They don't know we start positive. So it's going to take a little bit of convincing but I think I will have enough up nicely to end up there over the summer and enjoy the process. So I called OJ right away. Oh Jay. Tell me your initial reaction when you heard me. Yeah, I was I was getting ready to go to sleep. I get a call from Jake fine. I'm thinking  I just like a Patriot thing or Kanye and we're on a connected cold. Very Sean. I get the news and I don't know at first I was like, oh that's pretty cool. It's cool experience. And then we started unraveling in a little bit. We figured out that he had to shoot his head and you know, no phone and all this five am stuff and I was I was surprised and I respect the decision. I mean,  My cousin is in like a similar program, but he's graduating college and it's very tough. But I am more concerned that you haven't told Jared Bear show about the news yet. He might be the most distraught over here that first on Bernie. I don't think he I don't think he listens to this but I could be wrong doubt. He's gonna know he's he's like, what were your initial reaction?  Let me set the scene.  I was I was like OJ about to fall about to go to bed. I have my phone on do not disturb. So I missed Jason's two calls that he sent me at 12:42 and then at 12:57.  I get a text saying Kershaw is joining the military and of course my my reaction to this it shut the fuck up. It just has tfu instantly and then I got a call immediately after sending these texts and I'm joined in the since Group phone call with OJ kiss and fun and Farrah shop where they told and convinced that this is actually real and  let's just say this is a this is a  this is unexpected. As I said the least this is this is a  hard to believe but apparently the reality and I don't know if there's any I don't know if there is a more applicable or a more relevant Day Ever to receive this news other than Halloween. So, oh my God, those are  Sure.  To get on the airplane early when you board. That's a very good question that I don't know the answer to but it will have no impact either in in my decision because I feel like that's the biggest perk you just got to cut the boarding.  That has no impact on my life. You hear me? And you also probably yeah, we can hear you have ruber. I don't like it.  Oh, no, I think we lost Gruber again. No, no, we gotta figure go ahead with it stay with it. I was really positive. This is a big step and I thought it was a joke at first reaction. So I wanted to be positive and then the more I heard the more I realized you know that you want to do this Tyler so like good for you, but I mean it's a it's not going to be comparable to dim staff at all. Anivia. It will not be in any way not being anyway.  You know good for you and it's going to be it's going to be fun. You'll meet some you'll meet some really interesting people. Yeah, anyways, you know, you get like free chocolates and she'll just a lot of good little part of that when you get back. Um, Gordon Health Care. Can you give us a few lines of what the contract says Gore? Like I  It is my my my non-lawyer advice. Like my I'm not I want to preface this by saying I'm not a lawyer but my advice is Tyler do not sign this until you pass it by a lawyer. I think.  I think that.  this has the potential to  This has the potential to make you contractually obligated to serve in the military. It's not under two years active and two years reserves a hundred percent. That is a hundred percent most I've talked to this guy many times. It's not a binding again.  I think it is in your best interest to just go over this with someone who who is not trying to recruit you who has no affiliation with you know, who doesn't need to get a certain number of people recruited or anything like that who isn't working for the arms for the military who you know will can be completely objective. So I think that's your best bet. I mean it says  a line  The second line of the second page. So the first page after the cover page says  you will have begun the process that will lead towards officer candidate school and your commissioning as a second lieutenant in the United States Marine corpse so Luke, I'd embarrass yourself. So I'm not a I'm not a lieutenant in the family is true seniors not but pretty easy.  Listen, it's kind of easy to forget about that one. But uh, that's what I'm saying as I was saying.  my interpretation of that line  is that  I mean, there are two ways I guess to interpret that line and I'm going with the  This the very safe interpretation, which is if you sign it you're as it states beginning this process which needs to your commissioning. If you're selected another way to interpret it. I suppose would be you if you you're beginning the process and you may be given the opportunity.  To be commissioned and of course when you actually sign the like Commission in that part is where you would be contractually obligated, but I would never in my life sign this contract with that sucks showing. It's a lawyer. So that's that's what that's what I don't sell it to their recommended lawyer Chouteau law student.  I have some lawyers in mind.  Do you are you excited about it? Like what? What are you looking forward to exactly during this program? Because obviously there's some Prestige to joining it. We're all supportive but it's going to be really really tough. I have a three words to explain my feelings about it. You ready Jason? I'm ready. I am pumped.   Cuz it's quite an opportunity and something that I've had a long interest in for a long time and something that I'd like to do. I don't think anyone's ever heard about it. But it's a childhood dream in many ways for a lot of people and you think the type of people that will be in this program are very similar to you. I don't know. I've never met I've never met them with my life what you said you have a friend doing it. What is his background?  The friend is not committed and anyway.  The potential the potential commitment. What is he like? He's a very nice kid if you like 6 foot 5 300 250 pounds built football team player. No, he's probably I'm 510. He's probably five six. Maybe maybe one maybe one maybe 140 maybe 150 and very nice kid and similar to be in some ways and different in some other race. So I really am sad about your  Really you'll definitely get a lot of bacteria. The police are coming for you baby swimming together crimes own. You'll definitely meet a lot of great people with diverse backgrounds. I'm sure well end on this because we're all very tired of a chair. It's 2 a.m. But I think this new sort of woke us up a little bit. Yeah. I'm studying for the exam as we speak store like me to either psych exam tomorrow to what are you learning about? Talk about another body? I'm  Really great content you exam on dreams and Altered States Of Consciousness. We did that we did that last year. I'm so sorry miss you in the head of us. No, it's not a bad idea. I'm just telling you where on the don't worry. We already did we're doing like language inside. You guys are probably already did.  Um, grillak no Gruber. Why don't you go first? All right, here's some advice you do not want to you don't want to like do anything that you can get hurt. Like if during basic training. Don't be like the hero don't I don't like try to be like a martyr in a way like you have you liked it or something don't you don't want to be like the idiot just like do your job and like, you know, it's like what does it was Bellatrix a like do your job do you?  Your job your job and like just like don't you're not you're not going to be one who would like suck up to like the so I think of it like to like command you officers, you know, just kind of like, you know, just enjoy your time there and don't try to get her to come out alive. You know, Greylock will always gridlock. He's like more generations of bearish AWS very great advice. Okay, you're next.  Tyler I know this is far from - in it, but if you do follow through this I want to wish you luck and I'm not going to act like I'm some like Marine professional so I don't know much about what you're going to be doing, but I'm just going to say  I don't know like advice. I just hope you enjoy it and hope you may make it out and hope you have a good experience. No, but I need advice like well, he's on the battlefield. No, I don't think he's gonna be on the battlefield went out after the after the summer Jason. They'll be eight part series on what it's like for all the listen. We all know you've better there better be and there also will be a part of it. I was  Saying earlier like this is exactly like he's like Chris from get out where like he's doing and and the teacup I think someone did something to you and it's and I want to make it clear that we're not shitting on the Marines or the military. So we were in it you do not get offended. We are just some shots to the bone that mr. Barish, aw has decided to we're not shooting. I don't want to get like me to buy the military because I'm not saying anything anyways, and I we fully respect and we think you guys are great. Um,  The entire you check podcast supports that that's it. It just want to make that clear but gorelick any advice for Bear show. I'm not sure that I am in a position to get a lawyer to get to give him about the actual the actual boot camp and all that but uh,  My advice is do not sign that paper without showing it to a lawyer first and also to go off Jason's point.  Exactly. We are surprised because of the like the mental and physical tenacity and resilience that is needed to be in the Marines. Especially, you know, a very selective group and to be we are the Marine exactly. I mean to be some to be in that group especially as an officer is you know, a huge honor and not easy and it is incredible.  It's surprising that someone who comes off as very you know reserved.  has an interest in  being a potential leader in this type of organization. So that is that as the surprise here. Like I am is I think I think a bear show makes it through it. He'll come out a changed man. I think he'll be a moberg was saying I think you know what?  Could be good could be good. Okay, I'll give my advice and then we'll add delete this advice out of the podcast. Can you hear me? I hear ya. Unfortunately, you think that you're about to do something that might not be what a normal human is asked to do like be handcuffed by the feet and the arms and be dressed thrown into water. Don't do it.  We don't want you to die Amba secondly.  Don't do it come back to camp and if you do survive, I think you should write a book. This is just  it's I don't even know what NBA signing this is this is like the Paul George and Kawhi deal times 9 UM in terms of shock Enos.  I hope I hope you can re-sign you. I hope gym offers you first become back. That's why you and anyway.  That I cannot comment on the go she ations of that she's faster nor will I ever comments on that as it's not appropriate parking policy? Yes. Yes. Yes Daddy. It's a good stance and I guess I was thinking about this. What would Jim say so I don't know what he would say. I think he would try to be jaw dropped. I don't want to speak for Jim had.  Jimbo listen to this and that he will call you shortly to negotiate your back heel for a max deal at Greylock worth $12,000 a whole franchise tag you so you can't go to the military. I'm unrestricted on that restricted know he could breads the camera tag, very differently. Sorry.  So then I'll go to win a do. Oh my oh, no don'tdon't doled out. Please. Go back to Camp. Everyone loves you will see you at 6 .0. This is a heat tech special, baby.  Toby is not in the room right now. What is it? What is it? What is he doing? I don't know where he is. I hope close. He's probably looking to join the military right now, Toby really? Yeah, I don't know. This has been fun - I will see you at 6 .0. We'll see if anything's different Michelle and Scott do not let this happen under any circumstance. Haven't come back to Camp. All right. I'll speak to you. I will beat you.  No more media going forward just for that just for the crisper all the listeners. Yeah. Thanks, Tyler.	This week on The Good Life, the guys talk about Tyler s recent announcement that he will be joining the Marine Corps.  They discuss what it means for him, his family, and the future of the show.

Here we go. You can go yay.  Okay. So, how are you guys doing today? We're waiting for George to come back. Does anyone have any suggestions for our topic today? Hey Jordan back. Welcome. We had to have my food and I'm really hungry ex-im. I have to be eating start eating that is totally fine. I have who ban light bulbs or ban? Ballpoint pens? Okay interesting. Wait, what was that?  Light bulbs or yeah.  Yeah, apparently that that was one of their suggestions ban or ballpoint pens. If you can hear me things I can just let me know and I'll mute my mic.  Let me see but Baba where I'm looking ban light. Oh Ben Light mode on every social media. That would be an interesting debate George. One of us is in favor of light mode all the time. Use another is in favor of dark mode all the time. What do you think about that and and I could be pretty interesting.  That's interesting. Now. We need we need something with a little bit more flare country music band dogs or band cat. What do you think about that one George? Does that mean and on person buns? Yeah. One person is like we need to have been talks as pets and Heather is we need a band cats as pets. What do you think the ultimate dog?  Captivate hmm. What do you guys think? Do you guys like that idea teacher either way with finding your dog or a cat? Oh, here's an interesting one teacher should be replaced with robots. So the argument we could make without one is we say, okay, we want to replace all non Technology based classroom learning experiences with technology including replacing teachers with robots everything.  It's replaced with computers tablets and Cetera versus the other person would say no we need to go back to the basics and we need to completely get rid of computers there what's destroying the minds of students and what not and like we need to get rid of computers and go back to paper and pencil. What do you think? Do you want to do that one? All right you guys in the chat? Let let us know which one you think are you in favor of the dog vs. Cat debate or  In school one of us is super in favor of it. One of us is super opposed to it. Which one would you guys like to see?  I'm thinking a lot of pets. Yeah, it's Marta pets as I can see. Yeah, there are a lot of pets who someone said ban gaming chairs. Oh my goodness pets pets everyone can drive pets pets. Oh, come on guys this so this would be a great one. Ooh, there's an interesting idea. Everybody can drive versus only a select few people can  Drive find guys, if we getting a dog and cat debate, it's just going to be us like, how do you even argue like this her skin to make so many people mad because like if I get the band dog, so I'm like what am I gonna say? We take my rat in the holler off to this like and then like what might you do? That one is it huh? Like you're arguing one person argues that we should get rid of dogs. And is it the other person saying we should keep dogs or that we should get rid of cats.  Get rid of cats instead of you win because like, you know, I'll give you a speech other convince the audience that you're defending your position the best come.  Brother Ty cattle and oh my God, you know pets are oh there's an interesting idea. No pets versus you have to have a pet. That's that would be an interesting one. What do you think? Um, the basically one of us would defend having pets is a bad idea / says the other defends know everybody should be required to have a pet. That could also work. That would be a little bit more.  Balance but who am I gonna say and when we know I've realized that having my rat is it you want that's the point the show. Okay guys, what do you want the technology in school one or the pets debate? Which one do you guys like teachers replace teachers with robots or pet debate?  Which one band gaming gaming chairs everywhere could be worse and worse every time that's that's an idea. We had up for pi area wants to hear the stink impact of it. All right, George the debate topic for the day is Pets. The rule is this. Okay? Yeah, so we will say it like this.  A pet will be defined as an animal. So we're not talking about bugs. Okay and animal even though we know you can have bugs as pets we're just defining the terms a pet will be defined as an animal mammal or reptile or I guess of amphibian a frog whatever Turtle Etc that you but no bugs. No bugs. Obviously. Yes, and it has  Has to be one bugs it has to be an animal that requires leak air and it can't be a fish because fish pretty much require no care because they're fish now, I'm just kidding face to look like are you want let's let's just list off like, okay, let's create a list of like approved pets. So hamster snake turtle dog cat bird.  Pretty much you have a pet, but it has to be like what people would consider like a main pet. I mean fish can remain Straight Street has yeah. It has to be something that is a pet that can move about and it's not just confined to a snake. Yeah. Well snakes you can like take out something that you can like take out and move about so when you put the fish in the ocean, okay, stop it. Now what I'm saying is you're not going to take your fish out of your it has to be  An interactive pet something that if you can't physically take it out hold it and carry it around your house. Then it doesn't count. Okay. Okay, it has to be and we'll say that when you have a pet you have to interact with it Bailey is part of the rule so you can't just be like, okay. Well, I have a hamster and they just keep it in there and I put it in there every so often to make sure I'm following the law. Okay, so it's mandatory you have to interact so this is the debate.  One of us is taking in favor of that position. Everybody should have a pet. One of the approved pads that you have to interact with and you can move about we'll call it the approved pet and the other of us says no having any type of pet is bad and All Pets should be banned and will to make their position easier will say that.  We're not advocating just rounding up all the pets and executing them just from that point on no more pets. So basically as soon as your current pets, you know passed away or if you get rid of them that you can't replace them with new pets. Okay, that will make that person's position easier. So after like, you know, 10 or 20 and we're like 20 years. Nobody would have any pets anymore except for Birds because birds live forever forever.  This is Immortal birds were so outlive all huh. Anyway, how about this through 20 years anyone who still asks has Pets As to put them into the shoes Okay, because the immortal birds. All right. So there there we go. That's our proposed arguments. You do agree with the terms and conditions George. Yep. Okay, everybody in the chat kind of understand what we're talking about. All right, here we go heads.  Or tails, I will have heads. Okay. So how about this heads and you're in favor Banning pets tail? Okay. I'm in favor Banning pets. Okay. Yeah, here we go. He's Vitae else. Hey Siri flip a coin please else. Yeah. Okay. Well, so I am in favor Banning pets you are in favor of  Everybody knows been any better you're in favor of these pet requirement. I guess jawed.  George what I don't know who Jordan. Oh freak. Sorry, Jordan George. All right, guys We've ran up this show. It's about picking a silly debate topic and having each of us seriously defendant as if we actually believe that anything we say in the debate is not something we actually believe we're free to go as crazy as we want George then favor of a pet roryd virant reptilians.  Lord is in favor of a pet requirement man that you see from the website average ordered instead of charge. That's it explaining. Everybody should be required to have a pet and one of the approved pets and that it should be mandated. If you don't have a pet you will be forced by law to get one. I however and taking up the position of I think that pets are bad and they  Should be banned and you know, you know as everybody can keep their current pets. But as soon as their pets die, nobody will be able to replace them with new pets. That's my position. Are you ready? George do you want to do opening arguments First Auto one? Do you want to go first or should I go first you go ahead and go first. Okay. Okay, so yes pets are good. Okay, so basically  We know for a fact that animals can improve the well-being of humans regular Bulldogs make people happier in 99% of cases. So basically what I'm trying to say is pet will improve the overall happiness of the world though by forcing people to have pets we can you know,  it's things like depression loneliness because you know pets are friends. They can be your best friend. Some people's only friends are their pets. So people that don't have pets and are alone. They might not realize that we want that they want to pet and that it would make them happier. So by forcing them to have a pet they can see correct way of life of having a pet, you know, so  Basically, we need to we need a set of pads for everyone now. I know what you're going to say. Oh, some people are allergic to dogs. So that's why we have a huge list of available pet to ensure that there will be a pet available for someone that is allergic to certain types of animals that who is allergic to a snake. I don't think anyone is but snakes can be  Man's Best Friend second. Best friend may be second best makes a very useful as well. I mean some pets can be actually useful, you know, like cats for example, they eat little bugs around your house and you kill mice and rats that are stuck in your house. They they just good, you know, couldn't rodent what-do-you-call-it rodent control. I don't know they do they do that kind of stuff. They're good for that so we could reduce.  Illnesses that people get from having these is vermin running around their house. So yeah, I think  pets are a necessity and we should we should start this right now.  Okay, I will get my opening arguments now pets are Satan. Okay, how many times have you walked around and stepped in dog poo Okay, how many times have you had to smell a dirty litter box? How many times have you been bit by your neighbor's dog? Okay, how many times have you gone over to your friend's house and found that they had a snake.  And you are afraid of snakes Okay, how many times have you experienced a bad or negative reaction to pets every single person in the world has those experiences? Okay, what needs to happen is we need to protect people. Okay. We need to protect them from other people causing problems. Okay, those people who get those big dogs that attack other people or kill other people.  Guess what not going to be a problem because with my bill when it passes all pet will be banned. Okay. Nobody will be able to have dogs that attacked children. Nobody will be leaving their animals fecal matter in your yard or on the sidewalk where you can step on it. Okay, you won't have strange creatures roaming the neighborhood just because people didn't want to care about them but not only will not having pets be good for everybody in.  All Humans it will also be good for the animals it will save animals from being adopted into abusive homes where people don't care about them. Okay, and then they wait until they're out of their puppy or their kitten vase and then all of a sudden it's like, oh, well, I don't want this dog anymore. It's not as cute as when I bought it and then they quickly just throw it out into the street or they put it into a pound where it gets euthanized that is not the way that animals should be treated.  Stood and because humans have shown an inept irresponsibility at treating man's best friend and treating animals with kindness. We have lost our right to keep these animals and to have them if we cannot treat them right we should not take care of them at all.   All right. It is time for the freestyle debate portion of the show. Let's get right into it. All right, George you went first to go ahead and open up. So just faced with something what you just said. You said at the beginning you oh how many times have you had a bad experience with a pet or stepped in dog poop or whatever. These experiences are still going to happen like these?  The not just gonna disappear. Okay. There's still going to be donkeys don't gonna is still good. Let me dog. Poo on the floor don't last step in every day only because these are not just going to disappear. No all oh so you would Advocate putting the animals to sleep in said no I advocate for this period okay, we're what will happen is over the course of 20 years as people's animals and pets naturally die off what will happen is they're just not allowed to replace.  Place them so people will still get to spend time with the pets they love but my bill will have a slowly impact and eventually what will happen is there will be no more pets chilling out there. Where do you think these dogs going to be that's going to be dogs and cats is -3 coz we won't be breathing anymore dogs. Okay, we won't see no wild animals those so we're gonna breed and there will be wild animals that will be allowed to roam and be in their natural habitat. We're not going to go around but he'll all my friends to my point is we're still going  Have we still going to interact with these wild animal? That's no good. Not gonna be any wild animals are still gonna be there in your thing missing that want to be even one because because currently we're kind of in way controlling the population will these animals so that will take control their knowledge. They don't have a crazies and wild all those diseases. So right now, oh actually do you guys remember we have that control? That's because coyotes no BFA know if we if we  and the pets then they these pets are just going to be out in the wild instead of been our homes like just because we're not each now said we are not the only source of cats humans aren't the only source of cats and dogs. Yes, but Wildcats can go back into their natural and also right maybe why don't you know, how many stray dogs and cats are on the streets? There are so many right now exactly my point proven Channel why they're out there because people decide they don't want to take care of them anymore. But this is why we should host people there.  After the happy face, this is why I think it's okay. They won't be throwing around the streets. Let's before so many people homeless dogs and cats a donor gave we don't post you want people for would look after them because we would force them. They'd be checks exactly. What going in going around and making sure they're not destroying the well-being there and that's gonna be absurdly expensive know what you're gonna have and your think he's loving full and whenever the ever wonder sentences use know whenever the inspectors  Come around it's gonna go. No, we're I'm totally taking care of fluffy or whatever but the second the inspector is gone and you know what goes back they'll probably be people that will do the pre because people love animals we have so many volunteers will be wanting to do this for free the No No, they're doing the job properly now have dog lovers cat lovers everything going around making sure that the well-being of these cats and dogs are acceptable. Guess what not acceptable you shut up. The perfect point that there are already so many dogs and so many  That's on the streets. Okay, if people really wanted to take care of them they could open up their doors and open up their hearts to bring this animal saying but they're not okay. And do you know why that why is there so many bad owners who chose not to be good people and chose to disrespect the animals because they don't actually care about them, and that is why I think Americans and people in general. Everybody has lost their responsibilities or has lost their right to take care of pets. Bye.  Us collectively getting pets and mistreating them. Okay. Yes icon icon deny. There are people right now treat that pass by but yeah and you want to force them to have pets USA. Hey you because we want to have regulations on us. Here's another one. We will make sure that they treat the correctly. How are you going to do that again? You gonna put a camera and an inspector to select enough like I said a time and like I said, like I said already people that will actually volunteer for this because people love pets and the one  Make sure that the well-being of hats in the area of good people to monitor the pets a hundred percent of time. You will have people in one only one more time a hundred percent of the time if you if you won't miss treating your pet the science not just like you see ya when they when they come to look at your house and they'll be like, oh, yeah this yet. This cat is fine. They'll be up to see if it's like skinny if it's fit looks bad if it looks know if anything sect you the minimum requirements to make sure that their animal looks well cared for  so that the minimum minimum requirements so they don't get in trouble. But guess what George the minimum requirements is not what a dog not what a cat not with any animal deserves. They deserve the best. Okay, and we have not given them the best we have lost our right to have them. So we they deserve the best but now you just want to just get rid of them like just destroy that I don't know.  End to the cycle of torture and abuse. Okay. I'm not saying we go around up everybody's pets and take them away right now. Let the people who are still loving and caring for their pets Keith them. I'm just saying hey no more pets from this we would like you said so Ted after 20 years everyone what happens to the Past layers to a zoo. They can go after we have to set a deadline at some point after 20 years, which will only be a tiny tiny fraction of the past left literally like  less than a percent of a percent and they'll just go to a zoo or a Care Center where people will be able to take care of them. They were or maybe in 20 years, but then he will have been to be runes. There's still going to be Petty laughter. So like take care of the animals appropriately maybe at that point will be by these animals is still going to be existing. We don't just going to wipe out every single. What do you call them? The price of an option is let's just breed way way way way more of these animals require everybody to have one in.  Home including the people who don't want one including the pieces are already in hot as he key. There are already enough for everyone to have one. Yeah, you just want to put them in home some people who don't want them and who aren't going to take care of them. Do you like snakes George?  Yeah, there are people who don't like snakes but you want to require the navis honey. We don't have to force people have a snake Okay, let's take the list of available animal only animal on your list that they aren't allergic to because most the other animals have fur and let's just say they don't like steaks. Well, it looks like I'm gonna have to get over a good for a snake to have an owner who's in constant fear of them. Best thing should be in the home of somebody who cares about them or better not better yet. It should be in the wild. Why are we constantly domestic?  In pets that belong in the wild and keeping them in a little glass box. How is that better for the animal? Why not? Just stop taking wild creatures and putting them inside these containers. Why not? We just let them roam in the wild. Okay, let's stop mistreating animals. We need to end this cycle of abuse. What do you think would happen if we just started putting all these animals that we've currently got as pets Into the Wild what do you think would happen? I'm asking anyway.  They would all get killed off because they're currently domesticated. He can't just no one saying we need caught in the wild. You can understand all these animals in the wild. They will be getting killed by everything that's out there. They'll probably half the elephant has died. If you put your dog your dog outside, they probably just I'm not even being too cold and I'm not saying I'm not saying people should put their pets or put their dogs and the wild that is not what I'm saying at all.  Okay, all I'm saying is that people just listen to this they have until their pets that they have died off which will in 20 years again, that's going to be over 99.9% of pets. Okay, and then the remainder of the pets can go to live out the rest of their lives in facilities where they will be taking care of by volunteers and which know how many facilities we will need to know how many pets there are there so many pets do we need to be of the House of me one of these are really any because it's lovely in 20 years.  Because during any time is the would not do many animal because people will not only one have enough people to the cops of them. Probably like he allowed to get any pets. No. Yes, you can't just say no. Well, you suck. Yeah, you're advocating literally taking animals forcing you on everything we're seeing people but was don't with them not have pets. Look. I'm not saying it's bad for people to not want pets. But I'm saying having somebody who doesn't want a pet or eat them all the cool whatever quieter for it. There are people  That have you know, like guide dogs. They need those dogs how you just going to take them away that I wouldn't consider a pet. I would consider that that is but that is an option of life. I'm not gonna take away somebody's heart rate about it. Sounds like you want to take away now by dog guide on you so many time people like just having to like without that guy. That's that's an animal as utility. Those people are exempt.  Yeah, there's some people who turn their guide dogs into pets. But if you needed animal for assistance, then that animal would be exempt from that. Well, there are some people that are more like an assistant. Well, you're gonna say the same what should we be quiet rotary's are you saying secretaries the same as guide? I'm staying that secretary provided work by guide dogs not advocating getting rid of eyes of this is looking pretty good some bad, but one bad no, I want to end the Pete away.  Getting some got hungry or using the USA like guide dogs out of the equation. But what about people that have dogs but you know for depression purposes, they have comfort dogs that are this there. So those dogs are demanding an important role that again. I think if you can these dogs are also even can show that you have a genuine need for an animal like that that guess what it's now not necessarily a pet so much. It might still be considered a pet by that person but it also serves  serves a function and a working function. So it's a working animal and I would say that any working animal would be exempt from the policy.  It's the alike. Otherwise, I might as well be banning dishwashers and whatnot. Like that's come on George, but the point is people answer me this charge. Do you think people collectively as a whole had been treating animals with the care and respect they deserve I was a ho do you imagine answer the question? Do you think the animals are being treated hope? Yes, they are.  Okay, well held that all the dogs and all the cats that have been thrown out onto the street or well then they wouldn't just be on the streets. There are people that get who want. There are people get together still many more Tools in they consider their lesson. There are still people right now, they get pets without considering the full kind of responsibility that they require.  So once they get them like oh, I don't want this one. They just throw it out though.  Exactly that's gonna happen to now when that happens that's person. When you to happen, then we can reallocate that pet to a person to another home of somebody who's not going to want it or take care of it. Let me know our pets but also they won't have a choice though have to like it and know how no matter what you'll instead happen. This is what's gonna happen with your policy. Somebody is going to get a puppy Okay and then go back. Well, I have to get a dog.  All right have to I have to get a pet. So I'll just get a puppy that I really like they'll have the puppy tell us out of its puppy phase and then they'll put it into a pound which is going to make the dog really obscure the word. I won't be home the new they'll meet the same policy. Just getting a new puppy and the rinse and repeat where they will continue to get rid of the dog because they don't want to do with it when it's big but get rid of the dog every time it gets out of its puppy face and they'll put it in the pan and then somebody else will buy your law.  Ha be given that dog who maybe they won't want to take care of it either. Okay, because they won't have grown up with it and it's puppy for you. So they just don't want to have pets but you're requiring them to have one why continue to put dogs through that stressful situation. There are already many more dogs and remove the thing is an animal because they'll have to keep the pet by the law.  I said have them just keep that dog and mistreated. They were they won't be rather than I had ever got messed up. We're gonna have checks and sure that they're being treated correctly.  Okay. Well those checks are not going to be sufficient in my opinion. I don't think you're going to be because you're not going to be able to watch the pets and the Animals a hundred percent of the time. You're not going to be able to see when the person hits their animal. Okay, you're not going to be able to see the emotional abuse because the owner just keeps their animal in a cage 24/7 or got not going to be able to see any of that. Okay. Well, at least I'm the inspector told without it won't be announced will be random. It'll just knock on the door. Yeah. Well, no, I don't beat you'll be someone there's here with.  Uniformity than I know it won't be it won't be someone in uniform just be someone knocking on the door. You don't know. Is it a delivery? I don't know. Oh, yeah, that's your business. I'm gonna figure that. I don't know and what are you gonna do about? What are you gonna do? You gonna find the person so even if you find them how does that repair the emotional abuse in the emotional damage that was done to the animal? How does that make it a little bit of a be a bit of a phase at the beginning where? Yes, the pets may have a bit of a  Poor experience, but as people realize that they're going to get fine and the final go up and up each time. So let's say the first time you get find maybe a hundred of us the next time thousand dollars. Okay, you are not going to want to risk treating their pets badly because they will just go bankrupt because of it now. So basically just gets we were in the same way that people work their way around other types of finds. I not in this one thing right and how would you get around of them people Jordans? We will have unannounced  People turning up and making sure you're getting them correctly. And if you're not yet fine a fat fine, and for a lot of people they can't afford to have that so they will instead look after their pet because it will be more they will mix and make sense to do that through the motions required and as a whole moon race will become nicer race because we will be like, oh, yes ever will be becoming nicer towards animals. Why?  Should we care about the people who have been taking advantage and abusing these animals for years and years and years? Okay, they don't deserve the kindness and the loving care that these animals have been returning despite the abuse and the mistreatment. Okay humans have lost their right to have pets to have these loving caring animals in their home.  Due to their constant mystery that mistreatment if we did not I would not be advocating this position if I felt like humans been trying to work on it, but clearly we have not clearly. They're still way too much abuse way too many animals being put in pounds and in shelters and being put to sleep. I I say enough is enough animals and pets deserve better this but others believe in us this isn't gonna happen because  people will be looking after their pets because they won't want to retain people that are losing all that money to fines.  People will not be losing money just so they will. Oh, yeah, let's just abuse my animals for no reason.  Because they're going to get charged a lot of money for doing that is they're not going to do it anymore. Now, you want the single people. You just said no, you can't just you know, you want the same people who have been used only you know that for you were gonna go find a $20 hat. Then you would treat the pet pocket good, you know is somebody who just goes through the motions and making sure their pet is well groomed and well well cared for as far as like exercise and and properly fed. Is that really all  Takes to take care of a pet or is there an emotional attachment and investment emotionally that also has to go through where your pet needs to know that you love and you care for it as well. I think there's more to it if your parents literally just make sure you were fed and clothed and make sure you were healthy and that you had gone to school but you had no emotional connection to them. Is that enough for you or you going to be satisfied with that? No, you're not and that's all that people are going to be.  Giving to these animals that they're being required to care for it. They're not going to be giving them the emotional investment required because they don't want to have them anyway, okay, or they only want to have them when they're a cute puppy or kitten. Okay. Now you're requiring those people to take care of their pets for longer guess what's going to happen? There will be a bunch of animals who will be emotionally starved and I am a hundred and ten percent against that I don't want to see any animals in that situation. Well, then I propose hmm.  sessions where you must take your pet to and you must engage in  activities with your pets though, they'll be I don't know they'll be little enter around different cities and you can just take your going to have to take a pashtun ache in your hamster there. Yes, you have to take your pet. They'll be specialized centers for each kind of animal and you're going to take your pepper and they'll be fun activity setup and I'll be so fun. Everyone's everybody's going to be required as your pet there. How will be fun? How are you?  We haven't worked this bit out. Yeah, it could be a well. It sounds a lot more working out because even if you mandated the exact details and not to necessary to know right now about let's say we manage the general. Oh, look, I take my pet there once a month and spend a couple hours with it there and then it goes right back at home into another emotionally abusive situation and maybe was that all bad and said, oh boy, I got that one out online system where you can basically we have you know, like hey, I  Are you plug your camera into and they can detect if you are being affectionate towards animals, then you have just lost like camera is a come out of time everybody else. Yeah, that is beyond the scope of the the idea of your purpose lesson lesson. It's perfectly safe. The the data will not be the natural video day to be on camera. We fired our cameras in their homes for video data will not transfer third outside of the  Home. Yeah. Okay. Sure. It's that K will be first I thought well, we the software will be written by you know, like a reputable Source such as I don't know who Google Google exactly. Now, you're going down a company known as a rabbi software will be open source. Okay, it will be able to be checked by everyone. Okay, we will ensure that.  Yeah checked under the video. I defied no Reba, no will be a working model and agile that it was just online but something he if it's not going to be transferred outside people will be on just text but something over the camera. How are you going to mandate this now? You have to ask you to see it since of hacks holies have to come down to make sure you're not covering up your cam new because the software will be able to detect if you're doing that.  There's just going to be monitoring your home a hundred percent. I thought it went that doesn't sound like a bad idea at all who is just monitoring for a very specific activity. Yeah, which is Lyra interesting to be filming and recording it in case it gets the data wrong. So you want something in your home. It will just be recording and ensuring that you are interacting with your animals Corral does it's no problem because you does still have people who just don't care and they will mistreat their animal.  Okay, or they will just do the bare minimum. They might go through the motions without putting any of this particular to the anime gonna surf better. Okay, is that gonna do something again? Things are gonna go put in jail, and they won't be able to they were both living anymore say they'll be executed. I said they were no I would never get X I just said they would be fined and put in jail executed. Okay, so basically  Ali all right guys, here we go. So it's time for closing arguments. Wow. Are you ready George to give D'Elia closing arguments? Okay, we're gonna deliver closing arguments and then we'll put up a poll. Here we go. So George you want to go first or second I go second and yeah you get a closing argument was here first.  Okay. I am not arguing that pets are not a good thing. I am arguing that humans have mistreated them for years and years. Yes, some people do take care of their animals, but the overwhelming fact is there are so many animals that are mistreated on a day-to-day basis by their owners, bye-bye.  People who just want them when they're cute and get rid of them the second they get older and those animals get shipped off to pounds and they get put to sleep because there aren't enough people going out and adopting them and simply taking those animals from that situation and putting them in another home with somebody who isn't going to love and care about them and it's just going to keep them as a requirement in order to not get fined is not a better situation animals deserve.  Better animals deserve true kindness. They deserve true love true compassion true caring true nurturing. They deserve a truth and a reality that humans have not all been providing them. We have not been fulfilling our obligation. Okay, we have not been taking care of these animals to the degree that they need to be taken care of. And because of that we have forfeited are right my opinion, too.  You have these animals. We have lost our responsibility maybe after years 30 years, whatever after we have gone without them. Maybe we will we will be able to treat it as the responsibility it is. Maybe we'll be able to recognize based on what we've lost that this is something we need to take seriously and maybe then we can have another go at it. But right now we're not fulfilling that role. We are not fulfilling that obligation. I want to protect.  Pat's I want to protect the animals and that is why we need to ban them. That is why we have a 20-year phase-out period And then after that very very very small percentage of animals can be put in care facilities where they can get love and attention Okay not put in cold harsh adoption and basically kill centers where animals are put in when they get super old and the people who adopted them just too tired of them. Okay. I'm a hundred percent against that tree.  Amount of animals and that is why I'm in favor by position that we need to ban pets in order to protect the animals from this abuse.  Okay. Well based on what I said in my earlier arguments, it's actually going to be a lot safer for pets and animals if we force everyone to have these pets because we're going to have the the inspectors that make sure you're treating them good. We're going to have the AR a software that's going to be ensuring that you're interacting with them. There's going to be all these systems put in place they're going to ensure  That the pets are treated well and not just well, they're treated good. Okay, they will probably actually increase the the average pets Quality of Life by doing this. Okay, because they'll be we're going so many pets off the streets and into homes that whether they like it or not. They will be treating them nicely. Okay?  So basically pets and animals are going to have a better life after all these systems are put into place and a people actually realize that they enjoy having a pet when before they didn't know because they had never had one before and then even humans lives will be improved. So basically, I think this is a very good idea and  and everyone should have pets the end.  am I passed argument response to that is Georgia's Position will start in this position will advocate for  the bare minimum care in order to not get in trouble and animals and pets deserve more than the bare minimum. They deserve the best and I and my argument which is a poor argument because I did say that that wouldn't happen. But okay. Alright. Well. Alright guys, I'm supposed to Paul on Twitter as a response replied.  Last week remember vote for who you think defended their position the best not just who you personally like the most I'm going to post it. It's been for George myself tie or if you missed the debate, but for that here we go. I'm going to go ahead and post it absence of games and it does not put us now we have time. Yes, we're going to play a song when we get back. We'll look at the results. You have five minutes to vote every go vote for me as a reply to my latest tweet go luck at sea.  It's of games. You can see it everybody give up turn it up. My name is Jesse. My name is Adam away from Ben Maroon 5 older hit.  I'm alive everybody and we're back and let's go ahead and check the pull. Oh George, you lost 15% party 52% You guys are awesome. Thank you. I'm pretty see you guys supporting my better arguments. What do you what do you think about that George?  Did you think at the start that you had the easier section to defend? Well, I don't know. I think I don't know. I think sometimes it's easier to defend the the side. That is I guess more stupid. I think what it's like where's Lee absurd I guess is as good as for Monty as I think you and I when I first I know foods for the about and 16 I wasn't  I wasn't thinking that everyone will be forced to have a pet. I was thinking that would just not forced to not have a pet. You know, which made it a bit. Well a lot harder because everyone has to have a pet instead of just arguing against you saying that it was shouldn't have a pet. They're both very absurd positions, but I think you did a pretty good job. I think my my emotional appeals in arguments were  Really hit with a lot of people because there was there was a lot of Truth to what I was saying as far as there are a lot of people, you know, don't take care of their owner. Sorry don't get their pets. But you also said a lot of truth in your position and then there are people who, you know could benefit a lot from having a pet and it could soften you their hard exterior. So I think that we both said a lot of Truth in our arguments, but at the end of the day, you know the people  I didn't favorite me George. Don't worry. You'll win one of these someday maybe eventually I promise George that as soon as soon as he won one. I think you can he wouldn't have to be in him anymore. So so he was like today's the day that I'm gonna win this one and now we will get pretty good. You did good charge. This was this one was would have been a hard one. No results. It says 17 249. That's quite a bit of a  An L but it's okay. Well, I just I did it start. I thought I'd just toast just because I was like, how am I gonna defend, you know people not being able to have like a pet but it makes it whereas fun. It was a good debate. You did a great job George Siri. Definitely a fun person to debate with thank you. I'm funnest. Yeah the most pointless anyway guys  Thank you for tuning in to the debate podcast.

I don't like it before we discuss that we have a huge NBA game Primetime ESPN 9:30 Eastern $7.99. You can join us visit Bedouins 30.com to do so.  Okay.  Let's talk about it.  The quarterback position although a very important position is not the most important position on the field.  The most important position on the field it's the running back.  the running back position leads to the success of offenses  When you look at the Baltimore Ravens who we saw last night, it's pretty clear Mark Ingram is the best running back in the NFL currently. He might not have the most yards from scrimmage. He might he might not have the most receiving yards.  But Mark Ingram for that offense in that team.  As far as efficiency goes marking on his hands down the best running back in the NFL. That's why the Saints are the biggest losers in this whole thing.  They didn't let Mark Ingram walk Mark. Ingram just said I'm not going to talk to anybody and and bolt it.  Right. He didn't he even talked to the Saints about resigning. He just left that was the biggest loss of the offseason. So today the goal is to get you to understand why the running back is a most important position.  And to look at some teams that have had success this year and teams that have not had success this year.  Let's start out by explaining why the running back position is so important.  when you look at the New England Patriots  playoff run Super Bowl run they were able to run the ball.  They use Burkhead. They use James White, Michelle.  The three-headed monster and they ran the ball on football teams.  And they won the Super Bowl.  It wasn't Tom Brady who won that Super Bowl in fact.  T' a couple years ago when they came back on Atlanta.  They gave Tom Brady MVP. The MVP was not Tom Brady.  The MVP was James White.  Go back and go back and look at James White stats in that game and tell me why he didn't win the MVP.  Moving on. Let's look at successful teams in the NFL.  And teams that haven't had success this year and let's start with successful teams the Ravens they can run the ball Mark Ingram the 49ers. They can run the ball most dirt Coleman barriga.  The Rams an unknown coming into the into the season Todd Gurley.  Recently, they've been able to run the ball the Titans they've been able to run the ball.  The Colts early in the season had success even though Andrew Luck went out. Well, how did they have success Marlon Mac? They were able to run the ball.  the Panthers  they had success midseason early mid season McCaffrey was able to run the ball McCaffrey really hasn't played great recently. Not really his fault. They have no offensive weapons. Really DJ more McCaffrey.  right  That's why these great teams. They have multiple ways to gain yardage. And that was originally the Titans fault. I want to look at the Titans for a second the Titans. They they didn't have a quarterback who could really pass the ball. Okay, that's the bottom line. So teams were stacking the box and Derrick Henry couldn't run the ball. So it's like well are the Titans any good now they stink.  They got no offense.  But now that they've inserted Ryan Tannehill.  The guy is has even become a dual threat to an extent.  Now guys have to respect that pass game which opens up the most important part when trying to gain yardage in football the Run game and that's why the Titans have been successful. Now, let's look at teams who you'd expect to be successful, but haven't quite gotten over that hump. And really I want to hone in on the Houston Texans. Okay. This team is incredibly talented. They really should have more wins than they do and they definitely shouldn't be losing.  Going to the Broncos, you know, 38 224 whatever the score was, right? It shouldn't happen. But the bottom line is they don't really have success running the ball with Carlos Hyde. They don't really have a running back that they can rely on if for whatever reason teams are or in some sort of nickel coverage right where their dbe's are locking receivers down. They're not going to say, oh we're getting locked down. Let's go ahead and run the ball.  Right. That's why they haven't been successful the Jaguars.  Right, but they haven't been successful. They they can't run the ball. They can't they've had they've had trouble finding a quarterback.  The Dallas Cowboys, right Ezekiel Elliott gets the big contract maybe doesn't have that much, you know in his mind to play for now that he's made the money.  They haven't been successful because guess what he's not been able to run the ball the Eagles.  How did they have success late in that game against the Giants?  They were able to get production out of Boston Scott a running back.  Right the eagles found they found something in Boston Scott.  They found something in Boston's got they're going to get Jordan Howard back.  so  You know if the cow if the Cowboys can't get Ezekiel Elliott to play like Ezekiel Elliott. They won't they won't make the playoffs. They won't win the division. They won't make the playoffs. The only way they make the playoffs at a time when the division the Giants they really haven't been successful this year because they can't run the ball SE Kwang Barclays had a down year.  right the Vikings  Dalvin cook has been injured.  You know, we haven't really seen Dalvin cook play, but now that we have and we understand that this guy's an elite running back.  And they can run the ball. They're they're they're successful.  Packers, it's it's Aaron Rodgers. Plus, it's Aaron Jones.  Right and then the biggest loss of the Season, you know, you guys want to talk about well, we all know it's coming, right? Who is that big Superstar? Who's that star that key player that gets injured that costs at a team a season right? It's happened and you're saying what who who went down there's  Let me tell you Richard penny for the Seattle Seahawks.  That has got to be the biggest loss for any team this season.  He was given them phenomenal production.  One of the better backs in League the last three games because they really they really failed to use him properly the first half of the season.  And they were able to be successful and that's how you know that they're an elite team an elite level team the Seattle Seahawks.  That whole division is an elite is full of elite level teams.  But his loss that's going to cost the Seattle Seahawks some games. It might it might be in the regular season in might be in the playoffs. But at the end of the at the end of the day.  That's the biggest loss in the NFL this year.  Because not only do you lose him, but now you're relying on Carson to carry the entire workload because for so precise, you know, it's doubtful that you're going to get any sort of real production out of him.  So today's lesson obviously.  Is just how important the running back position is when you're betting on NFL games.  Because you want that run game for your team to have success.  And you really need to start focusing in on not the quarterback.  necessarily but the running back  and if you project that hey, I don't think this running backs going to play. Well, I wouldn't bet on that team right? I would not bet on that team that week.  So I think I think it's a very interesting perspective to focus in on the running back instead of the quarterback and it's one that will get you a lot more wins because guess what people do not focus on the running back position as much as the quarterback. They really do not  But luckily you listen to this podcast and I want to thank you for listening and you can follow us on Instagram at better wins 30 our next podcast should come Monday morning and let's get ready for some Monday Night Football. Hope to see you then.	We're going to be discussing NFL bedding and who is the most important position on the team that you need to look out for there's been a misconception that the quarterback position is the most important position on the field.  The only way they make the playoffs at a time when the division the Giants they really haven't been successful this year because they can't run the ball SE Kwang Barclays had a down year.
spotify:episode:0DKARHBAz6GNwwIBz9Y4Sk	Hey heaters, it's Daisy and Abby and we are the eater girls. So today's podcast because it's our last podcast of October. We decided to have a more spooky topic. So we will be talking about fear today Daisy. I wanted to ask you what is your biggest fear? I think my biggest fear. I've thought about this for a little bit and it's about getting behind and I've tied it to the idea of not having enough time. So I rush and I panic and then it's caused a lot of  of anxiety in my life. When I look at back at things that have really made me anxious. I'm like, oh this is because I just had this fear that I didn't have enough time to do something. And so it makes me really a different person. Yeah, so I think I let it consume me, but what about you mine's actually very similar. We did not talk about these beforehand mines. Basically, I have this weird fear that I'm not doing enough at the moment and that's basically what this and I kind of compare myself to other people and I'm like, well this person is doing this and I could be doing a lot more. So what  What can I be doing? I kind of get that fear also a side note of what I'm afraid of kidnap being kidnapped is probably the biggest one but in a much more real sense, it's going like I'm not accomplishing enough for giving enough that really ties in with the time thing because it says it yeah, we should be having something done. Yeah. It's yeah it's which is not necessarily true. But that's what we're that we are very similar. Yes. And so I think I found the super interesting because in a book we've both read called flourish by Martin EP seligmann, he's a  Psychologist for positive psychology. Yeah, really cool idea super cool idea that we would definitely recommend this book. But basically he talks about the fact that the body creates fear and it's not real but when I say it's not real, I mean everyone has this but it's something where we either say yes or no to it in our brain socket and it's not a tangible thing and it's not necessarily an alignment with reality itself. And so I think that makes it really interesting in that we have the ability to  Use this material it and control it the better for the better rather than to let it consume us and change our ways and make us hesitant all around y-yes curl up in a ball. We found this Huffington Post article about the dick three different uses of fear while we shouldn't be afraid of it and how courage and fear go hand in hand. It's super interesting because it's kind of goes along with what Martin epe Solomon writes about fear and how we convince ourselves of it and how we can actually utilize it.  Better of ourselves, but I love this quote. I came to understand that fear doesn't negate courage it beckons it because it's like saying that that fear is not a sign of what you shouldn't do. It's a sign of what needs to change or what you should be like pressing yourself. Yeah. It's a call to action. Yeah, and it gives you opportunity to be that courageous person where if you weren't afraid of something you would never know that it was actually like something you could have done and then they talked kind of talk about the fight or flight response and it's the eye  Dia of fear keeps us safe in a lot of situations like you and I are both very aware of where we are at night and looking around to different people and making sure we're safe and that fear Keeps Us Alive everyday. Yes, but at the same time that fear makes us do things that we are very comfortable with which is very dangerous thing because that's where there's no progression in that and that becomes something that's like habituation. Yeah, so the idea of habituation  In the psychology today article talks about how it's when our nervous system returns to a more comfortable state, which is a good thing. When you happen to be in a very dangerous situation, once you return to this state of habituation, then you know that your body has calmed down but then we don't go outside and explore to a mode and we can go on autopilot and then then we're not as aware that we're doing it because we're just naturally doing it. So I think that that ties a lot too.  The idea that fear is necessary. So it is necessary. It's just a matter of what you're acknowledging about controlling. Yes. So I think if you don't acknowledge it and you don't say, oh I'm actually afraid of this and that's why I have this right. Right, right. I'm doing this be honest with yourself. Yes. You have to be honest with yourself. I have a huge fear. Like you said earlier about kidnapping. Yeah. I've been in some strange situations walking places by myself where it's just been like this is not safe and I can tell that something's off, but I've realized that fear pushed me to be  We in to kickbox, right? I took women's self-defense classes all throughout high school and I still am really in the kickboxing during my training is one of my best friends because she just has given me so much faith in myself right where I can protect myself and that fear which is all driven by your yeah. It's knowledge meant of your fear and your ability to control it in a way that makes your life more positive. Yes, and I think another idea that this Psychology today article brings up. Is that being exposed to more things? Yes allows you to have this  Control and Pad this awareness. So going out and seeing things that you're more afraid of or being in situations that you're more afraid of wouldn't that isn't necessarily mean walking in a dark alley? No. Oh not at all afraid. It's like doing going somewhere that you wouldn't think that you would have gone Yourself by yourself or something traveling alone, but knowing that you have at least some of the abilities to protect yourself right? I know I can protect myself in these.  Ways and if that doesn't work out at least I gave it my shot and I wasn't living in fear, right walking around as if I couldn't live on my own but the thing is you never know. If you are able to overcome that fear. If you never expose yourself to different situations and new situations, which is so important to Daisy and I be yeah, and I think a lot of times people because they fear something they Shield themselves from it. They don't want to know what's out there or what could happen because they don't want to experience the other end of that was but you have to expose yourself.  Cuz that's what gives you the opportunity to flourish in a much bigger in the outside world. So there's has to be this balance of like, okay, what is real what's reality? And what's my fear? And where do they come together? And where do they completely miss one another and I think when we talk about something like exposure, we also want to think about the fact that you have to be able to experiment with yourself. Yes and understand your body so that you can not be afraid of or in the case of the self-defense thing. It's like you have to be able to put yourself out there and  Really give it your all in order to know how strong you can be and how you actually can protect yourself. It just applies to so many different areas of life and you just have to assess what that fear is for yourself. Yeah before you can actually show forth, which is one of the hardest parts of overcoming fear because admitting fear to yourself is scary foot and I got anything for your own fear to um, yeah. I think this summer was the time that I was most afraid of not doing enough and my sister just sat me down and  Said hey AB, you are 19 years old you can chill out and she just put that reality Matt head and said stop being afraid of what you're not doing. So I went to a person like kind of like a hypnotherapist. She was explained to me. Yeah, you're tied to this like anxious thing about time. It was a patient and like you're rushing and you're panicking. Sometimes you have to stand there and take a full deep breath. Yeah and realize it's okay. I don't have actually two minutes. It's gonna  Fine, but I feel like we both got the same kind of advice for that which is take a chill pill which I think Daisy and I have a real talk about it. We commonly get that phrase but one more quote that I wanted to bring up is from one of my favorite books and it's about a man who survived the Holocaust and so most of the book is his discussion of the events that occurred and his reflection on them and it talks a lot about the meaning of life and after going through the Holocaust obviously he survived it, too.  in this book and he said fundamentally there for any man can even under such circumstances decide what shall become of him mentally and spiritually and I think that was really powerful to me because it said that he went through one of the biggest travesties and thing and he still said I could decide What Becomes of me now even though there's a million things I could have been afraid of but now is my time to decide what I'm going to do with that fear and  Going to do with that fear that lives with me even though I'm not in that concentration camp like I can decide I think that was so moving. I think when you give an excuse for why that fear is acceptable to consume you right? You're not in alignment with yourself. You don't want the best for yourself that moment for some reason and so that's a great example. You've been through it. All there is every excuse in the world. He's like been through don't you don't even like this person probably has all grounds to say. Yeah. I'm going to be afraid the rest of my life and no one would bother him about that but  He's saying I've done the I've experienced this and we can all overcome fear and we can make ourselves better people mentally and spiritually and not that that's conquering fear. Yes. So I think this relates to the eater girls mentality and that confidence can be really questioned or diminished when we let fears consume has and let them take on reality and in general your life is going to be better when you're able to acknowledge these fears so that you're able to use them to your advantage.  And become better and push yourself even further because you acknowledge. What is stopping you right super important. So we want to leave you guys with a question to ponder until our next podcast. How can you start managing fear in a way that makes you more productive tune in next week eaters.	Hey eaters!!  To commemorate spooky season, this week's podcast will make you reevaluate your deepest darkest fears!
spotify:episode:6HCkjrz6JxM6wgNp88efFz	   All right, ladies and Gentlemen, let's talk about none other than Dragon Ball Z Kakarot. If you don't know Dragon Ball Z Kakarot is being published by Bandai Namco and not necessarily developed by them is actually been developed by the same Developers for some of the Naruto games now Dragon Ball Z Kakarot game is going to be as we saw with the interview with the IGN. They say there's going to be very faithful to the Anime version of the Dragon Ball Z that's going to be all about basically the whole story that's going to follow that story arc. Honestly, the art the whole art direction of the video game looks fantastic the gameplay demo that we saw with IGN it was so so amazing. We saw that basically, you know cat courts are even moves that there's so much details.  Hang on it was really a happy thing. I didn't expect that. The whole world was huge. However, however, Wally was really amazing. We saw even a scene where Goku uses his tail. I don't know where he got that. He puts it back into his hole to fish for some reason. I don't know how he can have control over it when he cut it off but still it was really really cool that you know, we saw this game we saw some of the Frieza Saga scenes and was really good but  There were some things that we were asked, you know, they asked the whole developers. First of all, they asked like Goku is out of commission in a lot of the Dragon Ball Z because you know, he's the main protagonist is suddenly comes back. So when he's out of commission what's going to happen or we're not going to play as him or what's going to happen here? They said that basically you're going to play as some other character for the time that Goku is not there and they said that  you know, we're going to do our best to be faithful to the anime at the same time. There was something that I thought was really really cool that they talking about. They said that you know, since Goku loves to eat this eating is not something like, you know other video games where you get a buff for a few minutes or something like that. It's actually actually matters how much you eat or what you eat to make Goku really powerful for the next fight in terms of basically.  The story and whatever happens is their basic gameplay actually in terms of gameplay. We saw that it looks kind of similar to Dragon Ball Xenoverse, but it does look something like that. But the same time it's Unique to itself. The art direction is actually fantastic. I think I love the art direction of this game. We saw a boss fight with Raditz though that boss fight wasn't something that I was really excited about mainly because  Rabbit season do anything. He was just taking the blows which is actually kind of concerning because it makes me think like maybe all the boss fights are going to be like this. I hope not but you know thinking more about all of this all of this thing's and you know, basically everything that happened so far with the game. I'm thinking that we know it can be exciting like, you know, if you unlock Super Saiyan one two, or  Free and then walk around the world, you know kicking ass, that would be really cool. But at the same time I would like to know way more about the whole video game motives and you know open the world. What's going to be open world. Which characters are we going to meet? What kind of retractions will we have with them? And as far as I'm concerned, you know, there are some really cool characters that they introduced that they were already in Dragon Ball, but never seen Dragon Ball Z such as  you know Android 8 orator that was actually really cool to see you. These are some cool Easter eggs. And on one point. They said that you know, this is just about Dragon Ball Z as the name says so no super though. I don't think they want to rule out a DLC which introduces the super version into the mix. However, if it does that that's going to suck because you know, I want to separate game for super. I mean, it's obviously not as big as Dragon Ball Z, but still  II don't want it to be DLC. I mean that's really bad if they do that. I just want to see them like, you know, give it their own game and do their best to make it a better rendition. They also said that we're not going to see anything concerning the movies is just going to be strictly anime. They didn't say manga. They just kept saying anime, so maybe filler arcs make it into the game. I'm not sure but still this journey of  Concord is really cool. I would also love to see some other characters for us to control not just go cool. I would love to control the Vegeta even in the open world and I would like to be able, you know to transform into Super Saiyan in the game games open world not just necessarily in missions. I would love to do use instance Instant Transmission in the open world. You can also use Nimbus by the way, if you don't know that there's also something really that's been bugging me and  This is probably one of the biggies if the game is going to be strictly anime. Does this mean that for example, if I'm finding Majin Buu in one of the story arcs am I gonna have to you know be strictly finding in Super Saiyan free or I can actually switch between other Super Saiyans to keep my stamina or something like a new cheat the game cheap the story actually. I don't know if that can happen. They didn't say anything about it because I think that it would be a little bit  Bad, you know if you call it action RPG open world, I'm gonna have this choice that to you know to change into a Super Saiyan whichever way I want in whatever Mission and honestly Super Saiyan 4 is going to be unlocked at you know, like the Manga and Anime at the end near the end of the supers. Sorry, Majin Buu saga, what will happen to the rest of the game. Like this would be my final form like maybe something like in supersonic where you get that form and  Temporary you use it and you're done. So what happens to the rest of the game like am I going to be able to use the rest of the forms, you know for my own free will will we have side quests that lets me use these forms and because I unlock it. I know this is a form I want well, they're obviously there will be cyclist. But will there be side quests after I finish the game and will I be able to use forms like Super Saiyan 3 which comes out like that? What happens to something like  You know vegetto super vegetto like, you know, will I be able to use that? I mean like be able to do potara Fusion. Well, I have more than one companion on missions. This is these are some of the things that we obviously have to ask and you know, we will know more as we get closer to release date but I got to say kudos to IGN for actually putting somebody there who knows a lot about Dragon Ball and asked a lot of questions that we I think that many of us wanted to ask so I guess that the gameplay looks fantastic.  Really good, the world is big but I want to see more I want to see how big this world is how many features will be have how faithful will it be to the anime to Goku's powers and how far will they take this? I'm of course very excited for Dragon Ball Z Kakarot. I mean the naming as people have pointed out. It's very much similar to Dragon Ball super Broly. But at the same time, you know, I am very excited regardless of the name. I hope you will.  Be a good game. I mean, you know many people comparing are comparing this game to Legacy of Goku. But I think this is a really good game and I'm excited. I do want to see more about this game. I do want to see more about combat about the open World and Action RPG elements that the game has I mean fishing was really cool. I think it was really something the whole making food eating it, you know, the Transformations things like that. I just want to see more about this game and honestly,  I'm super excited for and I think that they're actually doing their best. The game will be released in 2020 and not 2019 most games at E3 this year were just for 2020. No, nothing that wanted to come in 2019. However, the game will be released early 2020. We don't know the exact date so far. But again, we are of course very excited for everything and I hope they will be the best that you can be the best.  Dragon ball game that we have so far. I am excited for it because I'm thinking in the people involved are actual fans of it and they want to make the best. All right. Thank you guys for joining us. Please. Tell me what do you guys think about this game and go watch the interview gameplay demo of this game on IGN's channel. It's really worth a look. If you are Dragon Ball fan and I really feel sad for Microsoft that they didn't show this demo under stage themselves.  I'm happy that they actually did it for IGN because now I Jen could ask questions. That was necessary. Thank you guys for joining us. I hope you enjoyed this and it was informative for you guys. Of course, if this will not be the final coverage of our III, we will keep on you know, talking about things and showcase more games and talk about them. So thank you guys for joining us and I hope to see you guys very soon. 	I don't know how he can have control over it when he cut it off but still it was really really cool that you know, we saw this game we saw some of the Frieza Saga scenes and was really good but There were some things that we were asked, you know, they asked the whole developers. 
spotify:episode:454DuBfWfRmt97YHyHu7FR	Oh, man, I'm so nervous.  We need like a but I need like an intro song. Can you give me an inch or so?  Eric Nam, I'm a singer songwriter and a TV person and I do  You bunch of stuff and I travel the world and I have a good time. But welcome to the show. This is K-pop daebak. And this is the first show in case you can't tell because we're a mess but we decided we're going to try it anyways, because you can never improve something until you start it off. Wow. That sounds like a Confucian saying I am I Confucius probably no, I'm not. All right. Anyway, this is not a Kpop news show.  It is more of a closer. Look at the latest releases from your favorite K-pop stars, but having said that this is a brand new show and we're going to make things up as we go. So we absolutely need everybody's feedback and input into the show to make it the best show on the internet and something that you guys want to listen to so, let me just go ahead and throw out the socials to you is very easy it stay back show Dae Bak show. It's on Twitter is on Instagram.  And we're going to be on all the other platforms. So but for now that's pretty much all you need to know if you guys want to send us messages or tweets and tell me I'm great or that I suck or whatever. It's cool. Just let me know. I appreciate constructive criticism. Just don't make me cry. All right, so my background, why did we do this? Why are we doing this show? We just doing it, right? That's pretty cool. Just like let's just try it because you never know and so Brian, can you give us a  so we're just trying jingle we're trying hard.  We're very very high budget guys. We only use top of top of the state-of-the-art equipment and music here and I can't wait for you guys to hear everything we have in store. But anyways, pretty much I've been in this industry for what seven eight years and I think I've seen a lot and we've been through a lot as an artist and then also with my fans and so on.  Anyways, I have a very very different perspective of Kpop a little bit more of the inside scoop access to a lot of your favorite artists and potential future co-host. And so I think what this show can become is a place for fans and artists to interact and connect on a more just simply speaking Audio Level. There's a lot of video. There's a lot of complicated stuff than the world. We want to go back to just simple simple simple simpleness. And so we have this podcast anyways  We are picking releases from every week for future app episodes and we need you to let us know what songs you guys want to hear about what artist you want to hear from. This is not an official democracy because it's my show and I can do whatever I want, but I appreciate your input, right? Okay, so you go ahead and let us know vote and we'll try to incorporate your thoughts into  You guys can also go to our podcast curated playlist on Spotify and YouTube where we have all the songs from the episode and some of our favorite songs of the week in the playlist and you guys can listen to it in full and of course you want to play it on to the on to the podcast itself. But let's be honest music copyright is very difficult and expensive to navigate which is why we can't play them here on the podcast and as a musician myself, you know, it's hard to you know to get that bag.  Egg, you know, you know what I mean, you know what I mean right now. You don't know it. Listen money-making with music is very hard to get your money. It's very very hard in music. So am I just saying crazy stuff right now? I'm sorry. Did I just sound and say I'm just being real guys? Okay. All right. Anyways, let's just go ahead and go into our new releases. We're going to talk about a few new releases from this past week or two up first we got  The ladies from Mama land and the new song. I'm so hot. So mobile and is back with her new song. I'm so hot. This is a single off their fifth new Mini album called show me it was released March 20th. So maybe like two weeks ago and it is it is their faith is probably like I want to say their third hit song right because he had boom boom and they had bam and now they have shown me and before that. I feel like they were still  up-and-coming. So people don't really know a lot of their earlier songs, but I'm so hot is a very upbeat anthem for these girls as they try to show off the pretty as if the prettiest girl in class. The music video is around 20 million views and there's also a Japanese version and there are a lot of other songs on the mini album The EP falling you light up holiday and what you want and you guys go ahead and check out the songs on the EP as well. You know, I know a lot of artists, you know,  Put together mini albums and EPS. There's always like the struggle of should we just put out a single? I should put out an EP fans obviously usually want the EP because more music but the struggle and the hesitancy behind that hesitation behind that is that people don't listen to full albums anymore. They don't listen to all the songs, but we put a lot of effort into every single one of those songs. So every time there is a there is an e p you guys try to listen to as much as you can. So let's talk a little bit about the members of Mumble and  There are nine nine members. I shouldn't be surprised by now. Like like nine is a relatively small number for Kpop years. I feel like there's thirteen there's 10. There's there's a lot helping young. No, Jane Talia died on Daisy chewy and Nancy chewy, I know pretty well from we did a show together. We did this show called sometimes don't wear her money which means grandmas and sometimes home. That's a horrible translation.  But that's pretty that's pretty much what it is. We had six International Grandma's from Belgium France where else Thailand Mexico Costa Rica and they Thailand and somewhere else. Why can't I remember oh hungry and we set up a restaurant with them and we cook with them for two weeks. So that's how I got to know Chuy and she is very very very incredibly.  Be nice and talented she is such a bright personality and very It Go, I was going to try to follow the egg yolk. And then I realize you guys were probably hate it. He's like, yeah, that's horrible God. I'm so sorry, but she's super like, oh goddamn. I know my voice and then heavy and I know because she actually used to be a trainee at my company. So I've known her for four years and so it's really  You see them doing very well and to be hitting their stride finally because I know she put she put a lot of effort in four years. So seven members were formed during a reality Idol survival program called finding Momo land and then to member states and to have joined later and I'm sure you guys know they're single boom boom from their third. EP great was a huge hit and it won the 1st place at a lot of the music shows. And when will it actually became the first girl group?  And the second act to earn a platinum certification by Colin music chart for over a hundred million streams for the sound boom. Boom. I did not know that that's interesting. They also took a bunch of awards last year Asia Artist Artist Awards 2008 for best icon and music Mama 2018 discovery of the Year. Count chart Music Awards 2003 World rookie award. They got best three new artist from Japan gold disc Golden Disc from Korea digital design for boom. Boom. So they are just just take it in the awards and I  They have a very very bright future ahead of them and just were random random facts. They create a new song for Korean children's cartoon character. The song is called by don't touch huh? And I feel like it's probably sounds like button attacher. Is that it? Is that pretty much right right the song I'm if you guys haven't heard the song itself. I'm so hot for earlier Kpop loving Generations. You guys will probably remember the Wonder Girls so so hot. No no Maria by your  No, nobody. Okay. I just dated myself a lot. I'm young guys. Don't worry. But this song in particular. I realized you know, they have every song that they've been releasing after boom boom has been the very very similar formula and structure and they always have like a very hooky hooky drop and this time it wanted a went ahead and switched it up with a brass drop with some trumpet and saxophone and then they're dancing.  Worse they have I guess like a gunpoint dance where they just shoot in the sky and I had the great pleasure of learning boom boom for an award show with Chuy last year and that dance will wreck you because it's so involved and it's a great cardio workout if y'all like Zumba go ahead and try Boom Boom at Zumba. You guys will probably lose some weight. Anyways, that's the latest on I'm so hot by mole and  B I'll try to get to be on here one day I feel like she I feel like she'd do it and she she's very like scared of speaking English, but she has so much energy that I feel like you don't need to be able to speak English to be able to she can make just like really cool sounds and you guys would still be excited about it because she's such a positive energy. I'm going to shut up about that now and move on to our next song great. That's fine. Yeah page full of beans fine. We're human. I have you doing a freakin.  Uncle I have you doing a Jingle Bro our jingle is using jingle jingle a pretty sure page flip is okay. So we're going to go into our next song is called Four Seasons By town of Girls Generation and as we go into this next song we have a little a little jingle break jingle go  that was very very anticlimactic. Why is your face red, bro?  Okay. All right, fine. Okay, and James four seasons was released on March 24th, and it is about breaking up with a lover after having spent four seasons together. The music video currently has about 10 million views and Taylor stated that when she first recorded this song. She can't really relate to it in terms of the relationship and the love kind of thing, but then she thought about it and compared it to her music career and how  It's you know, very in line and in tune and she could relate to it in terms of her music career, which I think also makes sense, you know, every every relationship whether it be with a person or a job or a community, you know, you have a beginning middle and end or Etc and you know as an artist your goal and your job when you're in the studio and you're recording and putting out music is to be able to relate to the song as much as you can so that you can how do you say in Korean? It's chummed. I turned our means  Deliver that feeling in that message. Oh you guys this is great. I must teach you Korean. This is Uncle Sohail catches Raquel such under means to deliver Brian's a child. And I know you have said it wrong. It's not tongue diets chunder.  No, he said chaunged I note under there you go. Alright more. But anyways, I think that is very important as a you know, some people they write their own songs and they write their own lyrics other people. They don't and it's to each his or her own, you know, there's no there's no better or less than but at the end of the day as singers job and purpose.  She be able to really connect with listeners on a musical level and the lyrical level and so, you know, I think that's probably one of the reasons town is so good at vocal like just singing Because she really gets those lyrics across to her listeners. And so it's great that this is we know how she related to this song The Single also includes the B side. It's a song called blue and this is her first domestic release solo wise since  It's something new in June 2018 town will also be holding her first solo tour in Japan called the tan, Japan tour 2019 signal starting April 13th in Fukuoka, and I'm sure you guys already know but she is an incredibly decorated artists not only with Girls Generation, but also as a soloist got best female artist at Mama 2016. She's a golden disk Awards 2018 for her my voice studio album and I in  Teen had become the best-selling female vocal soloist album of all time on Colin. That's also interested. Look. I'm learning new things every day as I'm telling you these things but you guys may already know this before me. She also voiced Margo in the Korean vert Korean dubbed version of Despicable Me and Despicable Me 2, incredibly talented lady. I actually saw I ran into her a few weeks ago at sooyoung's Indie movie premiere so young just released a  Movie and soon was like oh, but can you please come? I really please come and I said, okay, I'll go not knowing that I would be there to see a full out Girls Generation reunions happening in front of me and I felt so out of place and I was so like because yes, like we're you know, we're still in the same industry whenever but there they were my some Biz they started much before longer before I did and I remember when I  They are just did a come back with a song I think was I Got a Boy and I was a ho it's Girls Generation. Oh my gosh, and then TB their kind of as a friend and to witness their of reunions of sorts. It was like a very very weird and surreal moment, but they're all doing well and Tiffany had flown in the night before I think presumably for the movie premiere and to do some some promotions for her.  New solo stuff in the States, but she obviously is killing it in the states as well with her English EP and so great to see all the ladies doing well in their own respective careers and their paths and congratulations to town on her latest released Four Seasons. All right, next up we have another track but we need another transitional jingle jingle jingle jingle.  You're asking too much. This is the most underwhelming. Jingler I've ever met your two seconds away from being fired. I'm just giving you fair warning. Hey guys. So have you ever really considered making your own podcast? Well, you guys can do it all on anchor because anchor gives you all the tools. You need to make your podcast right from your phone or computer and then when it's done, it's uploaded on Spotify Apple podcast and all the other  A platform so that you can make money and people can listen to it really quickly. So you guys definitely check it out download the free anchor app or go to Anchor dot. F m-- to get started and join me in the world of podcasting and Kpop daebak. All right. So next up we have Persona RM solo from BTS. So, okay listen.  I'm a big BTS fan. Everybody knows that and I'm really just I'm just good friends with them. You know, I've I've it's been an honor and it's been a pleasure to watch them really come up from their debut, but I'm just really jealous because listen this Persona trailer come back trailer for the new upcoming album map of the Soul Persona. So that went live March 27th 2019, correct? Correct the other  The thing is that this is a comeback trailer but this comeback trailer is higher quality than most anybody's full-out come back. So I'm watching this video and he has like a II robot machines dancing. He has a big like ginormous Mewtwo Pokemon version looking like creature who I think it looked kind of look like they had taken our MS face and  Like added to it. So it looked like an animation. I don't know if you've I don't know if I don't know maybe it's just me, but but they have like incredible production on it for this comeback trailer. So a that's amazing be I'm jealous. See you guys are amazing Persona. This is a solo rap written and performed by RM the leader of BTS. And of course it.  Has already surpassed 20 million views in less than a week. I expect no less their album is going to be released April 12th Friday. So we're very very very close you guys. We're about a week away and I'm sure everybody knows about BTS, but just in case you don't know BTS is composed of seven members RM Jin Suga. J-hope, jimin V and Jung gook and the animated beginning is actually a call back to their old school old album Skool Luv.  Fair come back trailer from 5 years ago. I can't believe it's been five years.  That's time flies and a lot of the fans speculate. The BTS New Era concept is based on Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung's archetypes of the self which are Persona Shadow anima and ego. And so I don't know. I think a lot of people are speculating that the Future album series to come maybe it'll follow in those Footsteps in the trailer RM addresses and shows the four parts of his Persona what perhaps is his true self. He is an idol. He's a rapper he is a leader.  He's just keeping them June as well RM and that's pretty much what the song is about. And you know, I think the guys have BTS, you know, a few of them have been including RM have been very openly not outspoken. That's not the road. They've just been very open about, you know, their thoughts and their feelings and identity and their hardships and everything in their interviews their message their fans in their music and that's probably the reason that they're so relatable to  To a global audience very open about stuff like that and I think he addresses you know that identity crisis in many ways in this song. So yeah, this is obviously the kickoff to their new album. I think everybody is incredibly incredibly excited incredibly excited to the point that within a week of the announcement BTS. So 2.6 million copies in pre-sales that's unheard of these days.  Right for map of the Soul Persona are also going to be on a world tour and they actually sold out Wembley Stadium in 90 minutes that venue capacity is ninety thousand seats. Now. I don't know like if ninety thousand seats are fully like booked out in terms of stadium capacity because when you set up a concert, you have to kill a part of the seats because you have to make room for the stage, but regardless, that's huge. That's right.  Really huge and they will be performing at Saturday Night Live as their comeback stage, which is also insane that's going to be April 13th Saturday the day after Persona drops and typically on SNL the musical guest they will perform two songs. And so you can fully expect to songs and probably with a live band and I can't tell you why I know that but I imagine it's going to be with the full band. Yeah. It's going to be it's going to be pretty little  I think and if you guys don't know what Saturday Night Live is SNL in the states, it is a truly truly iconic. It's a truly iconic TV show for they're probably in there 40-something see the season and they've had the biggest range of successful movie stars actors actresses TV stars. Come on that show as guests, but also they start their to become  Um who they are. So these people I don't know if you guys don't like Jim Carrey Eddie Murphy Adam Sandler Tina Fey like Will Ferrell like all these people they're huge but they all got started on SNL and then the other thing about us and I was when you start doing a music slot on SNL that really brings you into the Forefront of Western media. So I still remember when Sam Smith and Adele both before they were huge. They had a lot of  Surround them and then they went on a snow and the day after they hit number one on like iTunes. They were just topping the charts right after that. So, you know BTS the biggest group in the world. I don't know how much bigger they can possibly get. But if there's a great move and a great way to build it up. This is the move so congratulations to the guys. I can't wait to hear this new album and watch this come backstage at SNL the first time I think it was the first time I met them they were super  Super energetic and super nice and I watch them perform on the show and I was actually very very surprised, you know, as a host of a show like that were every week at that point. I think we did two shows a week. You meet different new Idol stars. And you meet the biggest crook like the newest rookies like some of them they don't make it. Unfortunately. Let's be very honest like this is a very very Cutthroat industry and there are a lot of factors that play into  A lot of the people that I work with or that interviewed a lot of them aren't working in the industry anymore. But every once in a while you come across groups and you're like, oh wow, like this team has potential this team could be very very special and BTS was one of those groups they came on very very well-mannered. They work really hard and as you know, I don't know I guess for me. I know because I'm on TV constantly, but really what makes it TV show fun is not only the  the host but how much the guest put into it how much effort they put into it and I just remember us Finishing Touch. I'm like you guys those are really nice kids, but they also worked really hard and after that when they every time they came back they would be at another level. They would have gone up. You know, they were like Pokemon they just keep evolving every time they come but they are now literally at the top of the world and I'm so happy for them because if anything else if I like they  State so in my opinion humble and they still work harder than anyone else and they're very very aware and self-awareness. I think is very important. They know what the impact they have on the world. And so they think their music and their craft and their jobs, you know in many ways very very seriously. And so I respect them so much for that and they I see them every once in a while and some of them are  Keep in touch with that girly, but I'm so happy for them to see them growing and blowing up in this way. And that's probably why they're down like representing Korea for everything. You know, there are featured on the official Korean national anthem video, which is like I didn't even know like do countries to make national anthem videos. I didn't even know that but yeah, I'm excited like I  Overstating that but it's going to be dope RM also in case you guys are sleeping under a rock collaborated with this Duo artist called on on a remix. I guess of a new track that they did it's called crying over you and it's on Hans last album and originally just has his female vocalist called Becca with them. But now it's Han with Becca and RM. Yeah. It's a great saw Han is Hun is great to guys if you guys don't know Han is super great eye.  I met huh. I think three years ago at those like my birthday was like my birthday party and we had we went to Hans concert and then we went to have some food and like a beer and Han came Sooyoung from Girls Generation was there and V came and that's probably when V and Han first met and then I don't know probably RM and then they got connected through.  Twitter's because that's how I think a lot of them have been keeping in touch. But if you guys haven't done so check out crying over you as well in addition to the Persona trailer, which is a bigger better mood music video than I'll ever be able to achieve in my entire lifetime.  All right, that's enough of that.

You betcha guy here with Ryan the T-shirt guy. We're you betcha radio the coldest podcast in all of the Midwest. We're thinking we're gonna have a little bit shorter podcast for you. It's hot because it's hot too because Ryan just got done with the flu. I was oh I was bedridden.  For like 32 hours, he's bedridden we should have done the podcast. Like I should have like from look from the back. I should have videoed in we could have had a puke break for you. But this is gonna be a short podcast. Let's get into the show. I would venture to say it's almost the nectar of the Gods back baby back. I want my food my God, that's cold.  Yeah, what's up guys? Welcome back to episode 27 the we've gotten into the habit of like naming podcast. The last one is the bolt podcast. This one is just like the hot this is the muggy podcast short and sweaty is what I'm calling it The like Little Caesars Hot and Hot and Hot and Ready but it's short and sweaty and I don't become hot and sweaty. He's yeah, but this will be the short and sweaty podcast episode 27. Well, it's funny is it sounds like when they're naming the  Episodes it's like the one where so and so does this it's is that's how we're going to start naming these podcasts? Yeah the short and sweaty what's cool is we've it's been a couple podcast. I feel like since I've been able to plug some t-shirts on the website. Yep. So guys, we have all of the merchandise open. That's that's the current cases. Well not the current gas station design is based off of our favorite breakfast pizza. Yep.  As well as all the past designs classical Ryan is like we're trying to avoid dropping any name so we can avoid any sort of legal action and he just drops the name right away your will be were talking about your cousin right my cousin case your cousin makes great pizza. Yeah. So we have the new design out. We have all of the previous designs. Those are open on the website at www.allaboutdoors.com. And we also put them out another Banger of a  Today dad's during the summer. So make sure you go check that one out. We might get a little bit into that today that's on all of our social channels at. Oh you betcha go check them out. We the page has been spreading like wildfire. We just did a podcast three weeks to a month ago celebrating a hundred thousand likes. Yeah followers hundred thousand followers. So we're probably out of getting close to a hundred forty-five thousand followers now, which is crazy so that  Is crazy so when you initially put that put the dad video today you I'm not going to get too deep into it because I don't wanna spoil it for anyone. But what were your thoughts on just pushing that out the door and how did you come up with a lot of those little bits? Well before we get into that Ryan I want to talk to you guys about you Motors Motorsports Marine located in Fargo North Dakota and Pelican Lake Minnesota. They have all the Best Brands Honda Yamaha. See do Can-Am the tea.  Vote Super Bowl Supreme bolts all the boats all of the boats and also Avalon pontoons great for boating around and drinking Bush lattes. I was trying to keep this podcast short the short and sweaty, but I forgot about some screwed-up the most important part the guys that you Motors you can find you Motors on all their social medias or at you Motors inc.com. That's you Motors inc.com spelled you mot ORS  Dot-com you mention this ad to get 20% off parts and accessories some exclusions May apply. They're great guys over at you Motors guys and gals. So if you're looking for a new boat new jet ski, give them a holler. There's still time left in the summer to use you to utilize that boat. So give those guys a call. Yeah. I'm still trying to run still in puke mode is what he's where he's at right now. I forgot all of them also to stand up jet ski mode right now. That's true.  So right now he's wearing our fourth of July Jersey tank and he's still in Fourth of July mode. Yep. It's a nice for you to show up today. I didn't know if you're going to come. I thought you were still on the beach tanning but made it. So the dad video it was really fun to do because my sister actually called me today and she said she literally goes so that video was called dad's during summer. You could have just called it my dad during summer because  was basically it wasn't that hard to come up with stuff for the video because I just took what my dad did Growing Up and just put it into a video. I don't know if you felt that or if you felt honored that was it was I wasn't that wasn't so I have really young parents. I was up early on grandparents and that was more relatable to my grandpa who's sense spent a ton of time with us when we were younger you watch this during the day I'm parents were at work. So I saw a lot of that in my grandpa with  Shoes and and playing basketball and down base. I bought queso what I did when I bought those New Balance shoes. So if you haven't seen this video, you gotta go watch it. But basically about the classic white New Balance dad shoes and these things came in just blazing white what I'm talking like the whitest of all white and you've all seen that Dad that gets a fresh pair and he's flaunting it around where he's gone. But I wanted this to look like I was do some right yardwork new.  Balances so before so when I ordered them, I ordered either's option for regular wide and extra-wide. I believe that's got to be like the only shoe on planet Earth that comes in extra wide. So obviously I ordered extra wide because I wanted The Full Experience. Yep, but these things came out blazing white. So literally I had to make them look like I use them a lot. So I took them and I just went found a dirt patch and I just started rubbing them in the dirt patch.  Not knowing if it was going to work or not and I pulled it up and I was like these literally look like a dad is worn these for like three years. So that worked out pretty nice. I had to get the grass stains on their you name it. I think New Balance should really capitalize on putting like a grass graphic on the side of the shoe you get you got like Blades of grass coming up from the soul. That would be like ultimate yard work. Yeah, just like even just like a there's like a Faith from the  From the sole of the shoe just Fades green up into the shoe at all times. Yeah, though. Honestly think that they should do that. So New Balance hit us up. I'll be the poster child for your campaign to get these sold. But yeah, I'm looking forward to doing more content with the new balances. I kind of fell in love with them. I get why dad's love those shoes. They're very comfy. They're extra wide. They're pretty great. So I have nothing to complain about in the dad world.  So far. Yeah, and I as much as I would love to get into my favorite Parts, I think you should just go watch it at oh you betcha. You don't spend a good video so far and super relatable to every dad or Grandpa out there has done it. There's it's bit after bit after bit. Everyone is done at least 4 to 6. Yeah, at least yeah and I always love seeing the comments of stuff that I left out that I actually think is really funny as well.  I'm excited to read those comments and do that.  What are some things growing up that your dad did that you didn't realize was ridiculous until you got like out of it and started meeting other families and all that man. So one thing that my dad did I'll kick it off. Yeah, and maybe other people did this but I thought it was, you know, just a normal thing and then I like God I was like, huh? That's really crazy and weird that he did that my dad kept a five gallon bucket in his closet.  And he's like most people have a change jar. He would throw all of his change in this five gallon bucket and he would fill up the entire 5 gallon bucket of change and then bring it to the bank and like walk out of the bank with like a thousand bucks. Yeah, like father like son. He's a gas station guy comes back with change every day. If you like gas stations as much as we do you should have a large change jar that you can treat yourself at the end of the year by going to cash that baby.  In yep, it's going right because there's literally like a friend laughter fruit fly in here. So that's gorgeous self some good breakfast pizza with the extra cash and have a good weekend. Yep. I don't know what I mean is that ridiculous to have a full five gallon bucket? Well because normally people have like the the oversized plastic bottles, right the it's not actually a lot of butter. Well, no, that's like the oversized like big plastic talking about like they're actually for coin. Yes. Yeah.  You're talking about whenever I go to a friend's house when I was younger. I was always so jealous that they had a big thing of change. You don't have that much change. Your parents are filling that thing for you. Right? Well that's goes back to another issue is the kids who got allowances growing up. Oh man. Did you get on loans? Well, here's the thing. I'm trying to think of like odd stuff. My dad has done but I can't really I can't really put my thumb on it. But one thing that my dad made us do was he he owned a landscaping business for ten years.  Ears and he had three probably three to four hundred plants in our backyard. He didn't have like a storage shed or like an extra piece of property. He kept his stuff on you guys just had a full thing at the full like landscaping business and just your backyard. Yeah, and we and we had a we had a pretty pretty big backyard so it worked out well, but it was our responsibility my brothers and I to to water those plants every single day free labor, right? No, we actually got paid hourly. So that's nice. We were screwed.  Down, you know we draw. Oh, why do I feel bad for you at all anymore? You got paid but I had to work for it. I didn't just get an allowance. Like here's 20 bucks for the week. Yeah. So what we had to do was the worst but once a month we have to spend an entire Summer Afternoon picking weeds out of out of the Landscaping at our place did the same thing. So I hopefully other people can relate to this my classic patented move.  As I try to get the roots out, right? That's the goal with the weed you try and get deep down in there and you pull that road off but one in every like six. Yeah, and I'm just popping the top off on accident and there's the route there and I was at Arias for just doing one of these looking left and right fruit fly in my face looking left and right and then just taking the Rocks over there and just push it over the weed and look like I pulled the weed. Yeah. Yeah, and now it's weird.  Because we had to do this yard work when we were younger and my dad he he wanted to do the business for ten years. He shut her down. It's tough on the body. He had done it for 20 years before that and I'm like, yeah, you know, how come you didn't ever ever consider like handing over the business or keeping it for my brother? And I he goes when you guys were watering plants when you're younger, I knew right then and there you were going to take this business owner. Is that a hit to Your Ego a little bit Ryan kind of but I also don't  I want to water plants like that. Yeah weird because now that I have my own yard, I take a lot of pride in making sure that that looks nice and you know, I'm doing different designs that are new to the new truck. I got. Yep. I'm in that car wash like every week. Yeah. Well, yes, you did it right and you got the monthly car wash subscription. Yeah. So sometimes we go twice a week. Yeah the unlimited it definitely pays for itself you roll up looking like a boss and you're clean truck, but I can only get the  I totally get the like taking ownership in your yard. Yep. Yeah, but your fiance is also kind of crazy about the yard to essentially what the plants. Yeah, right. So I'm more about the grass. She's more about the plants. Yeah, so I want to talk about that a little bit more. We're going to take our first break and I want to talk a little bit about the Landscaping at your house Ryan. Okay, Ryan before the break we were talking about how you take pride in the lawn and more of just the overall Landscaping.  And the aesthetic of it. Yep, and your fiance takes a lot of pride in the flowers. Yeah plants. Yeah. My question is when do women it doesn't have to be women's 2019. I can't say that. When do women start all of a sudden knowing a lot about flowers and plants and also like caring about it because it's like my mom knows how much the water certain plants. What if she can look at a plant know what kind of plant it is.  I'm like sitting there like I have absolutely no idea. But at what points do they gain that knowledge because I know women that are like my age or younger that like they couldn't tell you anything like that. I've all of a sudden we made just acquire this knowledge. Where does it come from? I feel like it's always present in them. It's a generational thing. Right? So like you never that's an interesting question. I always feel like it's passed down from generation to generation. Like my you're my teacher said mom is he super  into plants landscape flowers all that kind of stuff. So she she saw her doing it when she was younger and you know, she probably wasn't into it much when she was living in a college dorm or like a townhome third fourth year in college, but now that she has her own place. She's like, oh so now like now I can start by this knowledge. Yes. I like to imagine that it's one of those things. That's just dormant in female Dan DNA, right? So like when we all get to puberty SAR body starts to change when women get  Married and have a house their intellect changes to knowing a lot about flowers and plants. I just imagine that here's a funny story. So we were adding a couple plants in the landscape and one of them died right away. So Meg calls her mom and she goes hey, why did this plant died? Like I had watered it just like oh, well you that that's that's a let's say hypothetically. Oh, that's a hosta you're not supposed to plant that on the sun side of the house. She's has cell right there.  Mom knew that like it's it's a it's a trial error thing. It's a generational thing. So now Meg no was to not plant again hostas, whatever on the sun sun sun side of the house. So she honestly I have no idea. What a hosta is. Yeah. I've heard it a ton. I don't care. If you said point out the hostas in the landscape I couldn't tell you that is just like so like standard for dudes, right? Is this like we here?  Certain phrases and all that like you here here. Yeah, you here? Mascara. You're not entirely sure where to put mascara. You know, what goes on a woman's face. So like it's masturbation. I imagine is probably the first makeup you put on your face that side but I couldn't tell you for sure does mascara go on with a brush. Does it go on with like it like I squirted on the assorted on we know what it is, but we don't we don't know that if you're facing.  Nothing to get mascara on I have no idea. These are the type of things that are not in our DNA. I feel like if you ask me to hey, do you have crab grass in your yard? Like? Oh, yes. It is bad. It seems naturally know what it is. Yeah. This is this is the crabgrass I got going but what's really nice is the previous homeowners of ours had a full sprinkler system and we're in the middle of town. So we have a that's a big-time A positive to buying a house it is it is full sprinkler.  You can look at the line that I draw with my Mower on our edge of the property to my neighbors. It's like crisp like like golden brown green on my neighbors as just plush green. So my side now confirmed that Ryan is a full fledge lawn snob just by talking crap about his neighbor's he out williard on the podcast if I my yard would look like that if I never sprinkler system, but  I wouldn't get one of those one of those sprinkler heads that hooks up to the hose. That's a tractor. I love that on its own. Yep. I always was so fascinated with those as a kid. I was like, how does that work? I do not understand how that work is it moves at a ridiculously slow pace, but the water is coming out of just high speeds. Those are the best. That's another thing. I would like for people to explain to me just like the firecracker thing.  How on Earth does a tractor sprinkler head work? I don't get it. I would love to open one of those babies up and just see the mechanics inside of it. I don't know if there is anything inside of it. I think it has very big like tread on the tires like plastic tread that it the the but how do the tires move if that's all any sense. I do not get it because there's no there's no electric plug-in Ryan. Is this always  Water powered so it's got all be mechanisms inside of the tractor. I would like to open up one of those and see what's going on on the inside. It's right people listen to this podcast. I think are these guys I know this, how are these guys have any sort of following on the internet they are idiots, but honestly, I have no idea how that works. So question of the day that is the question of the day how on Earth does a tractor sprinkler head move and work because it doesn't make any sense.  This is the hot are the sweaty short and sweaty and fruit fly podcast. We must have left like some food out or something that these babies are in here. Probably that's just the way it goes Ryan. But yeah, I always found that fascinating but was funny as my mother was my mother understands style and design really well and she's the classic like if my dad wanted to wear New Balance shoes should be like, you're not wearing that because you look,  Like too much I get Dad. Yeah, which is I don't think it's a bad thing. Basically. She likes my dad to look like a hip dad versus just the guy the classic dad move. Yeah, so I don't think I'll ever see my dad in a pair of New Balances and it probably scars my mother to watch that video. But but we that being said the same type of thing. My family just wasn't tractor sprinkler head people sure and  So when I saw friends that had it I was so jealous. They were yeah, we definitely had one and I think it's just depends on family and family and we had all the other sprinkler heads. We just never had a tractor one. I was just always like goddess. Oh sweet the classic that you stick it on the hose, right? Yep, the classic the classic dull yellow the other white Wheels. Yep, that's exactly what I was thinking. Whoever came up with that has done a great job. It'd be cool if they dropped in a comment and brought us exactly through how these things.  Work what if the founder of the tractor sprinkler was a fan of the page? Is there like a specific brand that we need to be talking about? I don't know that would be that would be so funny. If you even for one podcast, we got them to sponsor the podcast for the tractor sprinkler heads. That would be so funny. I would love that but it probably not gonna happen. I'm gonna happen but whatever. Um,  Sadly, I'm not a homeowner yet Ryan, so I cannot participate in lawn talk very well. Obviously growing up at mow the lawn and participate in landscaping and all that for a house, but current situation. I am not a homeowner, so I can't I can't weigh in too much. But yeah, there are there are weeds growing at the edge of the the edge of the shop driveway is that we've got those must have just appeared though because it hasn't been there for very long.  Yeah, I got some Roundup at home if you'd like to borrow something. Okay, so that's another thing when you talk about Ryan people are dying from Roundup. Okay. What are you okay? I don't even think we want to get into this. They're not dying from rusted-out break of people who have used Roundup and have side effects. They say there can be together right? I say there's no cancer. Yep the amount of Roundup that you would have to physically open up and drink for you to get deathly ill.  Well, it's astronomical so I'm with you. I'm just saying I am just reporting. I know what the news says Ryan so, okay what I love about this is Ryan is the classic. So I grew up not necessarily in a rural rural area where I'm like directly associated with farming. I am a concrete product. You're not a farming product both very tough manual labor, but  Totally different Realms, right? And every time I bring up a topic about something that he's either fertilizer or crop or anything like that Ryan just gets this look in his eye like he wants to fight me. It's unbelievable. I've never seen that look. I think I could literally insult your fiance your mother, you know, and you would be like, haha nice one miles and then I bring up something about how fertilizers not good for the environment and you would want to rip my head off.  You want to remove never seen anyone like that before? I'm I'm marrying into a very large farm fan. I get that. I'm all for I'm on board with the classic that I like to think about his people they take planes and over cities they spray for mosquitoes and everyone's okay with them spraying this chemical over the entire city that we're at but they're not okay with spraying fertilizer that's been cleared as okay to consume and all that. I'm on board with that. Yeah, but I like to  Bring it up because you guys so worked up about you can hating in people on the internet are just theirs.   Oh my God, that's called people on the internet. You're saying. Yeah, that's all I have to say is people on the internet man. Awesome HSM a which the funniest conspiracy theory is that I like to hear about is when planes fly over they leave they leave a like a they leave a trail. So essentially like a like a smoke Trail, whatever Jet Trail get rich, that's true. You will jet stream.  Whatever. There are people out there that believe that is called a chem Trail in which there are chemicals in the let's just say in the feel of the plane. It puts out. This gas that that's like it's kind of like natural selection so that those fumes will come down eventually on to Mainland and they will weed people out they'll get sick they'll die. And then just repeat the process over. Yeah. I've been called cam Tran  of the strong ones. So I'm totally on board with that. I believe I can withstand jet fuel run off and survive. I believe I can I don't think I was going to survive this crew members possible out there that think that cow farts are polluting the air and routing the ozone layer you realize that lion. Yeah. It's kind of the same concept. Yeah, it's unbelievable on the topic of like getting and getting sick and stuff. Did you hear about  You getting the flu this weekend? Yeah, so originally what I thought had happened was I think last weekend or over the fourth? Maybe the fourth was last weekend only Spanish. No, it's at all two weekends ago. Okay. So two weeks ago over that weekend. There was a big party on I think like Lake Minnetonka out in Minnesota and there were a bunch of boats pulled up to a certain spot. Like everyone is out. I'll partner and a bunch of like a over like a hundred people got sick because  I were like pissing in the water and I don't know some shit in the water what the deal was but someone left a floater in the water. So the classical floater there's all this bacteria and a bunch of people got sick from it. Now God just thinking okay, just pause. Okay, just think about that sandbar that everyone's at and pissing and shitting in. Oh man, like literally just walking around in a giant porta potty. Yes. I look disgusting is that if you're in like me,  Or like thigh high water and you see someone drop to your knees. Get out get away from there get out. But that was the situation. I was in on Saturday. We were at like this big you were walking around the porta potty. Well. No, it's actually like a lake and like a porta potties a big Sand Bar with a bunch of boats. Yeah. We were in that situation and I literally thought I was I had like some bacteria sickness from people piss in the water and I'm sick of it. I am victim of it. I  Well guys like was mined in the water. Well that goes back to Natural Selection. You clearly got taken down by that where I would just thrive in that environment. Yeah here Li off of Darwinism and natural selection. So it's like strong strong genes strong DNA strong Health like the white truth says we need desalinate ization stations where you just like rub your hands and like dirt and poop and mud and yep. So your love you. Yeah your immune system gets used to being exposed to that. And so so I  Thought I was getting broken down by the natural selection bacteria example, you need to vacuum about just maybe once a month instead of like three times a month. Ryan fact. Yep. Just get start there, right you get more dust in your system. You sure just start building up that immune system since clearly your immune system is so entirely week. Yeah. Maybe I just don't want you to die on me girl my fingernails out for like a month straight Roma shit that gets under there. Yeah, and then just at the end of the month you just  Chew them all off and get all that bacteria inside your mouth man. I'm be a strong boy. Yeah, see it. Someday, you'll get to our level run a superior human. I'll strong genes in humans that do not get sick now watching like three days. I'm going to be like Ryan. I'm dying. I can't speak. I'm sick. We gotta go to the Ozarks and week and a half. So yeah, they're not let's talk about that a little bit as we keep going on.  Short podcast which is funny because it's probably not going to end up in the show. Ryan is sweating. I think you still are sick. Are you breaking your feet still sick? I think you're breaking your fever. We're going to the Ozarks. Ladies and gentlemen, July 27th. We're going to be at Shady Gators on Lake Ozark. I heard it's a crazy party bar.

spotify:episode:79txjRa3xuTvzkjLhRvBgR	Welcome to reality hacker TV. I am your host Michael Gustin very glad to be here with you today. Very glad to be here with you today, you know sitting here and talking with you we're talking as I imagine. You're listening. It is really exciting for me exciting in the sense that  I know a lot of reception is from your end and a lot of giving is on my end. And to me this whole podcast is and a a continuous event of of giving or I'm able to give in the best way that I know how which is sharing my experiences and my life and my ideas with you in the hopes that you'll take them and if they serve you well use them.  to your full advantage and if they don't  that's okay too. So today is going to be a little bit of a different episode. If you're in our Facebook group Law of Attraction reality. Agrico, you can find us on Facebook or go to reality hacker community.com. I recently asked our group if they wanted to receive biblical commentary under the context of Knuckles work and you know, because if you read  A lot of Neville Goddard you see that he references the Bible a lot, but he doesn't reference the Bible in an Evangelical way. He references it in a mystical way in an allegorical way and today I want to follow in those footsteps. If you know me, you know, I used to be a pastor. I was heavily involved in Christianity until I realized the things that Neville speaks about and and that ultimately is what led to why I'm here today speaking to you about  About this and it's my first time publicly talking about, you know, the Bible and things inside of the Bible and really relating to them and teaching with them in a while. So I appreciate that. You're here listening. No, there's no Dogma being spread here. It's plain and simple what I like to call identity Discovery. The Bible is the greatest psychological handbook that has ever been written. You can debate the historicity of it all day.  The esoteric truths that litter its pages are innumerable and there's really so many you could create books and books and books and books and books on the esoteric and Mystic literature that is inside of the Bible So today, we're going to take Psalm 23 one of the most famous songs. We're going to take Psalm 23 and we're going to do a little commentary on it and at the end of this I hope that you come away.  Say with some confidence in who you really are in your ability to create your experiences and your circumstances because I know I am so without further Ado. Let's get started.  Psalm 23  The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures. He leads me besides the Still Waters. He restores my soul. He leads me in Paths of righteousness for his namesake. Yea, though, I walk through the valley of the shadow of death. I will fear no evil for thou art with me your rod and your staff. They comfort me you prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies you anoint my head with oil.  Oil and my cup runs over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.  Really really Sleek passage, you know this this this this song is referenced in in so many movies and different places. You know, it's really one of the most famous songs. But the first part we go into this we look at the Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want here's what we really be get to dive into this from a Neville perspective when we understand that imagination is God imagination is the creative power of the universe my awareness of being  Right as never would say your awareness of being is the creative power in your life and what you are aware of dominantly create some produces the substance of itself in your life. So my awareness is the Lord and Shepard that which I am aware of being is the sheep that follow me.  So good as Shepherd is my awareness of being it has never lost one sheep or thing that I am aware of being my Consciousness is a voice calling in the wilderness of human confusion calling all that. I am conscious of being to follow me.  So well do my sheep know my voice that they have never failed to respond to my call nor will there ever come a time when that which I am convinced that I am will fail to find me. I am an open door for all that. I am to enter my awareness of being is the Lord and Shepherd of my life. Now. I know I shall never be in need of proof or lack of evidence of that which I am aware of.  Being knowing this I shall become aware of being great loving wealthy healthy and all other attributes that I admire and if you want to follow along this is in Neville's book your faith is your fortune. This is a commentary on the 23rd psalm featuring some of Neville's ideas and also some of mine so my awareness is my Lord and Shepherd that which I am aware of being is the sheep that follow me, right so that which  Which I am aware of being is.  The sheep that follow me the awareness is the Lord the unconditioned awareness is the Lord.  The conditioned awareness that which I am aware of being is the sheep that follow me. So good a Shepherd is my awareness of being that it has never lost one sheep or thing that I am aware of being and what this means is that so good. So powerful. So consistent is our emotional focus our emotional awareness are intensely emotional dominant States Of Consciousness the perceptions which  Harmony or inner dialogue during the day with emotional charges  never fails to find us in this world because as within so without and you can have total confidence in this my Consciousness is a voice calling in the wilderness of human confusion calling all that. I am conscious of being to follow me.  So well do my sheep know my voice that they have never failed to respond to my call nor will the ever come a time when that which I am convinced that I am will fail to find me.  I am is the Lord the unconditioned awareness of being that creates reality physical experience.  I am is the Lord conditioned. I am-ness I am healthy. I am healthy I am wise are the Sheep.  That follow I am and everywhere I go there. I am. So none of my sheep will ever fail to find me.  Because my sheep never fail to find.  I am  which is the creative power that creates through us through others in this physical world.  I am an open door for all that I am to enter my awareness of being is the Lord and Shepherd of my life. Now. I know I shall never be in need of proof or lack the evidence of that which I am aware of being knowing this. I shall become aware of being great loving wealthy healthy and all other attributes that I admire. I am an open door for all that. I am to enter wow, so I am the awareness.  Is of being the creative power of the universe and open door for all that? I am to enter all that implies multiple things implies sheep implies characteristics implies attributes healthy wealthy wise  I am is an Open Door for all that I am could be to enter my awareness of being.  Is the Lord and Shepherd Of My Life?  Now that I know this I will never be in need or proof of proof or lack of evidence of that which I'm aware of being because I know that if I'm aware of being something my sheep will not fail to find me my job here is to to persist in what I am aware and what I am wanting.  Persist in that awareness of being persist in the present awareness of being that which I want to be and my sheep will never fail to find me just like when I am sitting in the awareness of what I do not want to be my sheep also find me the Sheep of poverty the Sheep of sickness the Sheep of lack the sheep that is lack the sheep that is poverty the sheep. That is sickness.   The Sheep never failed to find I am that which you are aware of being must unfold itself into your life. This is the law.  He makes me to lie down in Green Pastures my awareness of being magnifies all that. I am aware of being so there is ever an abundance of that which I am conscious of being it makes no difference what it is that man is conscious of being he will find it eternally springing in his world. The Lord's measure or man's conception of himself is always pressed down shaken together and running over.  My awareness of being magnifies all that. I am aware of being it's really simple my awareness of being magnifies itself. So it's saying exactly what it's saying. We cannot be aware of the fact that we're so struggling to find work and we're struggling to create a business and we're struggling to get this off the ground and we're struggling in this relationship. We can't carry the consciousness of this and expect the Consciousness to not produce itself.  world because that which we are aware of being magnifies what we are aware of being  and the Lord's measure or my conception of myself my ideas about myself and what I believe I deserve of what I am aware that I should have and I do have  is given back to me pressed down shaken together running over.  I can never get in my life anything. Other than that, which I am aware of being like sheep. Never fail to follow me. They never fail to find me.  Everything that I am aware of being I am producing more of in my world and it doesn't matter how much action I'm taking in the opposite direction.  I can even think that I'm taking action to produce my goal my desired outcome, but if I am not already aware of being  That desired outcome of having accomplished that desired outcome. It will never come out.  It's really interesting when you take the word outcome and reverse it. It's come out because your desires come out of imagination desire exists to be gratified in the activities of imagination and then produced in the world of senses.   desire comes out  it comes out via our awareness of being he leads me beside the Still Waters.  There is no need to fight for that which I am conscious of being for all that. I am conscious of being shall be led to me as effortlessly as a Shepherd leads his flock to The Still Waters of a quiet spring.  You know when I had my my God, oh God experience in 2015. You know, I was I was told her say that that very same thing you can have and be and do whatever you want and it doesn't have to be hard. It doesn't have to be crazy stressful. It doesn't have to be anxiety-provoking because you possess the power of God the infinite power the creative power of the universe.  It doesn't have to be hard but it only gets hard when we've got those deeper underlying fundamental concepts.  that determine that it's going to be hard for us because the truth is all of these perceptions about things being hard and frustrating their only most of the time I would say  that they are from other people. We've never given ourselves a chance. Most of us don't give ourselves a chance to reassign meaning to different concepts that we've been told about struggle and strife and luck and all these different kinds of things in success and wealth in the truth is you deserve success. You deserve wealth. You deserve Health you deserve life. You deserve goodness. You deserve it because of who you are not because of what you do because the truth is it does not matter how much you do.  Doing in order to determine adequacy.  Is an infinitely constricting Paradox if I try and Define how much needs to be done before I can enjoy an emotional experience.  That measure of how much needs to be physically done. It is literally going to be endless because that way of looking at things as backwards because the world is an out picturing of Consciousness Consciousness is not an out picturing of the world that which we are aware of being we become in this physical world. And this is the only way the only way that our lives unfold the biggest hindrance that most of us have is that we are to unconscious  We're to unaware about the stories that we carry.  So take a note take a note. I challenge you I invite you to take a note of your common daily mental dialogue.  Take a note about how you perceive yourself in relation to circumstances when something goes wrong. How do you react because how you react determines and exposes exactly what you believe about yourself?  You know when a relationship goes south we're going to respond most of the time with one of two things. I knew that was going to happen or oh it's going to be okay and those two responses indicate and come from two completely different places in Consciousness. One is a cycle that perpetuates broken relationships in the other.  The other is one that understands that things are always working out regardless of their seeming appearance and those two mindsets those two fundamental beliefs will take both of those people down completely different paths in their lives.  He restores my soul. He leads me in the paths of righteousness for his namesake.  Now that my memory is restored so that I know that I am is the Lord and besides me I am there is no God. My kingdom is restored my kingdom which became dismembered in the day that I believed in Powers apart from myself is now fully restored. And now that I know my awareness of being is God I shall make the right use of this knowledge by becoming aware of being that which I desire to be wow. There's a lot  Inside of this now that my memories restored now that I have come to remember that I am is the Lord and what I am aware of being is constantly manifesting itself in my world.  My kingdom is restored.  My kingdom which became dismembered when I believed in Powers apart from myself is now fully restored so we can understand here that we actually and see in this is super important when we allow other people's ideas and dichotomies and paradigms and paradoxes to dictate the way that we believe.  We lose our kingdom we dismember our kingdom. It doesn't matter how well-intentioned it is. You can you don't have to be a great like we think that being nice means taking on other people's beliefs. It doesn't being nice is accepting that people's beliefs are what they are, but you have no obligation to believe exactly what they believe see the Temptation and the desire the willingness to believe what somebody else believes without searching it out for  Sounds comes from the psychological, you know, these these underlying mammalian mindsets of social acceptance. And the truth is nobody that ever really did anything truly great is is concerned with being accepted. They're concerned with doing great things. Now when you fabricate these stories when you craft these dramas that imply your desires are for for Luma for fulfilled.  You can absolutely leverage people accepting and congratulating you that's all fine and dandy, but but allowing Our World Views and ideas about ourselves to be dictated by other people's other people dismembers arcing them and severs us from our power because here's the thing. Nobody nobody is putting a gun to your head and saying that you need to believe that the world operates the way I believe the world operates.  They're not the only gun that could be there is a psychological gun of rejection. That is only going to come simply because you're already imagining it. So this is the whole Paradox that we put ourselves into is the more weight. We give to a belief regardless of whether we came to that conclusion or somebody else came to that conclusion, and we decided to respect their belief and take it on as their own. It's going to produce more of itself.  It's always going to produce more of itself. So the way it is is the way it is for the person that says that's the way it is. That's probably one of my favorite sayings because it's something you've probably heard so many times it's something I've heard so many times from people who just don't know how to bypass their own limitation.  The way it is is the way it is only for those who say that's the way it is. So we understand here that the way it is is totally subjective and relational to the person who is determining well based on these conclusions that have come to this is the way it is that it is not any specific way. It's not and coming to these understandings is the beginning of your freedom the minute you understand that you are no longer locked down.  By anybody else is funky limited projection believe and Paradigm and Paradox, you find Freedom because now, you know two things that what you are aware of being produces itself in your world and you have the choice to literally be aware of being anything.  You have the choice to literally be aware of being anything with total confidence that what you are aware of being.  Produces itself in your world, which is what I love.   Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death. I will fear no evil for thou art with me your rod and your staff they comfort me.  Yes, though I walk through all the confusion and changing opinions of men. I will fear no evil for I have found Consciousness to be that which makes the confusion having in my own case restored it to its rightful place and dignity. I shall in spite of the confusion out picture that which I am now conscious of being  And the Very confusion will Echo and reflect my own dignity. Okay. So if you haven't heard about anchor it's really one of the easiest ways to make a podcast that I've come across so far. That's the primary reason why I use the platform. Let me kind of tell you why I like it. There's creation tools that allow you to record and edit your podcast right from your phone or your computer. It's free who who doesn't like free recording software anchor also distributes the  podcast on a ton of platform Spotify Apple podcasts, you know a ton once you get into your anchor profile you're able to see how many different platforms that your podcast is getting on and I'll tell you what them Distributing my podcast for me actually made some connections for me that helped grow it even more so you could also take money from the podcast with no real minimum listenership, you know, it's not like, you know, you you can literally start making money from the  First episode so it's really everything you need to make a podcast in one place. So just download the app. It's on the Apple Store Google Play anchor or just go to Anchor dot. F m-- to get started. We literally just talked about this right confusion coming from others when we want to speak about this stuff is really only confusion coming from inside of ourselves anytime you talk to somebody about this and they come up with rejection or any sort of  Seaming in a monastic you no doubt and confusion. It's only a reflection of the doubt and confusion that's existing inside of us.  Because the truth is where you are in Consciousness the body follows. So naturally if there are parts of you that are still confused that aren't fully confident that are still leaning on the other side of this world. This seeming world is objective and exists dominating you.  then you know it's like  It's not going to help you.  To continue to be confused and this is why it's super important to test test all of this. Please don't take me at my word. I'm not interested in people blindly following the things that I'm saying. I'm interested in people testing this because I know this stuff is true. I know this stuff works. It works for me. It works for me and it works for the hundreds of thousands of people that reality hacker movement has been able to share this with so when we begin to dive into this, we understand that this is really something we've been  Doing our entire lives because ever since you came out of the womb you are aware of being something you were aware of being something whether consciously or unconsciously aware of being something you prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies you anoint my head with oil and my cup runs over in the face of seeming opposition and conflict. I will succeed for I will continue to out picture the abundance that I am now conscious of being conscious.  - will continue to overflow with the joy of being God  Now this is the good stuff. This is the good stuff.  Because you may encounter opposition you might you just might.  And it's your job. When you encounter this opposition to come back to this remembrance that your awareness of being is God.  When you find yourself in this conflict, you come back to this place you silence the mind and you come back to this place of beingness.  And understand that all things are constantly out picturing of Consciousness Miracles what we call Miracles or the work of Consciousness directed wisely Miracles are Consciousness directed in the favor of those who are leveraging it.  You could have all the opposition in the world.  If you live and persist in the feeling of your wish fulfilled.  Not even a billion men could stop what is coming to pass from coming to pass?  That's the truth because Consciousness just as you its everybody everybody is this singular Consciousness experiencing itself? Subjectively. So in a way we're all connected to this. We are connected to the same source of being  very much, so  And this is often times why when we perform revision when we really get disciplined in our imaginings.  With no resistance on top of that the world shifts so easily, you know, I was just looking at a journal today that I was writing in late 2016 about the same time that I'm at. Wow. Yeah. Wow, actually I just realized that very close to today was the last day that I wrote in this book in 2016 and multiple multiple scenarios that I wrote about in there have come to pass over the last three years.  All of them but most of them which is really blew my mind to see and it just again, you know, it really puts my solar rest because this stuff is real and if you learn how to leverage the law to your advantage the whole game changes the whole world changes.  You can be the poorest of poor men and truly fundamentally assume that you are wealthy and watch as people come together connections come together education comes together resources come together and all of a sudden in a matter of years months weeks Everything Has Changed.  These are the possibilities that you have to become convinced of because before these possibilities become realities their possibilities, and if I am not convinced of these possibilities the chances that these possibilities come to life in my life.  Are so small.  So small.  Surely goodness and mercy will follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.  Because I am now conscious of being good and merciful signs of goodness and mercy are compelled to follow me all the days of my life for I will continue to dwell in the house or consciousness of being good. God forever.  Because I am now conscious of being good and merciful signs of goodness and mercy are compelled to follow me. Think about that signs of goodness and mercy are compelled compelled. Think about the last time you were compelled to do something.  Compelled compels a really interesting word because it implies emotional intensity it implies Swift and implies quickness.  Right almost implies. He's as well because something that's compelling is easy to be drawn.  So now being conscious of being good and merciful signs and manifestations of goodness and mercy are compelled to follow me all the days of my life.  What I am aware of being is compelled to follow find an encounter me every single day because everywhere I go there. I am everywhere I go. There I am I am is the door for all that. I am to enter and that which I am aware of being magnifies what I am aware of.  being  we don't get what we want. We don't get what we think about or what we talked to Debbie last night about we get what we are aware what we are conscious what we are feeling of being on the deepest of levels.  So now  your invitation  to list out  According to your current knowledge your fulfilled life. What does that life look like for you.  And become aware of being that now.  and persist in those States persist in the awareness of being that what you are and I can promise guarantee a hundred and fifteen gajillion million percent that what you are aware of being  will be delivered to you in this physical world pressed down shaken together and running over.

On April fifteenth, nineteen seventy-four several customers stood in line at a Hibernia Bank branch in San Francisco waiting for their turn with the teller suddenly a small group of people burst into the lobby yelling and waving guns shooting into the air. They informed the customers that they were members of The symbionese Liberation Army and on a mission to dismantle the capitalist system of Oppression during the robbery.  Bank customers noticed a thin young woman standing near the door of the bank watching over the Frantic crowd. She was holding a gun that looked far too large for her slight frame the woman raised her weapon and tried to shoot up into the air but her gun jammed. She let it fall to her side and shouted into the chaos quote. This is Tanya Patricia Hearst first person puts his head up. I'll blow his head off.  With one customer thought they recognized her voice and dared to peek up at her face. It was Patricia Hearst. But what was she doing here? And why was she robbing a bank?

Head to park ask.com merch for more information.  Last week we covered why 19 year-old. Patricia Hearst was targeted by the SLA and detailed her kidnapping on February 4th 1974 for the first two months of her captivity. Patricia was locked in a closet blindfolded and only taken out to use the bathroom and occasionally shower the SLA educated her on the tenants of their Revolution teaching her how and why the system was corrupt and  To be dismantled and Patricia learned that the more sympathetic she was to the SLA and their radical ideas the more freedoms and rewards she received through the course of her imprisonment. She gained sympathy for and from her captors developing Stockholm syndrome, eventually, she joined her kidnappers cause and pledged her life to the SLA. Assuming the name Tanya this week. We'll cover Patricia's time as a self-described urban Guerrilla.  And the events that led to her arrest will also follow her highly publicized trial in which the world questioned the validity of her claim that the SLA had brainwashed her throughout Patricia's initial captivity in the spring of 1974. Donald defries. The leader of the SLA regularly sent tape recorded messages to local radio stations. He called them communicate. He's using them to detail the goals of the SLA and  His Ransom demands on a few tapes to freeze Force Patricia to speak. She alleged that he told her what to say, but made her say it in her own words in 1 communique. She addressed her parents directly criticizing their response to her kidnapping defries recorded a new tape after Patricia pledged herself to the SLA to announce her conversion to the world. It was played on local radio stations on April 3rd, 1974 in the message.  Patricia stated that she was free to leave the SLA but had chosen to stay and help them in their fight against oppression. She insulted her parents and her fiance Steven weed. She actually broke up with him in the recording referring to him as her ex-fiance in her autobiography Patty Hearst her own story Patricia wrote. She didn't believe any of what she said she did whatever she was told so she would survive before we get into Patricia psychology. Just a quick disclaimer.  Vanessa is not a licensed psychologist or psychiatrist, but she's done a lot of research for this show. Thanks Sammy. According to psychiatrist Tina J. Walsh victims can succumb to a state of helplessness and powerlessness shortly after being kidnapped according to Walch instead of being tortured you receive kindness, you are given a drop of water. You're not beaten you begin to develop feelings of gratitude over time. It wears on even the strongest person.  So with that gratitude awakened and a strong will to live Patricia said goodbye to her old life and fully embraced the SLA. She started weapons and Fitness training with the other members and stood guard with them. She even learned to make pipe bombs. Now that she was one of them defries issued her a machine gun of her own but despite this newfound Freedom Patricia, never considered escaping in her autobiography. She noted that all of the  Sell a member slept with guns. There was never a chance for her to leave.  Shortly after welcoming Tanya into the fold the SLA began to plan their next big mission robbing a bank. They decided on this crime for two reasons first. They wanted to further their mission of fighting capitalism through terrorist actions. They plan the robbery for April 15 1974 tax day. They wanted to show the world that they could destroy Rich capitalist institutions the second and more practical.  Reason, they needed money. They had to pay rent on their safe house and feed the nine adults living there defries laid out the logistics of their plan informing Patricia that she would be an active participant she and five other SLA members would storm the bank take the cash and escaped in a getaway car during the robbery. Patricia was to stand by the door and make sure all of the customers saw her defries wanted her to shoot into the air and announce her.  Self as Tanya she seemed to be more of a propaganda symbol than anything else in selecting which bank to Target the SLA specifically scouted for a bank with security cameras. They wanted images for the media to use that proved Patricia had joined them in 1974 security cameras were still a pretty new technology. So there weren't many banks to choose from they eventually selected a Hibernia Bank in San Francisco in her autobiography, Patricia said  That defries came to her in private before the robbery. He told her quote if you mess up if you do anything different from what you're supposed to you're dead. He still wasn't completely certain that she had converted to their cause this was Patricia's chance to show him that she had the next morning the SLA executed their carefully laid plans at 9:40 a.m. On April 15th, Patricia and the other SLA members stormed the hi.  a barnea bank the robbery lasted just a few minutes and the SLA walked away with over 10,000 dollars, but more importantly the world would soon see that Patricia was willingly involved in the SLA even faced with the video evidence Randy and Catherine Hearst continued to support their daughter Jeffrey toobin noted in his book American heiress that Randy told the media quote no matter what she says and does as long as she is  Control of the SLA we know she is not acting of her own free will whatever legal problems are in her future. We will be there for her when the FBI examined photographs from the robbery. They noticed other SLA members kept their guns trained on Patricia. They reported that she may have been acting under duress and coercion the FBI issued warrants for three women. They identified as SLA members Nancy Ling Perry Camilla City Hall and  Patricia missed moonsault to sick charging them with bank robbery. They also issued a warrant for Patricia charging her with being a material witness to a bank robbery and kidnapping James L Browning United States Attorney for the Northern District of California said the Patricia was not charged with robbery because there is reason to believe that she may not have been acting under her own will but over the next few weeks the matter grew complicated on April 24th, 1974 the  SLA set the record straight sending a new tape-recorded message to a local radio station on the tape Patricia directly incriminated herself.  She claimed responsibility for the robbery and insisted. She wasn't brainwashed. She was a loyal member of the SLA happy to fight for their cause she condemned the FBI for charging her comrades and not herself though. It may seem strange for her to defend her kidnappers in this way, according to psychiatrist Joseph M Carver the combination of Stockholm syndrome and cognitive dissonance produces a victim who firmly believes the relationship is not only acceptable.  But also desperately needed for their survival the victim feels they would mentally collapse if the relationship ended when she reflected on this recording in her autobiography Patricia, once again stated she was only parroting what the SLA wanted her to but in 1974 Patricia seem to be cemented to the SLA no matter what happened after the Hibernia robbery and the subsequent communique is the FBI reclassified their search for Patricia.  She was no longer a captive but a fugitive we'll talk more about Patricia's life in a terrorist cell after this when you're young it can be easy to get into debt and it's even harder to get out of debt.

In April of 1974 20 year-old Patricia Hearst appeared to have cited with her captors The symbionese Liberation Army on April 15th. She helped them commit a bank robbery and steel over $10,000 at first the SLA celebrated this Victory. However, once the adrenaline and excitement wore off Patricia began to see the reality of life as an urban Guerrilla, the nine adult members of the SLA were all crammed into a small.  All one-bedroom apartment because they were wanted fugitives. No one could leave the house instead. They continued to run drills and make plans for their next revolutionary strike during this time. Patricia reportedly had a close relationship with fellow SLA member Willie Wolfe other members of the group described them as a couple Patricia has repeatedly denied the existence of this relationship saying wolf sexually abused her.  However in the photographs from the Hibernia Bank robbery Patricia was wearing an Olmec monkey pendant that belonged to Wolf. This could indicate that they did have a relationship as other SLA members claimed the SLA had a free love philosophy everyone had sex with each other but as Jeffrey toobin noted in an interview, it was impossible for Patricia to give consent because she was a hostage. He said quote any woman who had sex having been kidnapped and kept in a closet.  Closet is being raped regardless of the other circumstances. There is no possible way to say that Patty Hearst consented to sex in the closet if any relationship with wolf existed, it was likely based in Stockholm syndrome coercion and sexual abuse according to trauma psychologist Elizabeth Carl, whenever an abuser shows acts of kindness toward you it shows you some hope that you will survive that combined with the terror of what could happen.  Sets the stage for wanting to please the abductor and eventually feeling positive toward the abuser as a way of coping perhaps this explains why Patricia would werewolves pendant in one of the taped communicate as she referred to him as the sweetest kindest man, she'd ever known but in the context of her capture wolf could have garnered that kind of endearment simply by treating her with basic human kindness as opposed to treating her like a political prisoner.  Shortly after the Hibernia robbery defries became worried about the police discovering their location. They needed to find a new safe house in San Francisco before they left. They trashed the one-bedroom apartment. They graffitied the walls with taunting messages for the FBI. They wrote that there were clues in the bathroom, but they should find them at their own risk. They dumped documents relating to the planning of the robbery and the keys to the getaway cars in the bathtub dousing them in.  Or die cooking spices cyanide crystals and their own urine police discovered the disgusting apartment on May 2nd 1974, but the SLA had already moved the FBI had no further Clues as to where they went by that time the SLA were living in one side of a duplex in a mostly black neighborhood of San Francisco. They thought it would look suspicious to neighbors Having Eight white people living in the area. So once again,  they stayed cooped up inside to freeze had friends on the outside bring them food and Necessities. They continued their drills exercising in the house. They needed to be in a condition to fight when the revolution began to freeze lead them in calisthenics target practice and more telling them that the other SLA Splinter cell's around the country were also preparing to fight in reality the SLA consisted only of the nine adults in the duplex in her autobiography.  Patricia admitted that at this time she believed to freeze his lies that the SLA was a nationwide movement comprised of many revolutionary soldiers. So she went along with everything. She was told to do exercise stand guard make bombs repeat Patricia reported that she was depressed and miserable during this time, and she wasn't the only SLA member who Felt This Way feeling the cramped quarters and once again paranoid about police.  Every to freeze decided they should move again this time. He suggested they travel to Los Angeles defries had grown up in Southern California and new people there who could help them defries divided the nine members into three groups of three to make the long drive to Los Angeles. Patricia was paired with Bill and Emily Harris. They were the only married couple in the SLA and reportedly bickered constantly still the drive was made more bearable.  But the potential of their new lives in LA in San Francisco, the police were searching for them everywhere. This was a fresh start. However, when the group saw the house they would be moving into they all had second thoughts. It was a small rundown house with no electricity and one bedroom. There was no hot water and no kitchen. This house was also located in a predominantly black neighborhood. So once again, they rarely ventured outside fear,  And it would draw too much attention on May 16th 1974 after a few weeks in La Bill and Emily Harris wanted to go out and buy some food and new clothes for the group Patricia jumped at the chance to go with them and breathe fresh air, but the harrises didn't see Patricia as a strong Soldier and dismissed her Patricia insisted. She was an equal member of the group and deserve to go the decision fell to defries and he ultimately let her join their trip.  That day Patricia and the harrises went to several stores before stopping at Mel's Sporting Goods Patricia stayed in the van as a lookout. They were still fugitives from the FBI after all and maintained constant vigilance that day in the parking lot. Patricia's sat in the van with the keys in the ignition and a full arsenal of guns, but she didn't drive away from her captors. This was possibly her best chance to escape but she wrote in her autobiography that  she was still too afraid to leave remember that she believed the SLA was a worldwide Network. Even if she fled today, where would she go that they wouldn't find her nearly four months of captivity had transformed her mental state and Patricia didn't need anyone pointing a gun at her to stay put she was kept captive in that van by her own brain while in the store Bill decided to steal a shotgun shell bandolier a cashier saw the theft and  Fronted him forcing him out of the store the situation escalated and Bill started fighting the cashier and his boss for other men rushed in to join The Fray they tackled Bill who reached for his gun in the van Patricia heard the chaos and jumped into action. She grabbed a submachine gun from the back seat and started shooting. She fired off 30 rounds of ammunition aiming above the fight shattering the store window when her  Gun ran out of ammo. She grabbed another from the van and Shop more rounds eventually the men fled to call the police Bill and Emily ran to the van and they sped away Jeffrey toobin has pointed to this moment as a pivotal turning point in Patricia's capture it signaled her complete transformation. He did not speculate on the cause simply that she was now clearly one of them acting of her own volition. He said quote  Here's a woman alone in a van with the key in the ignition and instead of driving away. She fires a machine gun to free her comrades as Patricia and the Harris has fled the scene. They worried the make and model of their van would be reported to police by the store manager. They abandoned the van and stole a car trying to get back to the safe house. But after a few short blocks, the stolen car died, they had to find another they stole a second car but then  Then became paranoid what if the owner of this car reported it to the police as stolen they'd be captured. It was no safer than their van. They drove into a neighborhood and saw a van for sale outside a house. Emily went to the door and told the 18 year old boy who answered that she was interested in buying the van, but wanted to test drive it first when the boy came outside Bill pulled a gun on him and forced him to get in the backseat Patricia.  Is already inside duck down low the kid was a high school senior named Tom Matthews when Bill told him that the woman he was sitting next to was Patricia Hearst. He felt like he was seeing a celebrity Patricia brag to Matthews about her work with the SLA. She told him that she believed in the SLA as Mission and wanted to help the people. She told him she wasn't in any danger at all and she certainly wasn't brainwashed in case they had a police tail bilaam.  Ali and Patricia didn't want to go back to the safe house. So instead they went to a local drive-in movie theater. The SLA had previously arranged this as a backup meeting place if they became compromised Patricia Matthews and the harrises watch two full movies together, but to freeze and the others never showed up to escape possible recognition, they carjacked another car and let Matthews go. They asked him not to call the police. He seemed to be sympathetic to their cause  And was impressed by them rather than afraid he kept his word, but they were still worried Matthews might report their newest license plate. So they went out in search of another car Emily and Patricia posed as hitchhikers breaking off from Bill. They knew two women on their own would have better luck getting someone to stop when a man pulled over for them. Emily showed him her gun and hijack the car. They went back and picked up Bill where they'd left him. It was now getting  um dark again and they hadn't heard from the other SLA members in over 24 hours. They didn't want to go back to the safe house if the police were following them, but they didn't have another backup plan after the movie theater Emily decided they should drive to Anaheim and stay in a hotel outside of Disneyland. She thought they could blend in among the tourists as it turned out while they headed for safety. The police were on their way to the SLA safe house in Los Angeles the police had discovered.  Covered the original SLA van after the shootout at Mel's Sporting Goods. Patricia didn't realize that when they abandon the vehicle the trio had left an unpaid parking ticket on the passenger seat the ticket listed the address where it had been issued. It was the address for their safe house. So while Patricia and the SLA were robbing banks building bombs shooting at people and stealing cars the crime that truly got the police on their case was a traffic  Violation but when police arrived on May 17th 1970 for the house was empty the other SLA members had fled to a nearby boarding house after hearing about the shootout on the radio. However, just as defries feared all of those white faces stuck out to the neighbors as did the several guns They carried it didn't take long for the police to find them soon a SWAT team arrived and surrounded The Boarding House the police.  Did for the SLA to come outside, but they refused both sides geared up for a standoff when the TV news outlets caught wind of the story. They rushed over to set up cameras. Everyone assumed that Patricia Hearst was inside the boarding house and wanted to be the first to report on her arrest, but Patricia was in Anaheim with the harrises the trio watched the events unfold on TV anxious and nervous for their friends eventually the police.  Lise threw tear gas into the house trying to force the SLA out but they still didn't budge instead. They started shooting out the windows at the police the police fired back and had evolved into a massive shootout in her autobiography. Patricia said that as she watched the live broadcast quote the emotional shock was devastating shots rang out and my entire body reverberated as though struck as the firefight.  Continued the police escalated their tactics. They once again launched canisters of tear gas into the house. But this time they used Federal 555 Riot tear gas, which was much more potent and flammable Sparks from the S. LA's firing bullets ignited the gas starting a fire in their preparations for war the SLA had moved several cans of gasoline into the house the fuel fed the flames.  And soon the house was engulfed still the SLA refused to come out eventually the roof collapsed trapping everyone inside No One survived Patricia watched in horror as most of the SLA died on live television. She no longer saw them as her kidnappers. She thought they were her comrades. The only people in the world who cared if she lived or died Patricia sat silently in the  Well room with Bill and Emily Harris grieving the SLA had gone from nine to three members in one day. This was Patricia's chance to escape without retribution. But instead she declared to Bill and Emily Harris. That is the last living members of the SLA. It was up to them to take revenge together.

Now back to the story.  In May of 1974 the majority of the symbionese Liberation Army died in a standoff with the police their captive 20 year-old. Patricia Hearst was thankfully away from the group at the time of the confrontation. Patricia had watched her captors horrific deaths on live television while holed up in a hotel room in Anaheim, California with the only other surviving members of the SLA Bill and Emily Harris. She told them that they should take revenge.  Eng on the LAPD for what they done all throughout her captivity defries told Patricia that the police wanted to kill her now. She had seen that brutality with her very own eyes. She didn't trust any law enforcement agencies Patricia noted in her autobiography that after watching the other SLA members be brutally killed by police. She felt the FBI would shoot her on sight if she attempted to turn herself in after the shootout.  Patricia and the harrises knew the police would be looking for them. Once they realized their bodies weren't among the remains of the others. They drove South to Costa Mesa, California and stayed in a motel for 10 days there. They heard of a memorial service for the dead SLA members held at Berkeley led by a woman named Kathy. So Leah Kathy's former. Best friend was Angela Atwood an SLA member who had perished in Los Angeles Kathy publicly spoke out.  Support of the SLA is goals seeking an ally Patricia Bill and Emily return to San Francisco and tracked down Kathy. So Leah Kathy agreed to help them and set them up in an apartment. But even with this new goal, Patricia was struggling during this time. She drank heavily.  It's not unlikely that Patricia was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder after watching the SLA shootout on TV psychiatrist tanzeel Ansari reports that many sufferers of PTSD abuse alcohol as a coping mechanism. The Harris is often left Patricia at the apartment by herself, but she never once tried to escape in her autobiography. She said quote. It's simply never occurred to me my fear of the police outweighed my  Hatred for the SLA at the same time that Patricia Bill and Emily were trying to form a new organization with Kathy and her friends. Someone tracked them down a journalist named Jack Scott Scott. Wanted to write a book about the SLA. He invited them to a farm that he and his wife had rented in Pennsylvania out of San Francisco. They could find a respite from their fugitive existence. The farm was secluded enough that they wouldn't have to worry about police finding them.  In exchange Patricia Bill and Emily would provide exclusive interviews to Scott. But Jack Scott had one rule at the farm. No guns at first Patricia and the harrises were resistant to comply bill was especially angry about it. He insisted that a soldier needed to be armed at all times, but eventually Patricia and Emily talked him into it. They were safe there. The police had no reason to suspect they were living on a farm in, Pennsylvania.  Yeah, according to American heiress while in Pennsylvania Patricia brooded over the names of people she wanted to kill she was still hell-bent on getting payback for the murder of her SLA friends, but outside of the Revenge plot Patricia and the harrises seemed happy at the farm. They continued their daily drills. So they would be ready when the revolution came somehow though bill got a BB gun and began Target practicing as a result of breaking the one rule.  Jack kicked all three of them out and sent them to live in a house in the Catskills. But while they were taking full advantage of Jack's Hospitality, they weren't offering him what he wanted in return eventually Jack realized he wouldn't be getting any material for his book. So he decided to send them back to California.  In the fall of 1974 Patricia Bill and Emily were smuggled to Sacramento to reconnect with Kathy. So Leah and the new SLA they renamed themselves the new world Liberation Front or n WL F among the N WL F members with Steve. So Leah Cathy's brother Steve and Patricia became a couple American heiress noted that Patricia wrote about him quote. He did not try to dominate teach or  Demands for me that alone one. My gratitude Steve was a house painter and sometimes took Patricia out on his jobs. She was glad to get out of the house and no one ever recognized her being outside completing a task and hanging out with a guy was almost a return to normalcy. It was a happy time for Patricia. She and Steve began going on dates like a normal couple but a normal couple they were not they had plans to build bombs.  Bombs, which required expensive materials as 1974 turned to 1975 the end. Wlf realized they needed money. They were tired of making ends meet by stealing wallets and eating cheap horse meat. They decided to Rob another bank Patricia visited several banks around Sacramento Scouting For the right target. She took notes on the blueprints of the buildings and the way the branch operated.  On February 25th, 1975 a little more than a year after Patricia was kidnapped to and wlf members went into the guild Savings and Loan Association in Sacramento and robbed it Patricia and Emily took a bus to the bank picked up the bags of cash. The other members handed them hopped back on the bus and went home without even being noticed but the hall wasn't as big as they'd hoped less than $4,000 it.  Even last two months soon. They planned another robbery on April 21st 1975 for and wlf members entered the crocker National Bank in Carmichael, California. The plan was the same as it had been for the other robberies get in get the money and get out leave no clues leave. No casualties. Patricia's role was to drive a getaway car, but during the bank robbery Emily.  The harrises gun fired and she accidentally killed a woman Myrna opsahl a middle-aged mother of for the N WL F members fled to Patricia's waiting van frantic Patricia. Didn't know what had happened inside as she drove them away. They told her that Emily had killed a woman and Patricia was now an accomplice to murder the murder haunted the group and they were never quite the same. They had managed to walk away with  $15,000 but it was covered in an innocent woman's blood a few months after the robbery the N WL F decided to return to San Francisco Steve and Patricia moved into their own apartment together there Patricia was now no longer living with any of her original SLA captors, but her fear of the FBI kept her from contacting her family or trying to return home. She continued her life of crime.  In August of 1975 the N WL F focused their full energies on making pipe bombs Patricia and the SLA had practice making bombs since her kidnapping but she had never actually set one off now. She wanted to on August 7th Patricia and a comrade planted a bomb underneath a police car in San Francisco's Mission District. They were hoping to destroy the police car as revenge for the murder of the SLA members.  But the bomb never went off a few weeks later on August 20th, Patricia planted a bomb outside the Marin County Civic Center while Steve placed a second one under a police car. They hope the police would rush out after the first bomb exploded then be killed in the second explosion. Patricia's bomb did go off but Steve's didn't no one was hurt in the meantime the FBI.  I started following Kathy so Leah she first caught their attention with the same SLE a memorial service that inspired Patricia and the Harris has to find her though. It took several months for the police to put together a profile on so Leah, they eventually discovered her involvement with the NW LF. She unintentionally led the FBI to Bill and Emily Harris has apartment and then to Patricia's  On September 18th, 1975 the authorities found Patricia in her apartment and arrested her. She didn't try to shoot the agents or fight back. She confirmed she was Patricia Hearst and went with them willingly her Strange Life as a revolutionary was finally over at 2:25 p.m. Less than 30 minutes ago. We arrested Patty Hearst and windy Yoshimura.  But in police custody Patricia continue to act like an SLA member as she was a squirted inside the courthouse in front of reporters and Spectators she threw up her fist in a revolutionary gesture in her autobiography. She wrote quote. It seemed to me that I was trapped in this nether land of radicals and revolutionaries. There's was the only world I had I did not really know what I believed anymore. She refused to cooperate with the authorities or tell them.  Anything about her time with the SLA when Patricia was booked into the San Mateo jail. She listed her occupation as an urban Guerrilla. She wrote letters to Steve so Leah from jail telling him how she couldn't wait for them to be together and talking about the fascist Pig police. Patricia was charged with armed bank robbery and the use of a firearm in a felony. These charges were exclusively related to the 1974 Hibernia Bank robbery.  It was the only crime the police had concrete evidence for in preparation for the trial. She was given a mental fitness test according to her autobiography one psychiatrist. Dr. Lifton ruled. She was emotionally and mentally impaired to a significant degree sad hopeless emotionally distressed and expressing a silent Cry for Help. He also diagnosed her as suffering from coercive persuasion, which is the more formal term.  Term for brainwashing Patricia noted in her autobiography that lift and told her quote one does not revert back with the snap of the fingers upon being released this might explain her behavior and resistance to Authority after being arrested. She was still in the mindset of an SLA agent because their beliefs had been drilled into her day in and day out for the last year and a half though. She had been a victim of psychological manipulation. Patricia was deemed mentally fit to  Seed to trial so a court date was set the proceedings began on February 4th, 1976 two years to the day after she was kidnapped. The courtroom was packed with Spectators and reporters. Everyone wanted the scoop on what really happened to Patricia Hearst according to her autobiography more than 300 reporters came to cover the event. But most of them couldn't fit inside the courtroom Patricia's lawyer.  Our F Lee Bailey presented her as a brainwashed prisoner of war he blamed everything that she had done on the fact that she had been kidnapped. He used examples of brainwashed Korean War pows. However, the prosecution argued that Patricia was a willing member of the SLA they pointed to her recorded communicate has the Mel's Sporting Goods shootout and submitted pages from the book about the SLA that Patricia was writing they called Emily and Bill Harris.  as Witnesses against her Tom Matthews the teen who had been held hostage alongside Patricia when he was carjacked after the Mel's Sporting Good shootout testified that she was a willing radical at that time when Patricia took the witness stand the prosecutor asked why she saved the harrises from Mel's instead of leaving them Patricia replied that it was an instinct that came from her drills with the SLA the prosecution also presented the Olmec monkey pendant from  Willie wolf as proof that Patricia had not been coerced. It was found in her purse when she was arrested over a year after Wolf's death if she was truly afraid of him considered him to be her kidnapper and rapists. Why did she keep a gift from him it threw everything into doubt her trial lasted over a month during this time Patricia received death threats and the media remained convinced. She was guilty on March 20th.  1976 the jury agreed with the papers Patricia Hearst was found guilty pleasure. Campbell Hearst has been convicted on two counts of bank robbery and possession of a firearm to commit a felony. The verdict was reached after only 12 hours of deliberations by her jury of seven women and five men on April 12. She was sentenced to 25 years for the Hibernia Bank robbery and 10 years for the use of a firearm in that robbery.  It was devastating to Patricia and her family, but after she underwent a psychological study the judge decided to lessen the sentence on September 24 1976. Her sentence was reduced to seven years Bill and Emily Harris were eventually sentenced to eleven year to life prison terms. Although they only served about eight years of it. Patricia couldn't bear the fact that they had received only a few more years than her on their sentence when  Been involved in all of the same crimes but also kidnapped her her family couldn't bear it either they decided to appeal her case to President Jimmy Carter on January 30th 1979. He commuted her sentence Patricia was freed two days later after serving a total of 21 months in prison the vilification the brutalization of her can never Escape. I'm sure from her heart and  Certainly that those who were very close to her.  And in 2001 President Bill Clinton issued Patricia a full pardon for her crimes today the public consensus is that Patricia suffered from Stockholm syndrome, but at the time of her trial the condition was basically unheard of the term itself was only coined six months before she was taken by the SLA. There's still debate among psychologists about whether or not Stockholm syndrome is real. It's not listed in the DSM-5.  The American Psychiatric association's classification of mental disorders some psychologists believe it's more of a media buzz word than an actual psychological syndrome, but the connection persists Patricia's kidnapping and crimes remain practically synonymous with the diagnosis.

spotify:episode:6VNC2mpsJUMa5F76XNRPz8	 Hello guys, it's me Brooklyn. Okay, I'm whispering because I'm not alone. I'm here with my best friend. Hi get closer to me. Okay. Hi, I'm Jonathan. Yeah, we okay. Just a quick story. Yeah about why we're here together there was Well, once upon a time we found out we were really good at talking to each other and then we after that found out that we're really good at talking to each other in front of other people. Yeah, absolutely and most people I would say like 90% of people have a really good time when we are talking hmm. There are definitely been people who were like, oh I got to go. Yeah, not everyone's a fan but then I don't want that life anyways, so as I started this A podcast like it's always been my plan to have Jonathan on an episode and but here's the surprise. It's never been my plan to have him be on this episode that where he asked me questions. Yeah. Yeah. I really decided I was going to take the Take the Wheel on this one. I kind of thought I would be asking you questions because you can okay, but not yet. Okay. Well, I just think not everybody.  They know so I'm talking about some of you do know because I've had you either DM me like who is that guy about the guy in my Instagram stories or you just already know John? That's just how it is already know Jonathan. Okay. I am the Jonathan that she worried vomited on a few episodes ago. Yes. Yeah, and you may know him as John but I don't know you was John. I really there's no consistency to who calls me which okay, and I don't honestly, I don't see a difference.  Don't understand that there is a difference there. I don't know that like it's uncomfortable for a lot of hetero, presenting men to call me a three syllable name. Thanks a lot more lung I don't know is as just like, you know a referring to a guy by their last name, but then they also don't like calling me by my last name either. So it just ends up being John. It is more of like a bro, dude John and flows with the  no syllabic. Jonathan comes across to a little too soap opera. Yeah, you know nothing. Yeah, I used to use that when I play Barbies a lot as like the guy the gay guy there are always bad, but actually no my Jonathan go to was always when my Barbie was like rich and famous and she'd be like, oh, I'll just have Jonathan take care of that and it was always like her. Yes. Yes. It was fun to shout Jonathan into like the next room. Yeah.  Nana's like what you know one here live no one here has that name?  Yeah, she knew I was weird that there was never a time where she was like, I wonder what that means. Yeah. She know not to question that yeah, um don't want to get into that. No, that's a can of worms. Just like nod and smile. Yeah, he truly enjoyed it. So that one of the main things the reasons why we're also together today is because we just came back from an event. Oh my boy. Oh my golly with out Central, Oregon and it was full. Yeah. That's okay.  Central Oregon is doing like a ton of stuff this weekend. And that's like winter Pride Fest. Yes and out Central Oregon is like the local lgbtqia like Association of like, yeah, it's one like Outdoors it cool Fun Time Event times and it like it's also just to get people to like draw the queer Community together. Okay. It was amazing. I've never done anything like that before. I actually haven't either. Yeah, and it was like a  a panel of queer athletes. So there was Joey who is a coach at Redmond high. He does strength training and PE. There was Molly who is a trans does like bike racing. I would say like a like a relative cyclist like yes your honor of all things. I'm about to just I'm should have I probably already have betrayed how little I know about anything else.  Same yeah, and then there was the illustrious Patagonia. Yes when Wiley yeah Patty gonna hurt himself. Um, yeah. It was what I what I liked about it is that I got to stand in a room and like look to you and I literally said in my head, like look how far we've come. I'm like what? Yeah, when me and Jonathan met we were like till the origin of the French a little bit will go like the fast round.  So that is nine years to cover. So for those of you who have heard the story, you're probably overwhelm. Like don't say the whole thing. I have to have a meeting don't make me sing. Yeah, you have a lunch break Iran. You got a meeting to get to you have some there's no less traffic than you thought there'd be on this commute that you're on and you're like I am about to get to my destination and I already know the story. Yes. Yeah. So the short version is that we were both in college and we both said yeah. Sure. I'll go on a missions trip. Mmm.  And we both went to Baptist University. Yep sister schools. I in Arkansas Ouachita Baptist University and I in Riverside, California, California Baptist University. Yeah, what how does one find one's way from a Baptist University hmm to out Central Oregon listening to a panel of yeah queer folks talk about what it means to be queer athletes. Yes. Well that is  you know, that's not what we're going to talk. No, that's a whole chapter in the book later. Like I said before. Yeah, and you'll be excited when it's the audiobook to because then we'll both be reading that chapter. Yeah, you know, I mean kind of like Megan Mullally and her husband's name. I don't think Offerman. Oh, yes. Okay, like read their audio book together. I know that's so sweet. I know. Um, so I just realized it was kind of like a shocking moment to go back to 2011 in my head and oh dear be like  Don't know. I don't think I would have said no to an event like this tonight, but I think I would have felt a lot more like I'm observing anthropology rising and I'm I'm truly like an outsider and I don't feel like one at all. I didn't feel like one at all tonight, even though I'm not really I guess I don't really know what if I'm a part of the lgbtq community or not. But like I don't really feel like I'm in I definitely feel like my role is supposed to be a lie, and I will die in a lie. Hmm. Okay, okay.  So just tell us tell that listeners, especially the ones in Indonesia and South. Oh Africa. Okay. Yeah. Well said South Australia, but you guys to shout out to you guys. Yes. We love you people who don't know you who are our International listeners or just people who are in eastern Oregon and they're out there and they're trying to live it up and burns on their they're like, I live in Burns, but I guess I'd like to know somebody and they're listening to podcasts. Tell them about yourself a little bit.  Okay. Well, I mean, where do you even start, you know start at the beginning? I'm going to get start stop your top and then you ended your bottom. Yeah.  That's wow. We can't go from a gay event to say not but okay, so I guess if I were to introduce myself and I am I would say I'm from Alabama went to a Baptist University majored in English like focused in linguistics, and also did a double major and Christian Studies and like really zoomed in on Hebrew and Greek and like getting into the original languages, especially in the Hebrew literary criticism was my jam. I moved to China  I was a missionary for two years had kind of an identity crisis stayed there for two more years because why not? Yeah, and then just kind of found myself like where I am now just like I don't know kind of drift in just seeing what's going on around and just enjoying being around people and  I think that part of my work is to do some heavy lifting thinking for people and I really enjoy doing that and that's what I like to talk about. And that's why I like to do and yeah, I don't I don't know. I mean like I play the recorder now, yes because I can't bassoons are too expensive. I like to cook. I like to wear a cloak every single day if I can get away with it. Yep. That's who I am. That's who you are. Just a quick like  A little like pretty inconvenient. Well, what I want to say right now is that Jonathan is gay and he's single and he's single. Wow. I mean just expose me and I'm I'm I don't know a lot about grinder. I've seen screenshots, but I don't like it and nobody likes grinder. No and so my I just want to put it out there if there's anyone listening to this going that sounds like a guy I could be  With yeah, and you're a guy and you're just sitting there being just as because how am I sitting in my closet with my best friend who's literally the smartest man? I know like no offense to Alex Trebek, but this is the smartest man. I know and he's the coolest man. I know and he has really really good smelling hair and he knows yeah, he and he knows how his way around a kitchen. He knows his way around a body. He knows his way around the woods. He knows his way around foreign.  Trees, like what don't you know your way around nothing that seems important to this conversation. So I just a mini plug for Glenn. Can I just like move on? Oh, yeah. I'm hot. I'm so sorry. Okay. Um, so I just wanted to say that a little tiny commercial. He didn't pay me to do it. He will eventually on his wedding day. Just let me like a check probably like I probably pay you just directly in Gold. Oh PayPal also, um, nope. Oh grams of gold.  Grams of gold I except in a chain. I was thinking like a little gram bars like you can buy a gram bars at a time like a fun tchotchke for the mantelpiece. I like that. So Jonathan has written questions. I do I have two pages worth and he wrote them and printed them out our paper right now.  Okay. Wow, it's like you're really here. I'm really proud of that. Yeah. Well, so he's gonna ask me questions because I guess I can tell you why. Okay. So one of my favorite things is when I'm hanging out with two people who know each other really well like better than I know other than like, they're old friends and I just get to like wow so cool to be around old friends.  Who doesn't love to do that, but I love it specifically when those people find out something new about each other that they didn't know before and I get to watch two people who've known each other for a really long time learn something new about each other and it's like I got to be there for that, you know, and so what I was doing the other night was I was like they're questions that I want to ask Brooklyn that I've never asked her before and when you do known somebody for nine years, it really doesn't matter how deeply you've known somebody when you known for nine years. It becomes really difficult to think of things that you haven't asked them before but then also  like the only other people in the world, I feel like I knows well is Brooklyn are people that I literally went to like Elementary School with so as I've like been thinking about these things like there are some good questions. I could ask her so  I'm gonna we're gonna have a warm-up round. Okay, and then we're going to get to the really meaty stuff my love meet you do and then I like sandwiches. I like Oreos like that. Like I like to end where I started that's probably a little bit of my like biblical studies thing. So we're going to lighten it back up. Yeah, so that like you listener you don't get like you don't end on some things like who have heavy lifting. Goodbye you guys and then and then like man, I gotta go straight from the  Into what you know, so then we're going to end it on some lighter notes as well. Mmm, yum yum yum, Daddy give it to me and your mother figure out why I had to print this out because I did a little research for the first question. Okay and what I want I want a heart a hot take here. Okay? Okay. So I was looking back on the mega stars of the 90s. I've been listening to a lot of like older Celine Dion a lot of older Mariah Carey Dolly Parton is a Mainstay. She can't really be relegated.  Led to a decade. No, no. No. I'm she's she has no beginning and she has no end apparently, right? Like where did she come from the mountains of Appalachia? Nobody comes from there. So okay. I was like I've been looking through specifically these people we have what what interested me in the 90s is that it was common for people to cover other people's work on a major studio album. When's the last time you saw that?  Hmm. Okay. So we have Mariah Carey in 1993. She covered Harry nilsson's without you but on that very same album, which was music box. She had Dream Lover and hero like two of her biggest hits ever. Okay, but like I can't live if Lee booty butt out you was on there. Okay, that wasn't hers Kenley Kenley. Only Whitney Houston covered. I will always love you in 1992 while Dolly herself had released an album called Great Balls of Fire in  I know it's like just tons of covers. Yes, who does that anymore? Yes, Willie Nelson's Greatest Hit was an Elvis song.  Celine Dion what I did not know. Yeah, uh-huh Celine Dion covered natural woman just before she peeked in Fame and then again in 2003, she covered I Drove all night, which is Cyndi Lauper song.  I'm pretty sure I'm probably wrong share often covered songs on major Studio albums Madonna covered American Pie in 2000 member that yeah, I did. Okay. So thousand was a good year like the list goes on. But now what happened to people putting covers on major Studio albums. It's gone. We have cover bands and if you completely reimagine a song that's also okay, but you don't see like  Underground a covering that much sure but sampling, right but conversely we are obsessed with rebooting old series. Oh remaking old things but when it comes to music  people will people take offense to a successful artist covering. Somebody else's song. I mean you see Adele With Love Song on her album 21, and we absolutely do not talk about that. So what do you think is going on here? Wow, like emotionally culturally spiritually sort of asking me like, what's why is this change?  Hmm. We are we are obsessed with remaking old stuff. But yeah comes to Major Artistry making anything. It's like if you do that, I'm gonna freak out like Adele We do not I don't I don't listen to Love Song by Adele. No. No, I don't either don't talk about it. I feel kind of like somebody's probably gonna hear that we talked about it. We're gonna get in trouble. Hmm. Maybe this is I've to one thought is not backed up by science and one is it backed up entirely by science? Okay.  Great, you've already done research it just now in my head as a scientist and my own right for my phone small sciences that I've studied the small Sciences. You probably know about them. I would say the internet no offense to the internet. Thank you for being my friend. You're a pal. No, so I the internet.  Made everything so much more personal that I almost think anthropologically that it took a long time for someone to sit back and watch like their music be covered by someone that they're like, well I know much about them they seem like nice girl good Canada girl, let her cover my things. Yes, and you're like, I'm you know, I'm Dolly I'm from the mountains let her do her thing because I'm gonna do my thing and they just hear about it and they forget about it because it happened at breakfast. But when it's the internet you have to hear about it 26 times a day become so personal and so like  Over done it's over quicker, but I think that going into someone and taking their whole copying their whole living room set up essentially would be like, okay everyone knows my thing like the back of their hand. Why would you copy it when then it was almost like what's that quote about the tide lifting all the ships? I have no Rising tide raises All Ships. Okay, so it's like as as I lift you up, so  You know what? I mean? Like you can lift me up like as You Raise Me Up. Yes, so I can stand on mountains stand on mountains. So that's my anthropological one. My that sounded like the silly one, but that was the science one. My like it's an even hotter like spicy or take that we are trying to do this without telling anybody. I think it's happening and we don't know about it because I think people are listening because you brought up Ariana Grande and she has a  Along with a little bit of a said samples. Yeah, I think we sample without telling anybody we sampled because I like I've really gone. Mmm. Well, no, I'm sure somebody knows it's probably in writing somewhere but you don't you know, you're not on your like. Oh gotcha. Dude I'm saying so it's like there are like bits and pieces in a song but and that's fine. But when the whole song is the vibe of another song and you don't talk about it like Ariana Grande's good night and go  go is I mean, that's Imogen Heap.  Entirely I should not have brought up Ariana Grande. I don't know anything. You don't need to know anything. The people know the things. Yes, they do and that's fine. I just don't see Imogen Heap on on there and that's okay. But if you're going to go image and he just do the whole song like go for it and like give me that full moment of you. Just loving the song. I think Miley Cyrus is a great job of this where she just like sings other people's songs, and she's like Chinaman singing Arctic Monkeys get you  Do it. She's not like I'm gonna slip it into my little tune. Mmm. She just does the whole thing and then Arctic Monkeys are like, thank you Miley. Yeah, like as much as you hate my li XI Shi zhai. She has my respect. Okay. Okay. That's my thought. Okay. I love that. Okay, we're going to go into the next question. Okay. I want you to put your mind into public school. Yeah teachers. Mmm. There are certain archetypes represented by public school teacher. I'm talking Elementary Middle High.  And if you were going to be a public school teacher not basing this off of the subject that you would want to teach but there are certain. Okay, so like coaches mail coaches always teach history and health and then they're like, there's like certain personality that's tied up in that for me. I would be a middle school English teacher why every gay man you've ever met probably  Had to keep a journal for his middle school English teacher and probably in that journal came out to that middle school English teacher. Yeah, and you've highlighted this I didn't notice this about myself, but I have this ability to get people to tell me their deepest darkest. Right? Right. Yeah, my my Uber and Lyft drivers like oh my God, like I get out of there and it's like wow, I really hope that his wife gets through this. Like, I'm actually his wife's side in this. Yeah. So when you consider the archetypes that public school teachers represent, what do you think?  you would be  Hmm. I I have always seen myself as like a theater teacher because I feel like my body shape is very inviting to like, I don't look like I'm better than anybody else in the room. I'm I take up weird chunk of space and I had to I knew this only because two moments occurred in my life where like stars aligned I was in a play and I had to dress up like we'll just  Real weird and then when I saw High School Musical For the First Time The like theater teacher in that it was who I looked like in that play, but I remember when I dressed up like that and that play everyone went like this is just right for you. Like you have a bird in your hair. You have a shawl on your clothes just switched to and fro who knows what's happening underneath there. There's just like movement. There's like fat has sway, you know, and mine did and I think in order to be able to tell everybody like  Like get your confidence out and care how tiny it is. If it's just a shriveled-up little little old dill pickle get it out. Put it on the desk will gherkin and get ready. Like that's who acts who woke me up. And so I would love to be that person but also, I think I'm not that person. That's like you'll never be like me but just get used to it. It just shows them like you can do this and probably if you feel like you can't do anything. This is something you can do like maybe  Maybe like Professor Stockman is like really trying to get you to expose yourself in your English class, maybe coach so and so in algebra is and and history or just really putting the pressure on you can come into theater and I can be like put on this silly mask and like give me your best Madonna like we're just doing that today. Yeah, like my one of the best moments of my life is I remember going up to my theater teacher my Drama teacher I  Yes in public school, mr. C and telling him. Hey, I want to do a skit but I have to say the word direction it can I say it is that bad he went I love the word erection. Oh and I said what he was like, you know what you probably think I'm all old and then he sat down at the piano and literally saying My Humps no joke. He just did the rap part. He was like I met a girl down at the Disco. She said hey, I know I'm looking at your like wait. Well I'm saying  geography and China to My Humps with swords with swords  We did that my ears got so hot right now instantly. So thank you. Mr. C I would be a Drama teacher million percent. I see you in a black turtleneck. Yes, like a black skirt, huh opaque black Hosiery like the like black shoes that have like the one strap across the top know what I'm talking about.  Jane's yeah and your yes, exactly and then like your hair up in a bun. Yes. It's sort of like Steve Jobs. Yes, but that's my that it's like Steve Jobs had a baby with a stripper and it was me. I'm not saying anything what you can't say is that I'm just dumbfounded exactly. I love it. Oh my gosh. Okay. Let's see. Hmm. Okay. Hmm. Yep. Okay. This is actually something you didn't know.  Oh that Brooklyn doesn't know what these questions are. I don't know if I if I made that very clear at the beginning but the next one I have is why do you dislike chocolate objectively? You should like it hmm fats sugars antioxidants. I'm thinking purely from like oh and health organism. Mmm point of view got it where drawn to fats and sugars and antioxidants and chocolate at caffeine. Hmm virility.  Apparently it makes you so horny. That's what you remember like. That's why they mix that's why they did it. Right like they it was like, yeah, he make it for the king and the Hand get so homey. Oh, yeah, so it's got everything. So, um objectively. Yeah, you should like it and but you consistently haven't and I don't think we've ever just like really nailed down y-yeah. We've sort of been like I dropped the nail and you're like should we hammer it in and I'm like not right now you're right, right.  I'm gonna say this my audience doesn't know yet that I don't like chocolate because I do intermittently. It's very confusing thing. Most people who are like I hate bananas aren't like but I love them in a you know know right? No thanks to bananas. My cilantro haters out there. It's not like you're going to sometimes be like sprinkle that on me. Dad. I'm in the mood for some soap lettuce, you know, so chocolate to me reminds me of the way that people must feel when they eat cilantro though.  In that sometimes I eat it and it tastes like soap it like chocolate. Yeah to me chocolate. I've learned to let kind of like it that because of mochas but I can eat some chocolate like like like   in a pancake a half a pancake that's like chocolate chips or a little cookie or like a fake Oreo time, you know, but yeah sure. I'm mostly relying on a thick dose of icing to get me through that. Yeah. Um, so yeah, I don't know. I think my brain has like a switch or sometimes. It's like chocolate is good right now and then it switches over and it's like soap. That's that why you can't stop you're having you're eating Brooklyn you're confused and your shower you're eating your body wash because I also do have  I've had body washes that were very almost like taste me. I'm Tasty and I didn't do it somebody works. Yeah, but even growing up like Suave would have ones that I was like yum is that Apple guy have that apple apple moment in the shower? Yeah. Otherwise, I don't know. I probably gonna have to get my brain studied after I die, right? You don't even have to wait until you're dead. They can do like scans. And so I've heard I don't know. It's like really to get into the mush of it all I should probably not be here anymore because what if they like Flicka  thing and that was my that was my flick or and you took my flick away. Yeah, and also like another thing you probably don't know about Brooklyn is that she took a class? I did I did. I had a class at CBU called the history of chocolate, which I think it's the history of coffee and chocolate now, maybe but Professor skubick doctor skubick. I'm so sorry. Um, this cubes he taught me all about chocolate I caught on to his love for dark chocolate milk a cow.  Nibs, and because that's not a sweet and Brooklyns not a huge fan of like no, I'd rather have like it was history of cheese. I would have died on the table the turkey turkey board next rev Dr. Pepper. I'm out. Okay, I would be I've been drunkenly only soda. Yeah. That's my that's why I'm saying, I don't think you see I didn't know that about you. Oh, that's my baby. That's my baby daddy. So this is whores of all sodas. That's the daddy goat Bay.  Dr. Pepper. Yes. Wait, so when you said you're out you meant like you want in I would be dead. Oh, okay. I thought you meant like I'm out like I'm Never Gonna Cancel. Oh, is this our cover? I'm out. No, no, no, okay. Okay. So yeah, that's my only one. Yeah. Okay. So, okay. Well that's good to know and like so and the reason I brought that up is because it's like it's not like you haven't tried and I've tried and it's kind of one of those things like going when somebody's like so well educated on a thing and still turns away from  Mmm, that it kind of blows. It's like well then am I wrong for liking it like when someone like takes a class on it and gives it everything she's got right and she's still like yes, I studied the Bill of Rights and I hate the law. I'm no rights. Nobody needs these. Okay. So that was the warm-up round. How you feeling? I'm like warm. I'm a hot. Okay. So now we're going to play a game of word association. Okay. So how that works is I say something you instantly say the first word.  Word or short phrase that comes to mind. I'm not cooking and for our out-of-town listeners, I'll be listing some local Bend stuff. Okay. This will also be a warm-up and beginning and then get more serious as we go. I'm ready. Okay coffee. Mmm cold brew cap. Yummy South sister. I don't want to go there shevlin Newport Greenwood 20 love it. I knew you were gonna do that. There's a there's a road and bend it.  Because so one of the things that Brooklyn like knows about me is that I can't remember any road names know and like I moved here because we're going to answer first of all second of all as she was like showing me around town. She was like this road has several names shoveling Newport Greenwood 20. So I that like I think it's been what six? I don't know how many years ago either. Okay. So potatoes fried movies all of them D&D wizard Trump yucky.  Family money. I want it God. Please marriage, please job have it. Okay. So the reason why I did that is that a lot of times when people stall in that game like when you're not when you don't spit it out, that stall is like, oh, I've got to think of something like mmm to say that's more acceptable my initial thoughts. So do you want to dive into that because  The first one that you stalled on was God, huh? Yeah, I don't know. What was I don't know what my initial thought was. Yeah. I think my word was going to be no, but I don't like a great experiment. Yeah, I mean so like if if you didn't catch on in the beginning when we said that we both went to baptist universities and then like wow now we are at this queer panel for athletes.  It might be a little complicated, right? Yeah, Faith Journey isn't just linear and easy times now and I remember like one of the diagrams that we did and when I spiritual formation classes was the professor like did the scribble on the board like your journey isn't letting her and but the scribble was kind of going upward again time and it's like, you know, I think that might have been wrong too. Yeah, that was an assumption that it will always get better. Yep. Yeah, and then  Marriage, he stalled on what did I say for marriage? I said like, please please please I mean because it sounds so good. But also my thought I think my initial thought was kind of like probably not or like how how do you summarize like not not my priority or like I would rather have other things.  Yeah, I just would like I the way I summarize it. No, that was the cap the way I summarize it for people for not everybody because this is not everybody but if you've seen the movie The Greatest showman and at the end you Jackman or Jonathan says Jack human I sure did. I was so sleepy, you know, the limbs worth brothers are going to the here Jack human referring to Chris and Liam.  Was it Hemsworth? I think that's I don't know anymore its limbs Worth to us seems worth and Jackie a given set of you down. So Hugh Jackman at the end as this character PT Barnum chooses his family like over the circus and I think everyone was like, I'm I cries. I love it. I feel the same very Bjork of them, but I was sitting there going well shit. I think I'd pick the circus mmm, but I probably that's problematic because I would pick my family. I think I do have a loyalty.  A high amount of loyalty but I would just I think if I had to pick if I could pick between the two roads at that point in time, I think I picked the circus. Yeah, I mean that's complicated because he already had the family right it was sort of like so if it choose between though we don t have a family or like go in the circus. Yeah, right. You would right now, I'd be circus for you right now. If I could. Yeah, the two roads diverged in a yellow wood and I'm going on the circus down. Hello. She went Frosty on us. Okay. Um, let's see.  So I'm going to ask Brooklyn. This is for you listeners. I'm going to ask Brooklyn some interrelated questions that like they sound kind of generic but they directly concerned the things that I admire most about Brooklyn and so I don't first of all, I don't think I've ever told you like I admire this about you. I don't think I think of like kind of we talked about it, right but it's hard for me to just like straight-up compliment somebody yeah because it's hard for me to receive them. So I really don't like  Compliment others to other people. Absolutely. I told someone else about you and how you're good at this and I'm like hmm. Hmm. Yeah, but yeah, it's I have a problem being direct with those kinds of things. So, um, you know in the words of Dolly this is this is my question. I'm normally not this obsessed with Dolly but I've just been really sort of that. She's with us right now. I think to I've got my eyes closed. I'm trying to tune into that frequency right now and Ali and I can feel dolly in this.  Closet I can too.  Okay, so  in the words of Dolly with all your you do your attitude just seems to be so good. How do you keep it? Hmm. Brooklyn's a very busy person and I am over here working like a full-time job and then I work a full day on a Saturday and I like crumble to Pieces. Mmm and Brooklyn the whole time. I've known her has always worked like so many different jobs at once and has  Always been there and present and genuine at the same time. How do you do that? Wow?  It's one of those times here. We are where I'm hearing like that sounds good, but I don't think I'm that way. Well you think wrong yeah, thank you. So my answer for now like ask me again in five years. Okay. Okay. My answer feminine. Okay, tasty re please. Remember I feel I feel kind of  Like I have a responsibility. This is kind of a weird deep thing, but we'll maybe that's what this will get to talk about it another time more but I feel like a deep responsibility that I'm Not only living my life for me, but that I'm living it for everyone else that I love so that their lives can be okay too. And that's a part of my personality but it's also really super deeply ingrained in me because of how I was raised like my grandmother lived her life for  Betterment of other people like never was she like, you know what I need today like and she should have been she maybe should have said that a few times but I feel like I'm living my life for her now. And so I know that's like a huge Grand big scale thing. Like it's a big question. Well, yeah, if you took out my brain stem you'd be like, oh here it is. That's what it says right here. Like that's what she's doing and it's informing a lot of the other choices. She makes so I am on some level. I know I'm like, what's the right thing to do?  Do and that's just totally Molly Wagner like me. I'm so slithering that I'm like, what do I want to do? And then the Gryffindor part of me is all her that's just like what's the best for all people? What's the best for the ones that you love and I'm pretty pretty lucky that and I'm pretty stubborn in my luck. I think that I've picked I found really good people to love like you and I've I've chosen to keep them. So it's a lot easier to show up for people because you just also want to be there. Yeah.  And that's a word that I heard you use the other day that chosen. I have chosen to love these people and I think that that was something that I really admired to because a lot of times in our present culture. It's like well whoever happens to be in front of me. Yeah. It's the one that gets the attention and what I don't see a lot is people saying like nope, whatever it is. I'm going to love that person. Yeah, and do you think  Is that something that you also tribute to? Yeah, I mean, I know it's me to like I know I am I am her and she is me I'm not just like walking around like trying to channel this other person like I do things and I look down and be like, I look in the mirror and see me and her you know, and I'm like, oh cool. I did not know I got to still have that. I think I'd you know, you just feel like you're your own person all the time and you're like I suck and then you're like, well, I don't always suck but it's also attributed to so many good people. But yeah.  don't there's nothing in me that thinks like  Like I'm just forced it. I have to have these friendships because they're right here and I just have to it's like I have chosen very carefully who I get to love but also the people that I get to love aren't easy to love like you're not using for love like nobody is nobody is but that's that's my favorite part about it because I don't know what easy to love even feels like ever. Yeah. I don't know that feeling of like like love to me isn't just like the first five minutes. So that's what nine years feels like with somebody where it's like  It's never going to be easy, but that's the coolest part because that's what family is. That's what like that's what I'm looking for. All the time is someone who's going to still like I have friends who I don't live around anymore and some of them I think I wish I could communicate and like talk to all the time and but I have like a pretty intense tunnel vision and we'll talk about that at another point in time. Like I move on very easily from people that I walk away from I'm it is easier for me to have  The people like to want to be around people I can go and drive and like sit with in my car and also have Del Taco with and all that. We're in your closet right in my closet. And so I'm very drawn to being like physically near people and but there are people who are my friends and I am not easy to love in that way. I just walked out like okay by Pontius Pilate like I wash my hands of this friendship and they like chase me down. Yeah, so I'm just putting it out there for all the friends who still text me and look out for me and like ask me.  Doing and send me videos of you like your kids and like my friend Liz friendless is kids. I've only seen a couple times and they call me Aunt Cookie and she they send me video. They ask how I'm doing and like she it's because her and her husband are so good. I like showing them me, you know, I mean, that's just cool. That's just oh my gosh, that's so cool. And I fall apart whenever I get like a Instagram video and I like how that cookie and I'm like, okay. Yeah. Yeah. I just immediately start hitchhiking.  Going to Southern California. So yeah, I think so to me and this is like very much my like Hebrew literature background coming out to me. I think the core of loving someone is listening and remembering. Hmm. And I think that's something I admire a lot and you too because that to me is like the most important thing. That's what I try to do for everybody and it's just I think that when you meet somebody else who  Whose values align like yours and mine a line like that? I think yeah, it's never like you can't ever let put the easy stamp like that one's easy. But like and I mean like our whole relationship. You can't just like stamp a whole relations being easy. Nope, but I think that like if if my friendships and all these people that have chosen to keep around if I put them on a gradient I would say that ours is more on the easy side. Yes. Oh total is more toward that.  A difficult time where I like you when you like cooking with you taste better, like driving with you long distance sounds better singing with you harmonizes better. There's is what I brought up in the last episode where I talked about friendship DNA. There are just people that you have this like DNA with that you're like like almost everyone else around you is like, okay guys, we get it like you have it. You have the spice your salt and pepper ago record a fucking album, you know, like that's that's kind of how it feels.  He's with some people. And yeah, I do think that there is a gradient and then there is like a thickness to the one end of it and I'm like that's definitely how I feel with you and that's how I feel with like very few people but it's like thank God I feel with only few people because then I would never get to be with anybody how exhausting to oh my gosh. Yeah. It is BET like some people are like, I only have a few friends and I'm just like, oh my gosh, that was probably one of the best gifts ever to have a few close friends because like  Then what else did Golden Girls teach us? Yeah. Well, so like when I lived in China and part of the first two years, I was a missionary and I was having to raise funds and I had to sustain a matrix of about a thousand people and I'm not kidding like it was people from my home church people that I like family friends. I graduated high school with OBU people. So like a college folks and then like,  All of these then there's like this professional Matrix that I had to maintain and then I'm like China. I don't know if you knew this Chinese very densely populated. It's something like I've got this Matrix going as well and I was able to keep it up but my goodness that's exhausting. Yeah, you know, and so that's why you showed up with really like bloodshot eyes and you were like help me. Yeah. Absolutely. I yeah my thing when like all of my time in China came to an end it was like  How ridiculous like why would I go anywhere but wherever Brooklyn is, I mean if you had been in Alabama, I may have been like I got ya I gotta go. Do you want to move to bend together? Like I Googled organ sounds good. Let's go. Yeah, I get that. Um, so yeah, I'm with you on that like when those few relationships fall on the easier side of the gradient, like that's when it's like just  Just appreciate them. If they're they're like get over your beef. If you got beef cheek beef to get through your beef fix it like fix if you can because it's like a treasure and I know what it's like to be a stubborn like a know-it-all once what they want kind of person and if the person that you love happens to be the same way and you you get the beef suddenly look down here like there's beef coming out of both of us. Yeah. Just I I don't know a situation obviously is a big blanket statement, but that's what  I do and that's what podcasts are ya someday. We'll take collars. Oh, yeah. I thought you meant like like, oh no, we're going to the priesthood. Sorry, like not gonna happen or just like kinky stuff. Mmm. Yep. I don't know if I'm into that. I haven't tried it. No. Okay. So okay, we're going to like move into the like the other part the other side of the cookie love it. Okay. Um, yeah, we're back to the chocolate Oreo that can handle it.  I can handle it. Yeah, so  if it's HBO left a lot of loose ends when it comes to Game of Thrones. Yes, and they probably did it on purpose. Hmm and probably also because they're very rushed and probably also because George RR Martin can't finish he can't who could true. Yeah like JRR Tolkien true kind of and he's like, hey Chris, can you just like fix this? Yeah. Okay. So anyway the point I'm getting to is of the Loose Ends that they've left on Game of Thrones What?  Or spin-offs. Would you like to see to tie up some of those loose ends? I want a whole show on being a lady night. She I can't believe like she was so ready to answer especially like not miss a beat. Okay a whole show on a lady night all I want to know I want to watch Brienne of Tarth have her I understand that she and if you've never watched Game of Thrones do it, there's go ahead. You know, I keep some people have sensibilities that are particularly sensitive. Yeah, Jonathan,  he doesn't like those kind of people but there is a character that I love who is a lady Knight. She's very tall. I think she's really attractive. I followed her storyline and it didn't end the way I wanted it to but also that's okay. Sometimes they don't but I want to kind of just keep going with her then if I don't get to see like her have the story that I want. I want to just go with that lady night because I loved every time she was in an episode. I was like, what's that? Okay, just her and she's walking again. She's walking with them princess or a pod walking with him.  Yes, I think it would be a great show called princess in the Pod. But the other one that I really loved and I actually don't maybe you know, I don't remember what happened. But the little creatures that created the white walkers the children. I want to just I want the ancient story of that. I want the ancient story of the like three-eyed Raven and the Really fantasy parts of it rather than just the like  I don't know War man War people want to hurt people. Yeah, Dragon stuff. I would love the like ancient like ancient stories of the beginnings like the first winter. I don't know like maybe a show called the first winter go for it. Oh, I'm so down. Yeah and like maybe want to have as much money as like Jeff Bezos is pinky toe where I will give some to HBO would be like go ahead. Yeah because like part of that with the children and the  Walker's was like that's where they started and so you're like, oh I bet this is going to be important. That's how I met him the other day that said this is like you bet you thought students is going to be important not know the first shot and then you're like no, I mean like their present and they serve to create tension in the storyline. But as far as like what they do, like do they sort of kind of make it past the wall. All right little bit over the entire Series. Yeah. Hello.  Yeah, okay and you and if you start to watch it, let me know honestly slide into my DMs be like. Hey Brooklyn, I'm having a hard time with season 1 and I can help hold your hand. Yes. He's in one's got a lot of tittie. Hmm. It's got a lot of sex and I humping sounds ice when I say I spell it s EK s. Yeah, because it's that kind. It's like definitely yeah happening just in a sweaty sort of Quiz 3 walled building. Yeah almost squeaky bed if your delicate sensibilities can  Pass that right then you'll that's really all there is and if they don't and you just say hey Brooklyn, I don't want to know any more about that then. Okay, that's you do you and it's 2020 and you know, what's something that you love that I can hate. Hmm, right? Let me know what you love and I can go I don't like it and then now balance this is balance to the force. Yeah. I hate Hershey's Kisses. I was thinking of what I hate that the worst chocolate ever and it's but no note in my opinion.  Tootsie Roll, oh my God, most disgusting chocolate thing. It pains me that that actually qualifies chocolate. Yes. I don't think I feel like it's like a Taffy. Anyway. Yeah, I don't want it in my mouth. I don't want to think about it. But I also I would wrap if I had to choose I'd rather have a Hershey's kiss in my mouth now. I'm so sorry. Think about Dove chocolate. That's a good kind of a little like that. Okay. Okay. So next question is this is the second out of the three like cookie questions. What happens when you eat green bell peppers like  No, you're allergic but I can't remember exactly. What's the scientific sort of. Yeah, what's going on? Okay, a lot of food related questions, but you know, well, here's the thing listeners if you have an allergy raise your hand right now. I mean, I'm gonna raise my hand. Okay, Jonathan raised it. Feel free to raise it. Don't do it. If you're I don't know why don't lie to fit in right just like it's trendy to have a food allergy like right don't do that. But if you have an allergy, you know, it's hard to describe the feeling.  Is that you get when that allergy is occurring unless it's just like oh, I got a rash on my butthole then like there. It is straightforward. Yes, if that happened though. I would be I'd be angrier hmm. Um when I eat a green or any color bell pepper any colors any color my mouth area my throat feels like I have like cold sores all down it. Oh my goodness. Yeah and kind of like I force swallowed a bunch of dry croutons.  And they cut me all the way down. That's really bizarre or say I gave you like a soda, but I forgot to tell you that it was exfoliating sort of like if st. Ives came out with a soda. Oh my God, right a bird like an apricot soda, but they've got to say it was a scrub soda some st. You are some styves you are.   Okay, last question. Okay. What is your go-to joke that you like to tell I hate it. I hate it so much. But every time I say it people like hell awesome. So how did or why didn't the ghosts wife get pregnant? Why didn't the ghost wife's get pregnant? Why didn't the ghosts wife get pregnant Brooklyn because  Had a hollow weiner.   It works hang out with so many teens that they're like you talked about a wiener. I'm picturing one now and I'm like who draw it for me ghost? I don't know what they look like. Show me. Yeah ghostly meanors that would be hauntingly beautiful or just like an adult like an adult Casper we all grew up. Let's see what Casper's really got going on. I mean when Casper it turned into the boy, I don't remember what the actor's name was little me like bird.  Being sexual Awakening was like he was cute, but we are talking about ending it goes into closer proximity to a child right now. Well, I don't know that's when we all woke up. Yeah, that's when we were like, my crotch is tingles. My crotch is Tangos. Yeah who put out my fire? That's all I was. Okay. So like my go-to joke also involves a weenie. Yay. So there was a pirate walk.  Calm down the street with a steering wheel on his crotch a man walked up and said hey doesn't that hurt and he goes our it's driving me nuts favorite joke in my Linguistics class networks who was like, her real name was Susan week, dr. Wink, but we all called her necks, which is short for next alonga. And that's like the word for paradise and Old English. Anyway, she had to have some surgery done on her eye.  Time and so she had a patch of her eye and now mind you. I'm in a class that's in a Southern Baptist University and we were all like making pirate jokes. I was like, I'm not a pirate joke and I told that in front of the whole class and boys hadn't dropped, you know, like oh my gosh. No, I you really have to go into character like Disneyland character when you're at a Baptist University, you know, and that's my Disney version of myself, I guess but the person next to me turned to me and she goes Jonathan I cannot believe you said that  she was so mad. Well she and Ira yes. Yes.  Hold on. I'm getting it I'm getting I learned some things about Brooklyn that I didn't know and so I'm sure you guys did too. I learned some things about me. I didn't know and you because you're really good at asking you're not just like all right number seven. How many times have you had Salisbury steak, you know, which I would say hundreds the only the microwave kind. Oh, well, what else is there? Actually I don't was just thinking that only cafeteria. It's only Frozen. It's only  Like Mass heated. Yeah, if you another thing to slide into our ideas about them, let me know if Salisbury steak comes in any other way other than TV dinner. I mean I had to eventually like in the beginning but when God created yeah probably so I loved this we can do this again. But with you if that's okay with you. I love answering personal questions good we can go deeper next time. Yeah.  Sorry, I don't never made eye contact with you this much. Honestly, it's like we don't ever look at each other when we talk. Yeah. Well, I mean five years of not being able to truer like this is doing I was like actually, you know, okay guys really quick. Have you ever seen the movie Elizabethtown? Okay, just check yourself really quick. If you have if you have or you have not there's a scene they like these two people kind of bond a little bit and not that much they have like a quick conversation. They don't have much time and then they start to bond over the phone and then they meet  Person and then they spend a little bit of time like watching the sunrise and then they say we picked on the phone and I kind of thought we did when we were really good on the phone. We're way better in person now, but there was a time where I was like, oh shit, we peaked on the phone. Like I truly was like we Elizabethtown ourselves. So yeah, it's true. We had a like purely like long text relationship and then looking each other in the eye as well sort of like, okay.  Yeah, so, you know for all y'all cat Fisher's out there. That's how you feel to thank you for being here. I want to remind you that I don't know what I'm doing. Although I do enjoy speaking into my phone. I love hanging out in my own closet. I literally yes. I was gonna say I grew up without a phone but I always was in my closet. So that's just where I hang out. I thought before Harry Potter. I was just like I kind of just want to be in a small room and pretend like I'm an orphan. So I appreciate you listening.  To me anyways for all the freaking DMS that you send to me and tell me. Hey, I just binged on the way that I'm just listening to you. I'm walking around Target. You're in my ear. I'm like what for everyone who doesn't even know me and you're thinking I'm listening to this girl because wow what a nice jazz radio voice. She has I don't know but you have chosen me and if you're listening to this, you've extra chosen me because this is a longer episode. We're doing a two-in-one. We're doing a Benihana Chris's Parts 1 and 2 kind of thing on you right now and you're saying  Yes to it which is so cool. Even if you had to take a week and a half to get here, I appreciate you. I love you and I understand that you have things you got to do. I cannot wait to actually try hard at this in season 2 I do have a fancy microphone. I have all the things. I know I've had it won. I know I got it for that thing that I did that time, you know. Yeah, great. So and then big thank you to Jonathan any last words you want to say to the people you're  Big fans now. I just never thought that I would go back into the closet with you. Here we are and now we get to come out together. Yes, honestly, that sounds great. I am a little bit gay. So I guess like I think women are hot and I would love to wow, I like boobs and I would marry one. You just came out of the closet but in the closet, yeah, I'm still in here, but it's so big. It's almost like confusing like am I in am I out? So like subscribe if you can if you know how that works if you don't know how  That works Google it or again message me and I'll walk you through the process leave me a review. They make me excited because I'm A 3 on the Enneagram and I need attention and affirmation from others in order to feel like a whole person and if you want to follow me on Instagram, go ahead you probably already do but try it out look me up on there and tell your friends about this if they just want like a cool friend to have I know what it's like to literally just watch like YouTube or listen to podcast and just feel like I'm  With my friends like that's kind of mostly what I'm doing. I'm learning sometimes I'm getting all overheated because of True Crime, but mostly what I'm doing is just hanging out with someone that I like. So if you think that there's anybody in your life, that's like dang they probably like those people that I just heard go for it. Yeah sure the crap out of this absolutely and if people want to follow you Jonathan, where should they follow you on the internet? I mean pretty much Instagram was so it's like Jo.  0 n 8e h 0 o 0 I will go ahead and tag. I'll put you in the description of this podcast episode. I'll tag you here and in the podcast episode description or details or whatever. You wanna call it and go look on my Instagram like you'll just you'll be there. You'll be there somehow somewhere somehow. I appreciate you. I have kind of a lot to think about still and I don't know they're more questions on there that I should look at privately. I asked him all oh wow, okay.  I did know that I thought you skipped around cool. Well and then in the next coming episodes, I don't know if it's the next one or two after this but I have one coming out of the ten things. I've learned from the office. I wanted to tell you now because if you hate the office, that's okay one another thing we can say that's what keeps the spark alive, you know, we can get through this together. It's a challenge and what is life without challenges. Otherwise, it's just a flat sad Road, right? So if you love the office, we now have  Something extra in common. Do you like that? I hope you do. I have some actual friends out there who are I would consider myself an office know-it-all but there are people that I thank you, but there are people who I do know that would consider themselves the same so maybe this is our chance to sort of Duke out. I love you and tell your mom I said hi. Hey guys, it's Brooklyn. And this is an ad that I recorded for you and I I'm doing this.  Because I can confirm that the thing that this ad is for is entirely legitimate, and I know that because I'm using it right now. It's called anchor and it's an app that I actually use to record and edit my podcast right from my phone. That's right. Anchor lets me not only recording head of my podcast and do all the little extra details fine-tuned to my liking but also it distributes my podcast for me so that it can be on Spotify Apple podcast app.  Stitcher wherever you want it to be it goes there and it just does it for you? You can actually make money that way by doing these types of ads or other ads. It's literally pretty much everything. You need to make a podcast in one place. You can even use it on your computer. If you want to do the whole big setup with the microphone and stuff and it's free. It's free guys, it's free. So like, you know, it's free and it's been so fun to use and  So easy and it's so encouraging honestly anchors like good job when I put a new episode out and I'm like, thank you. So if you're into it download the free anchor app, or you can go to Anchor dot f m that's ANC hor dot f m-- to get started.	Can you handle the heat?  What about the cold?  Large gusts of wind?  How about that humidity, huh??  Anyway, this is a Q&A episode where Jonathan ( ) my best friend of NINE YEARS HOLY SHARTS writes questions so he can learn new things about me, and get to the BOTTOM of it all.   
spotify:episode:1u9tlFPay6KGZsr4dwEVpi	Hello and welcome to the homebuilding hero where we help you become the hero of your new home by providing you all the information you need matter, if you're building buying or designing your next project. We got you covered here at the homebuilding hero. Today's topic is housing 20 years from now. Hi, I'm your host David Bellman president of bellman homes. Thank you so much for tuning into the Home Building hero today.  So again, we're going to talk about housing 20 years from now. What is it going to look? Like? What are we going to see how it's going to be different?  But in order to really look forward we got to look back for a minute and it's very simple. So what I did is I look back 20 years ago to some of the things that occurred 20 years ago in the 2000s so that we could kind of then use that as an exercise to look forward. So let's just look back a little bit 20 years ago and see what was happening because sometimes we fail to realize how drastically things can change in 20 years our mind can't  Wrap itself around that but once we look back and say wow, look at where we came from look at what has happened and where we are now then and only then can we start to look forward? So 20 years ago gasoline you went to buy gas for your vehicle was a dollar fifteen a gallon. Okay. Now it's fluctuated a lot in that time. It was well over $4 a gallon and somewhere at least in my state now probably about two.  42:30 something like that. So gas was very cheap back 20 years ago.  What were people doing? What were the things that were exciting people back 20 years ago? Well, guess what people were playing game boys. Okay. Nobody uses the keyblade anymore. Right? Things are very different. But yeah, the Game Boy was the most popular thing at the time.  Music well people are listening to the Spice Girls. That was the actually one of the top hits around that time frame as far as in the world in the United States. What was going on? Well, we had the Clinton affair and of course the impeachment that sounds kind of familiar right now. So we have impeachment going on so not much has changed in that department but 20 years ago. That's kind of what happened.  Now I cure some interesting stuff that really starts to make you think a little bit in the 2000s. It was around 1999 right around the turn to 2,000. Google was founded. So Google didn't exist before they could you imagine that everybody probably goes on Google every day. Google has all these different things and all these products and apps and services and things you can buy and use them in your home and the technology that that's created. So that's amazing when you think about that.  The iMac people are using I Max that was the hot product the hot computer.  Of course for your cell phone people used a Nokia phone. Remember a Nokia phone Nokia has even really around anymore making phones. They got blown away. They got blown away by the iPhone and the Samsung phones and the smart phones, but the Nokia phone did around 2,000 for the first time have internet on it now. It was just basically a black and white screen and you could I believe if you had it set up right you  We check an email with that. But that was that was basically the first internet phone. So you start to think about that you go. Wow, 20 years from now, you know our 20 years ago, you know to where we are now you look at what we're doing and it's pretty amazing, right, you know, we have things like Amazon where you can go online and order something have it shipped to your house in two days. We have these Food Services that deliver food to your houses and you know, just like clickable button and you know, obviously we've  gotten more into the convenience part of the world, you know, we have all these new restaurants where you basically have casual dining or you can have it delivered to you all those kind of things. Then you start to look at the real estate in the homebuilding market and say that market and that industry hasn't really changed yet. It hasn't really become any different.  You know noticeably, you know, we do have some things that have changed like housing can now be you know, search for much easier online before that, you know, people were still kind of using those MLS books and just starting to use the internet now all those sites are ported over and you can search a multitude of places you have things like house and Pinterest and all these kinds of different things where you can gather information you have access to interior designers through things like Twitter.  You have podcasts like these with lots of information, but what's going to happen 20 years from now, it's crazy to think about that. I mean, is there a really a right or wrong answer? No, it's it's what are people willing to invest in and what's going to make people's lives better or different or what's really going to disrupt the industry. And again, I could be mentioning all stuff in here and can be all a bunch of nonsense or some of these things could actually come true.  We don't know right I mean if you if you said back in 2000 Google's going to be you know bigger than then IBM and one of the biggest companies in the world, you would have laughed, you know said this little thing that you search on. Yeah, give me a break. Well, they had the foresight and they were able to do it. So let's let's look at the future a little bit. What can we see what could change real estate and housing? Obviously, I think one of the things 20 years from now that we're going to look at is especially  With the process of buying a home, I think the process of buying a home 20 years from now could be radically different. I think it can be all done on a computer. It would not necessarily have to be done in person. You could have a completely virtual transaction. So whether you're buying existing home now, you may want to still go look at that home. I would always recommend that but you could virtually purchase that home. We're not that far away from it really to begin with but you know, you could do a variety.  Jolt or online. I'm really high quality one. You could submit an offer. It could be negotiated and accepted could be a bid process for all we know and you automatically contact a choice of lenders you get pre-approved over the Internet sign your documents closing paperwork's generated. Everything is sent over you sign it. I'm a tablet or phone even and hit a button and send it off.  And you have a closing keys are delivered to your home that day of closing and you bought your house. So you virtual closings. I think could be very viable for a new-build. I think a virtual new-build could be very likely as well. So you just got a computer system hit a button pick out options on your home. You see what they look like get the pricing right away and you hit purchase again you go to A lender boom done.  And Away you go and the build starts.  That's minor disruption that I think there's gonna be more major disruption. You know, we're looking at these challenges right now of skilled labor, and we know that's a problem and you know, we can sit there and try and continue to get people to work in this industry or we could start to embrace technology. We can start to embrace robotics. I think 20 years from now, it's very possible. You could have a home built with about 20% of the labor that we're currently using.  I think that's very likely and how that would work is very simple.  You know, you use more modulated pieces made in a factory you'd have to have standardization, of course, but you could have let's say a developer go on and buy a piece of land and modularly build these things, you know, these could be 3D printed for all we know 3D printer prints up the wall section. You take a high-powered drone and you drop it on the job site. It sets it right where it's supposed to go. So, yeah, you'd still dig your basement.  Put your foundation and your slab and then you have a drone fly over these pre-made Parts drop them in. Maybe you have one person at the site that day just to button everything down and then, you know, you have roof sections that come in drop those in  You drop off again by drone maybe a robotic real thing machine that leaves the roof.  You know I can again if it's a panelized product. It's probably cited and everything. All you have to do is on the inside run your plumbing and electric so probably have a person go physically to the job site to do that. And then you know, maybe you have pre-made panels again that slap together and then you go in and you drop in your flooring and your cabinets and countertops and finish pumping. So the interior work would maybe have be handled the same way, but you could you could build the shell of this thing, you know with with drones and  Robotics heck you could have a robot potentially putting floor down. You could have lots of things like that happen, you know, it could have be a robotic program doubt painter that spray paints those panels on the wall, you know learns a pattern if it's a floor plan you teach you to floor plan. I mean, they already have machines that will mow your lawn. They have vacuums that will vacuum your house for you the learn a pattern why not have something that can spray paint, you know, I don't wall.  It's very likely as very possible to do this. Now. The question is, when when do you get to the Tipping Point of it paying for itself as labor continues to increase, you know, you're going to see more and more Reliance on technology more and more Reliance on robotics. One more Reliance on things like drones and computers integrating into their home's so as the homes themselves. They may look different again. We've got a large population of younger people and  Building these big homes, if we can get the ability to make smaller homes. I think you'll see more of that. I think you're going to see more high density, you know, maybe Condominiums, you know where you have a seventh floor building built with you know, one and two-bedroom not apartments by condos. And again a lot of that could be built, you know again, if it's done right could be built with with robotics and things so taking the labor out of it. Obviously, I think you're going to see even more technology integrated in.  We're just starting to see with the voice technology and stuff like that. But I think you're going to see a lot more you're going to see, you know, kind of voice everything touchless Smart Homes fully functional right off the bat. I think you're going to even see some situations where you know, you're using different products like instead of your traditional Windows. Maybe you have glass that is, you know, got electrostatic charge going through it and you can  You know darken and lighten your glass. So, you know again if you're in a high density situation buildings are right in your bio. You don't want to look great at your neighbor you can you know, hey, you know opaque my glass and also in your glasses dark doubt so you can't see your neighbor better yet. You could have an image projected on that screen. So you run an electric charge through it and then broadcast an image on it your window could now be a view of the ocean can be a view of the Jungle or a mountain or whatever it is that you want.  I think those things are starting to become available or being thought of and being made and those are things that could disrupt and completely change the industry.  Why do you have to buy a lot that's $200,000, you know to get a good view you can have whatever view you want out your window, you know, have a smart window. Who do you know who did that? That could be a thing maybe not but you know people said no to Google and I'm sure they regret it. Now people said no to Amazon Nokia laughed at the idea of a phone being made out of glass and here we have everyone, you know.  World now using you know, Samsung phones and iPhones and things like that which are made of glass so don't discount any possibility because something a small idea if it's done right can change the world. I can change an industry it just what is that thing? What are those things and what are the ways that they can be integrated? And then of course at the end of the day do they make Financial sense? Do they pay for themselves? Do they make a difference in the world?  world and if they do  Then you're going to see that adopted. I think that's a little different about our industry is like the technology industry a lot of times. It's sort of a Gateway. So what I mean by that is like Google was free, right. Google was free search it and what did they do that? They were providing you something for free. They're providing the ability to find something easily. But at the same time they were tracking every single thing that you're looking for and building a profile and building data and looking for Trends and then they use that information.  And then they turn that into products that they can sell. So it's kind of an ingenious way where I think our industry the homebuilding industry is more of hey, here's our product by it. And in order for some of this stuff to truly integrate into the industry, you know, we need to see that sort of model potentially of hey, this is use this for free and then you pay for things later that you want to use you pay for the good stuff. I think you'll see some of that the other thing that'll that'll slow.  This down in our industry is unlike let's say the Auto industry or electronics Industry the appliance industry where you only have like maybe a handful of key players. Our industry is literally all small businesses. Unless you're in a big Market where your dominated by a few Nationals a lot of remote areas are small businesses. There's 10 20 30 builders in the area that build all the homes.  And that doesn't allow as much for that type of product. So you're either going to have to have a bigger brand come in. If you had something like this happen, you would have to have a company that built the infrastructure and either franchise it out or they built out some sort of model that you could buy into and take advantage of all these Systems and Technology or they may get so it's mass-produced where yeah, you can buy the robotic Rover and the robotic painter and the  If the Drone system with all the software, you need to import your blueprints into and it takes care of that stuff for you. So it certainly is possible. There are a lot of different ways that things like this could happen. None of this could happen. I'm not saying this will happen. But again, if you look back and you think of how things work and how things are now today a lot of stuff can happen in 20 years from now, so  Really just wanted to open people's minds since it's a new year get people thinking about the future thinking about where things could go. There's certainly a lot of opportunity out there in every industry including the real estate home building industry and a lot of opportunity for Change and growth as well.

spotify:episode:1MsRwBw9XeGvOZp4Au4NIY	Welcome to the college guys collaboration podcast. I'm Noah Laden with will take today. We've got a really fun show for you guys. We've got Steven Carter and hundred Dupree on to talk about some high school sports and to talk about the new and see a requirement otherwise known as the rich Paul rule speaking of that. Apparently. We have a lot of listeners in the over 50 crowd this past week. We got a call from a local basketball star Bob who's looking to get some recognition for his game and is over 50 league is going to catch up.  I also want to tell you like it didn't come through the text message, but in all seriousness, my son and I are huge fans of your son and we'll podcast. In fact, I want to get in an over-50 League have been Scout me just so I can hear somebody on podcast describe me as a stretch three to a player plenty of range got lots of League. He's a 2010 guy good team. Good locker room guy. I want someone to say that about me on a podcast and over 50 leak. So anyway, love love love.  The podcast peace out. I mean look, he sounds like a player to me and I know things are tough out there for guys like Rich Paul. So if you're an agent looking for the perfect player for an over-50 League, I think I think you gotta go with Bob. You can go ahead and email us the cgc podcast at gmail.com will hook you up with them. So Bob can finally get the recognition that is game deserves. All right, let's go ahead and start the show.    So we're recording on Thursday August 8th. Like we said today we're going to go into some high school sports talk. But before we do that, we have to get our guests some on the not top five this week. We did a sports edition. So well, let's go right into it first one chessboxing toe wrestling and  Other sports you need to know about I'm never heard of any of these what it's chat box. I don't want to hear about it. What is test box? I've never heard of is like boxing with chess pieces, or is it playing chess with boxes? I guess it gets quiet chanting boxes. It's got to be cheap playing this is these are toe wrestling needs is just sick to wrestling something like that one bit. He's like thumb wrestling. But with toes, I would I don't like it. I don't like it though. It's like watching.  Watching it. That means you'd have to like basically lock your blog or when that waffle the toes you win. That's got sleep. No, I don't want it. I don't want to talk about that. All right football roof, and we'll I knew it would like this one football referee seriously injured after bystander runs on the field and spear tackles him the ground during now on multiple occasions. I have been this person who wants to do this. I'm just glad so many of the balls to do it.  Like that episode of Friday Night Lights where the coach tackles Riggins remember? Yes. I do. Remember that. It's like going crazy. That's it. Sounds like but it sounds like I wish I could have seen this I should have read the article. Maybe there was a video attached to it. I mean as I would be gold there's been plenty of times where I've wanted to tackle the referee son cleanses us beard tackle though. That's just that's a whole day like habitats that Walter Mitty moment where like you zone out and like you feel like you're doing it and you can see yourself doing it, but then yeah wake up and you're like  I'm into that all right, next one boxing match stopped after Fighters phone fell out of his trunks mid-fight. Now, this is just unprofessional. Yeah, how do you how do you lose your job you pack your lunch box you go to work. You don't you don't put your you don't put your phone in your lunchbox. You don't anyway, so if you're fighting and doing his phone falls out, you know, you automatically win this one right? I mean before fit. Yeah.  The main question thing can be stupid you might as well lose. Maybe he was trying to like, I don't know Instagram live it through his pocket. It seemed to not work out with work out for him very well. Argentina soccer player Argentina soccer player red carded after throwing a dog against fence. I'm sorry. I gotta start here. If you grow a dog you deserve like tens of years. I gotta be way more than a red card. Yeah, so let me preface this a little bit because  Cuz I just wanted to I didn't once you read the article makes more sense, not really at all. But so that the dog got on the field and so this Argentina soccer player picked it up and try to throw it over the fence. But instead he threw it straight into the fence. Why don't you just set him over the foot know yet? No way. He should like because it looked like he was throwing him sideways trying to turn a bad arm it I don't know but so last 1uf Olympics question.  Mark alien spacecraft caught on camera at Olympics. Now. This was in the 2017 Olympics. So I don't know it's been a couple of years there. I just want to see if you all believed in this because I don't I personally don't I think I believe in aliens, but I don't know if they are intelligent life forms that can fly spacecrafts. I I think I think there are aliens that's what it is. I think that's what it is.  Yes, I think there's something else out there. I don't know about like big green aliens, but I think there's definitely some sort of other life form like bacteria or something. There's yeah be bacteria on an oxygen ice Planet know if it's a thing there they have two legs. There are four legs are walking. All right, we could talk about sports edition. Anyways, alright. So let's go on and start with what we were going to go through today. The first topic I wanted to go into was all this research.  Search says you need to play multiple Sports in high school. So why do you think so many coaches thinks? It hurts you I mean for me personally, I don't understand why coaches would think that it hurts you I think it's I think it's kind of like choosing your major in college because you get to college and you don't really know what you want to do or maybe you do but if you don't know what you didn't want to do like you're taking a bunch of classes trying to figure it out and you can change your major and kind of figure it out as you go and I think that's something that  Like multiple Sports in high school can do for you because like like you and me. No, like we loved basketball since we were kids and I was kind of our thing but like for other people, I think that's a good way for them to kind of choose what sport they would want to do long-term or like playing college or something like that. Yeah, and I was wearing some statistics and it's that 71% of D1 football players were multi-sport athletes 30 of the 30 out of the 32 first-round draft picks and the 2017 NFL draft or multi-sport athletes in high.  So I think it can also like there's so many research like so much research behind like less emotional burnout not putting all your eggs in one basket injured less, too often more coachable smoother transition other precision's and overall higher ceilings. So I mean I think in ways it really could give student like high school athletes advantages High School coaches pretty much put you at a disadvantage if you're not there for all of their work.  Workouts are all of their practices like we saw that with the football players like we had an advantage over them in a way because they had their season that ended right when our season started. Yeah, so they missed all of our workouts and our beginning practices. So that would put them at a disadvantage or coach would coach would even say like they were at a disadvantage there. Yeah. I mean from a football player. What do you think as far as multi-sport? I think I had a kind of unique experience in high school because  Was a multi-sport athlete I played football and baseball and so when baseball season was around it. That's when football was start their morning workouts and I wouldn't be able to make it but fortunately I think I was good enough athlete not to toot my own horn or anything, but I think I was I was fortunately good enough to where I could come back to football and even though I missed all those workouts, I was still able to like start all silly. What a start.  And be right there so I don't know why. Yeah, I'm not sure why coaches wouldn't like it. Do you think it hurt you in the recruiting process playing two sports? Oh, absolutely. So that's what I that's what that was my point. Why do you think that because during the summer I'd be playing a lot of a lot more baseball and football and all of my football teammates would be going to all these, you know college camps and stuff and I would really want to go but  I've got you know, a baseball tournament that weekend and so I can't go and I have to you know, I made a commitment to that baseball team have to stay there. And so I didn't get a whole lot of exposure or at least I didn't get as much as I would have liked. So yeah, definitely hurt me in the recruiting process. Yeah, and I would guess that just from a coaching standpoint, even if they you know, probably know that it could be a really good experience to play multiple Sports. They would just want like their player just playing their sport kind of selfish. Yeah, so  selfishly, like if you're a good athlete they're not going to say yeah go out and play baseball and miss this or God and play basketball and I would just think that it's so they can have you year-round pretty much but I mean if you look at the  The list of professional athletes who played multiple Sports in high school like LeBron played football Michael Phelps Derek Jeter Tim, Duncan MJ Matt Holliday, Donovan McNabb Tony Romo, Michael Vick this one mouthful. I was trying to work. Well anyways yikes. Yeah, and actually a lot of NFL quarterbacks, like even some of the like really successful ones got drafted and of the MLB to like Jameis Winston Russell Wilson,  Tom Brady actually did not a lot of people know about that. So obviously football worked out for them, but I think if you're that good it can give you kind of a back-up plan and I mean colleague Marie became the first player to be drafted in the top 10 of 2 separate drafts. So I think it can really only help I mean if you're in the like you brought the example of putting all your eggs in one basket that can help with that because if baseball doesn't work out and that scenario if that's what you choose you can go to football or vice versa.  And I mean it can really only be in my opinion like it can only help because it gives you that Back-up Plan one thing. I want to say to just like from my experience in high school. Like when I was a sophomore and Junior we had like insane athletes playing football that could have been like a really huge assets or basketball team and they knew like coming in from their football season. They were going to have to be like pushed to the point where we were which was three four months and two conditioning.  And I mean if you think about our season we didn't I don't think we did anything that season really know and think about what would have happened if we had those athletes or our freshman year and we had a court and the court in Rashon golden, like maybe they're not good at basketball that doesn't even matter like conviction little gonna is in the NFL. Yeah, it was good. But like we're thinking about Rashawn golden like out there getting bored just playing defense like he's so athletic like he could be a a fast quick.  ADI out there. Yeah, but these players don't want to do that because the time commitment that our coach than any other coach would want out of their players. Yeah, I think for for some of the players the football players. I remember it was a lot of the conditioning part of it. Like you said like they would have to be pushed to the conditioning that we were already at. We were doing a hundred and twenty Sprint's every every day for conditioning and I mean that was like four months. Yeah, and that was rough for us and like we'd been doing it. So like honestly, it's hard to expect someone to  Jump right back in and be conditioned like that. It's it's gonna be hard and it's going to be a lot of work and like especially if you're getting recruited and like your you have multiple offers from colleges for football. I feel like that's just hard to get that desire to want to run for basketball. If you're gonna go D1 and football, do I ran a mile and a half yesterday and I puked I couldn't do under and twice Prince I ran in for my car the other night because it was raining. No, there was a  A shooting in Spring hell yeah ever. Yeah. Oh it was that close to streets over. Yeah. I was here. Shoot. Yeah. That's this is the worst thing in Spring Hill that's happened since like the Burger King shooting write your answer that yeah. I do like two years ago or some shooting yikes. That was a I was one of the more scary ones because it was like right there. Yeah, that's one. We liked what we freshmen sophomores. I remember rightly earned freshman freshman. Let's move on.  So I just want to move this topic just a little bit and like see what y'all think about why coaches are also into going year round for me. I think like a lot of coaches definitely want to build camaraderie and like Community within their team because those camps that we did like we went to MTSU and we'd go to Belmont and WKU to do basketball camps in high school and like just staying in the hotels and staying in the dorms with the guys like that was just it was really fun and it makes it more  More fun on the court to when you're having those experiences outside of the court to yeah, that makes sense. I wanted to so dupes. You played baseball. Yeah. I know like growing up and I've heard from like anyone who plays baseball that like travel baseball. You have to drop like so much money. Yeah time like I was reading an article a sign that said like the lower end for a lot of baseball players like 7,500 a years. Yeah, just to play like travel baseball and like you're gone.  Every weekend Matthew Hargrove. Yeah played baseball, and we never saw me. Yeah, so for me, I only played one year of quote travel baseball on that was for the I think we were called the Spring Hill Nitro, and we went the furthest. We went was like Jackson Tennessee. We weren't like we would like one and nine or something in our tournaments, but we went to Jackson, Tennessee.  And that's where I got one of my nicknames. There's a little anecdote for another time maybe but anyway, long story short. I got my head stuck in the railing at a hotel. Yeah. Anyway, what's your nickname Stuckey? Nice? Yeah. Wow, is it that's where it came from? Yeah. That's where I'm from. Yeah, it's pretty how'd you get out? I had to have it and I had to have two dads Two Dads.  All the bars apart. Okay, here we go. So we were saying on the second floor of the hotel and outside, you know, there's a balcony and there's a railing and so I was sitting outside on the railing and I put my legs through my likes to fit through fine, and I was just sitting there and then a couple of my teammates were down below outside throwing baseball and they called to me and I couldn't see them because they were directly underneath me. So I was very smart and I stuck my head.  Through the railing very Innovative and I looked down and then I went to go back at my ears were like a growing so big that they couldn't fit back through so I had to get two dads. Anyway, um, so yeah travel baseball is expensive and it is like you said, it's year round and it it really kind of burned me out that one year that I play travel baseball and I never did it again. I just played like Recreation baseball.  That I mean and I think that's what it does with a lot of kids. Absolutely and you you even look into other sports and it's like just on the basketball side you have your season which is over in March. Then you immediately start a you but you get your two week break from school. Yeah, you start spring practice while you're doing a you and then you go into summer practice a still going off on and then you get your two weeks off and the summer.  With all dead period is awesome. But in that two weeks you're expected to go to the gym and shoot and left and all that stuff and then school team summer tournaments right after that and then summer workouts and then fall practice and workouts and then you start back in October and you go to a March and so you get you have to go 48 of the 52 weeks and really like you don't get those four weeks off because one of them you're doing a you the other one. He's like expecting to go to the gym. Yeah.  I think that's really a that's where it's tough because I mean they're all kids. But um, that's where they're going to have to make personal decisions. Like what their commitment level is going to be because they have to understand that if they're doing spring workouts for high school and then they're playing like travel or a you or something. Both of those coaches are going to expect them to be fully committed and present at both of their different workouts and games and stuff. So that's just I think that's just a decision. That kids are  You have to make and it's really hard because a you is more fun. But like you want to be at the spring workouts kind of show out a little bit and gain muscle mass and stuff so that you can impress your high school coach. That's just it's hard. Do you think that's what like that kind of schedule is what's ruined sports for a lot of people going in high school. Yeah. Definitely I think like for you and me I was I was kind of fine with it just because I genuinely have such a love for basketball.  I could do it all day. But yeah, I think if you kind of make it a job and more of something you have to do rather than something you get to do when you're doing it for a lot of hours every day. It's just it's tough to kind of have the desire to keep going with it. Yeah, so we'll also played lacrosse in high school. So I wanted to see because that's not usually one of the main sports you talk about going year round. But I mean, I'm sure it's the same as the rest. Yeah, so there was really only one year that  at I played completely year-round and it kind of I still like enjoyed it the whole time but it kind of took my motivation level down. So like my freshman year. I played it Ravenwood and then I knew I was going to transfer to father on my sophomore year. So once my season ended it Ravenwood, I joined this summer travel team that was like a branch off of Father Ryan played all summer. And then when I got there we had so like we did that summer league started.  Fall ball which wasn't a lot it was like workouts after school and then one on Friday mornings and then like a scrimmage on Sundays and then during that I played on another like little fall travel team and while I was doing that I was playing indoor lacrosse. So that was during kind of fall early winter pretty much had December off, but then you start spring season right when you get back to school in January and it was  fun and it was good memories, but that kind of going into my junior year. My motivation was kind of down and kind of burnt you out. Yeah a little bit because I still really enjoyed it that whole year, but I was kind of like always tired and always doing something for the cross like we actually had a spring break trip that cut my spring break short which menu which made me really mad and then I should quit and then I actually ended up quitting my senior year. I love how you said we started our spring season in January.  Yeah, January is the second month of winter because you have you would go back and have what they call hell week, which is like the week of like that's our tell ya the weak of heart is conditioning and then have conditioning for like you don't really put on the pads until a month or so into practice and I was just working out pretty much. Okay, so we got to move on because we're we like 10 more things to talk about before. I just want to have one quick conversation about a you if you don't  I want to listen to it skip ahead like two minutes. Give me real quick. I think a use great for getting kids exposure and playing some Elite competition. Other than that, I really feel like it's a hit or miss just to be honest from my perspective because growing up when I started playing I started playing a you when I was pretty young and I was on a great like in a great organization where it was a lot of they worked on your skills. We had a lot of practices like we would have like three or four week, which is not so  For any team, which I think helped me a lot growing as a player growing up and then I played in high school and you're playing with a bunch of guys. Like when I when I moved here and I played in high school. I was playing with on the floor with four other guys who wanted to get their 20 or whatever and then we would have one practice a week and we would play the whole practice like we pick up the whole practice. And I mean that I understand you got school ball and then you got this but I feel like I mean, I personally enjoyed a you a lot. I mean I did.  I loved it you but yeah, but I totally get you're saying there's just a lot of guys. I only played a you I think like going into my freshman year of high school. So like it wasn't really this. Oh, yeah, like we're gonna go get recruited and stuff like that. Like I just need to get my like you said get my 20 I think definitely like when I played it was more of like the team aspect and I think I think a pro to AAU basketball is just like getting to know other coaches that you don't play for like at your high school.  Cool and your respective school because that's definitely helped me along the way especially like having some opportunities to coach this summer like at a different High School. I wouldn't have known that coach without playing Foreman a you so I mean cool one of the things I wanted to hit was I think a you teams more often than not when I played when I was younger, we would play man-to-man. I feel like a lot in high school it was down and let me tell you in high school basketball. We did not play zone.  Very often in college basketball other than Sarah Creek Syracuse. You don't see Zone very often. Yeah, and in the NBA, you don't see Zone very often and I get it's like, oh we don't want to come out here and play defense. Like I think that kind of just speaks to what the point of a you is like. It's a very offensive game. I don't think a lot of kids are trying to play a you to impress coaches with their defensive skills at all. It's like here. Let me go Duncan. Hopefully this coach will  Amir let me Splash a few threes and maybe this coach will see me and that's the thing. I feel like a you doesn't got it devalues wanting for players to because you go out there and your play four games a day. You could lose three out of four and it's like I'm not beating myself up over those those. Yeah, like listen, I got 25 that coach saw me like I don't even care, you know, like I'm still going to get my offer. I got my Columbia State offer from my adult league.  I dropped like 35 in an adult league playing against some 40 year olds in the guy who was doing the scoreboard was one of their coaches at Columbia State music. Hey, I want you to come work out with us this week and you're like, hey, no, I'm not I was like I've work at Chick-fil-A, so that'll be a no not a chance. What are the Chargers complete for the Chargers? You might be able to walk on stormy?  Maybe I don't know. Can you walk on and I hope they God not. Thank you. Can you wanna hear about my best football I do. Okay. So seventh grade was when I tried football Al you know, because that's perfect time to try. Yeah, absolutely trusted. My dad was like a he was a big football player and middle school and high school and he was like Middle School. You don't want to be a wide receiver because they don't throw the football. That's true and I was like screw you death. I'm gonna be a wider seat. All you do is blow.  All I did was blocked. Yeah, but one play we threw it. Okay, we have I think it was like first first quarter. I was like, we're running a pass play and I wasn't I was like a third wide receiver that yeah our quarterback with throat to I was definitely not the first but nobody else was open. He hits me I catch it. Okay, and I'm like, I'm in the clear I see the end zone and I'm running. Oh, I got lit up like son of so hard that like, I don't I don't want to remember.  Like it was that it was that thing where all the Middle School parents are. Like if you hear a gasket, no, it's okay. Did you do you hold on to the ball? I know you've all I had to do just like nobody prepared me to do one dude. It's a shock like yeah, what do I do? Oh you'd be running gassers. If you are my future my guess. I caught it for I don't even think in practice. They threw to me. They're like, I you just gonna block like you're blocking me. So when I caught it I was like,  Like oh, I don't know what to do with this. Um, it was good prep for basketball. Yes. Go ahead since you just coach like freshman football and like the young kids and like you said like those kids can't I mean a lot of people don't even really haven't fully grown at that age. Yeah, like I know I didn't really start actually getting taller until I was a sophomore and but I would ask what is something that you would change about like the whole course of high school football like how you played all throughout? Is there anything you would change from like  Varsity I think so for for playing varsity because and I'm tooting my own horn again, and I'm sorry. I just have trying to you know, tell my experiences. I didn't play JV game. I went straight from freshman football to Varsity you egomaniac. Yeah, right and it was like that with me and I think for other guys on the team and it was a very hard.  Third transition from freshman football which is right after Middle School football. They're both very similar and very slow. So then playing against D1. Yeah guys hurts. Yeah huge getting recruited by the big-time schools like Juwan Jennings. Yeah. I played against him my sophomore year. Jeez. You're still like a little boy at that point. Yeah, and I was a I was young dude. I remember watching him play in high school. He was like kind of be tackled know he played Safety to Denis. Yeah. He  And we pan we were so close to being Blackman. They all remember that that was the comeback. Yes at home is raining really bad. Was that it? No, that wasn't. No it wasn't but yeah, I think as a sophomore I'm not saying that no sophomore should play Varsity, but I think that you should have like 3 JV games under your belt before you're able to start Varsity. I think that's one thing I would change so you would say maybe he's those guys who are good enough to play Varsity, but maybe not ready.  For the big change kind of help them get slowly acclimated to that. Yeah, absolutely and I might get like backlash from that saying oh, whoa, you know if they're good enough to play varsity they should play but maybe physically they are but mentally they're not I definitely was not I don't think there's any harm in like not rushing the player up. Anyways, yeah because this is going to be better for the player and for your team. Yeah and having them develop for a little bit longer before he's out there. I mean, I think it works out with you.  Because you got that experience by the time of those are senior year. It was like nothing. Yeah, it was Clockwork senior year, but like it was I think it I think that could also go the complete opposite direction. Yeah, so I wanted to do a couple quick questions that are kind of like high school sports related that I thought would be interesting the first one be dumbest thing a coach has ever had you do I'll go ahead and start so starting like maybe a month before summer was over we would start.  Art doing sprints and we would lift not touching a basketball at that point. I mean, all right, whatever then school starts and from I would say August to the end of October. We would do a hundred twenty Sprint's every day and we'd left before and then we would go home. So we didn't touch a basketball from Midsummer till like two weeks before our first game and then people are like why can't you shoot? Yeah.  What do you think but and I really didn't honestly like I didn't feel that in shape from those like they were a lot of Sprints and they were really tiring but I think they could have done something better with like a ball in her hand. Like yeah, it could have been just as hard with a ball in her hand. We were kind of condition but it didn't feel like game ready condition. So before we would actually do these workouts me and two of her three other guys from the team after school. We would go to McDonald's eat as much as we could.  Good to see if we can make it through the 120s without throwing up. So that was a bad idea. But that's probably why I wasn't in shape. I was eating McDonald's before it. Anyways, Stephen. What's yours? Um this I don't think this is necessarily something that like I had to do for this sport. But like this is just so stupid in high school. Our coach made us wear ankle braces and like he was so adamant like guys, like if you don't have your ankle braces on don't even come to practice it was and  And I had never had ankle issues before and so like I wore the ankle braces all season and then like I ended up partially tearing my ACL in my right knee and my meniscus in my right knee and then like a month after that. I ended up partially tearing my meniscus in my left knee. It's because like when you wear the when you wear those ankle braces your ankles like start to rely on that so they like yeah, they're weaker. Yeah that my physical therapist was like, yeah, like if you didn't have ankle issues you did not be  Why you should not be wearing ankle braces if you don't have ankle issues because now your ankles need the ankle braces and that kind of like weakens everything up your leg and I ended up having like some hip problems too. So like that was just so stupid. I should never have had to wear ankle braces because it ruined my knees and they still hurt to this day. He's all right. Dumbest thing I've had to do was probably for baseball in high school.  Mike I will not say nothing but someone might so, I don't know you might know who it is. We often times it would rain as you know, as it does it rains and we can't have batting practice outside. So we'd have to do batting practice in the auxiliary gym, huh, and that might not be dumb because we need batting practice, but I think it would be totally worth it to spend a couple Grand.  Build like a tin roof over the batting cages outside and maybe some Turf and any time it rains we can go in there because hitting balls like on the gym floor as a former eighth grade basketball star that can you know hurt the floor and tear out. Yeah. That is those pretty stupid. Yeah. Yeah, that's dumb. We're going to tell the story. Oh yo, yo, we want that to get out to the public.  Honestly, I think here's I want to I want South Williamson and know that we're still pissed. All right. Now I will forever be upset about that. I am Dickie I said the in this podcast we tell it. All right. I'm down. I'm cool. I'm trying to think. I don't have many like crazy things that a coach made us do there was one time the only one that really comes to mind. We had like a morning workout. That was always conditioning but our strength coach made us like get with a partner.  And we did like a race down and back the field of like you would get a giant medicine ball and one person would throw it as far as they could then the other person would run to it and throw it as far as they could until you got down and back and it just felt like because by the time you're like down the field once you've been throwing as far as you can and you're like pretty tired, yeah, and that was that was one of the things that I was like, how does this really help us play lacrosse?  I guess maybe the throwing of the medicine ball strengthens, you know, like you're throwing on with the stick, right I guess but we were all just kind of like it was so and we never did that again or before that. So it was just kind of like a one-time thing that we're like, why do we do that? So what I really want to hear is Hunters best high school play because I'm pretty sure that me and him have the same favorite moment from high school.  A bar. Alright, so we ran a spread in high school and our offense was our offense always got the headlines and so our defense didn't really score a lot. But we were playing in the first round of the playoffs in my junior year and we're playing against Cane Ridge and what me and John Bane had a bet about this you absolutely did. Okay, so can I press this that before you tell the  Or yeah, go ahead. And so John Bane and I shall to him had a bet that year that if dupes got a pick six at any point. He would have to streak the field now tell your story and I'll tell what happened after. Okay, so junior year. We you know, we're playing Cane Ridge and we were kind of stopping them and right before halftime. I'm on the field.  I'm playing middle linebacker. And I read my guards the guards give a high hat. So I dropped back for a pass and I see the back out of the backfield like come straight for me. And I'm like, is he running a router? Is he trying to block for a draw but he was definitely running a pass or a running route and quarterback threw the ball. I caught it. I ran like hell and I school that was my only touchdown and  High school, so when this happened as he was running you saw the fear on John's face because he was like, oh, no our friend group was going are fresh. They are whole friend group was in the same row. Just freaking out like yes, we were hyper or boy but yes, we're about to see our boy completely naked on getting a key and the student section leader like the senior that year was like one of our friends was named Cameron Vinson and he turned around because he knew the better. I mean he told the whole  John had to streak and it was the - I think John like fell on the ground and we were trying to like pick him up. I think that's how long lost his legs like all the blood rush to is that it was like I'm dumb ass down. We didn't make him. I don't know. I guess you would have gotten like a rest of felony for sure. Yeah ever, you know, but yeah, so that was that was my favorite play high school dips. Like my phone was off before we go to break. I want to go ahead and tell this little mic story.  I'll start it off and then you we can figure out the best time but basically so my Junior you mean Stephen and dupes junior year. We all played on the same wreck basketball team. We called herself. The shark's Fins Up Fins Up and it was pretty much our whole friend group and we had a lot of chemistry. And yeah, and we all played really well together. Like we just had a really solid team. Yeah, and so nobody ever like compete like it wasn't really a competition because right basketball obviously not very not a high competition.  So we're in the semi-finals of like that wrecked tournament or whatever and half of our team is on a church trip. Yeah. It's like jack-ay Bears Gone John Baines gone, Jacob Bells gone Deep Deuce was our Center that naive starsin. Yeah, Jackie birds like six to I'm 510. So I sent so this this not it was me Steven Matthew dupes and been heart. Yeah that we had we had illegally put Charlie worth on our DNA.  Who else Jackson Jackson twaddle? They didn't play a minute. Sorry guys, but like but they they were on our team because we only had five and we just needed to make sure so we're going on this we're going through this game. We've actually played this team before Clapton by 40 the we beat a really bad. I remember in that game. The one of their players walked up to me and bump me a little bit and I fell over and the ref turned around and gave them a technical. So there they were already already already. I was I was so  At you for that I hated that but like that that first game that's when he looked at dupes. We're on the free throw line. You said he said I'm gonna  There's some yeah. I said, please don't I said, I'm gonna bleep that whole part out. Okay, because you know, but I'm gonna bleep his name out to yeah. Okay, that's fine from from now on will refer to him as Jeff Jeffrey Jeff Carter Jeff Carter coach Coach Jeff Carter, if you're listening this shout out man. Shouts. What are you up to JC? Anyways, so we clapped on the first game. I don't think they already like don't like us because of my immature.  Move but second game were short-handed. I think like we're all like having a great game this game and I think it's pretty close though because it was close the majority of the game until the very end because they're player Jeff quote-unquote is like nail and shots from like the volleyball line. And so it's like the third quarter of the game. I remember they're really good player. Jeff comes down and pulls the three and I'm  For some reason I was on him. I don't know if we were playing Zone but he came down on me like grabbed my neck and like pulled me to the ground. Yeah, and then I'm looking up at the ref because I don't know if they're calling anything else about to like be pissed and all I know from there was the ball rolled over to Stephens dad and you can tell the rest story. Okay, wasn't so it rolls over to my dad. So naturally like my dad picks it up and this guy Jeff as my dad is going to hand the ball to the r if he comes over.  My dad and smacks it out of his hand and then Jeff's dad looks at my dad and goes. Hey, don't you ever touch my son like that again? And I just want to say something Stephens. Dad is the nicest person on the planet. Absolutely every yeah. So Jeff's dad was like don't ever touch my son like that ever again. And then Jeff like it's about to swing at my dad Hunter dupes. He comes out of nowhere and grabs this kid. Yeah, and then  unlike at that point like the rest is history. Everything cleared benches bleachers everything thing. I looked I was a man on the ground this point because I'm just like it was like happened so fast and I look over and all I saw was dupes flying boom Tate like saves the day but then like the whole gym collapses and people are throwing people are not swinging. I was pushed up against the wall and I saw another friend of ours cold humor was on that team. I don't know if you guys remember Kohinoor came up and  Tried to like get me out of there and Jeff throws a punch and hits coal in the face. And so I and cold like I love you guys, but Cole is my best friend. Yeah, and so I'm like he did not Jeff Jeff's like is basically what was in my mind. I saw I saw that Dynamic like happened because like I saw you grab coal and like you I saw you protecting Co like that mode that you were in there was insane. I loved you for that. Yeah.  Yeah, I have already to means it died down really quick because then the cops are running. Yeah, we yeah, we got a player has scored again squirt out because like no. Yeah a real kid said he was gonna and dupes lightweight today in the game there. Yeah, and then we got suspended. But yeah, it's likely after this like we're all just trying to get back to our families. I'm trying to get home. So we all get we we all get home after that and we get an email the next morning from the the person who runs the league who sucks.  Like we did not like them they accused us of a lot of stuff things, but they basically were like hey y'all are y'all are done and we're like we did nothing and that was our last year to play rack like we were too old the next year. We were too old our senior year Yang and then you know, they cut that League out my God, there's no longer you 17. Yeah, they cut the legal because of the fight because of us. Yeah it kind of what kind of dogs it's sick. Anyways, um, let's take a break.

We use anchor for this podcast, and we absolutely love it.  Okay. So let's go ahead and get back to the show. So this week I think there's this week or maybe last week and the past two weeks. Um, the NCAA made they basically made a new requirement that agents have to have a bachelor's degree. So and they have to have these like these other certifications and it's got a lot of backlash especially from like LeBron Chris Paul Darius Garland tweeted about it even like Kevin Hart tweeted about it. Tristan Thompson miles Bridges because rich people  Is a big NB a-- agent if you don't know and he didn't go to college she doesn't have a degree or anything. And so the NCAA made this role and basically everyone super upset about it. I see both sides of the argument one way is the NCAA. They're trying to keep the sketchiness away from these athletes because they don't want them to get scammed or these cuz have random like guys come up to you and be like, hey, let me be your agent.  And it could set them off for the worse. Some people also think it's in response to Rich Paul one theory is that it would prevent him from getting future agents because Paul represents Darius Paisley and he negotiated a contract with him to make a million dollars as an intern for New Balance which allowed him to train for the NBA while skipping College altogether. He was the number 23 piglet draft, but there's a theory that the NCAA is making this rule.  For him and agents like him. I just want to see where y'all stood on this whole debate. I don't know. I mean me I feel like me more than anyone else like I'm a huge advocate for the college education and like I've absolutely loved my college experience and I wouldn't go back and do anything differently. But um, I don't know like Rich Paul. He's obviously been very successful like representing LeBron and like bunch of other people and like he I mean he didn't go to college so  It's just kind of hard to say because there are people who have been really successful like even LeBron like he's a successful and be a player. He never went to college. So like I think it's just it's a tough limitation to look at because I feel like that that's what it is. Like it's a limitation to a lot of people who either don't want to go to college or maybe like don't have the money to go to college because if you're not like a D1 Prospect or something if you just like want to make friends like be an agent or something and you don't have the money or the means to go to college then like  How else like how else can you do it? Right? I think the I don't know if the bachelor's degree is cool. I liked certifications and I think maybe the NCAA should come out with a statement or or say something makes some sort of public class or a background or like background like a background check and an application just like regular job and then you would get into these couple of classes that would teach you a lot about the industry stuff like that.  At yeah, and that way you made a weed out for your maybe that could come, you know, maybe give scholarship opportunities for stuff like that. I don't know there needs to be you know, it's just creating more jobs. Yeah, I think I think that's the filter that it needs in like the filter that would really work because that kind of weeds out people who like our kind of doing it to scam young like naive players because if they're like, yeah, I'm willing to get this certification. I'm willing to go to these classes then like they're like, they're really in this and this is what they want to do so that kind of leads  People are like no. I just want to make some money off these kids, right? Yeah. I could I kind of see it as I think it could definitely help keep some of that out of just guys who are trying to make quick money. But also, I mean, you still everyone wants to make money. So I would think that it wasn't completely stop some of these guys from even if they're very certified have a college education. I mean, I think there would still be some of those people out there who would want to kind of use the players to their own Advantage so I don't know and  I don't know why they really did it now because if you're just talking about rich Paul, like he has shown that you don't really need that to be a successful agent. Right the way I look at it is I always see the NCAA trying to I think they're trying to further restrict these players and control these players because a lot of the things they do it seems that it goes that way if you can get in the position that rich Paul did without a bachelor's degree and you can work up to that position. I mean, I think you deserve it.  Like I like the idea of more certifications more bat like a background check applications, but at the end of the day if you can get a job like that without a degree there shouldn't be more holding you back from that. It's already hard enough. Like there's not a bunch of Rich Pahl's out there, right? There's Rich Paul and especially like if they're if they're only using Rich Paul as a reference for adding the bachelor's degree in the extra certification. He's like, he's one scenario. Yeah in which like in which they're looking at. So like  He's a bad scenario for their case. Yeah, it's like I just don't understand where they're coming from. Like why are they looking at this as such a negative thing? I and I also like understand they're trying to help these players by not letting him get scammed. But also they're adults at this point. There's a chance that we like same chances of us getting scammed. They can be careful. They are there like men at this point. They can take care of themselves if they get scammed.  That's on their fists - yeah should be on the yeah, you mean you don't support any Nigerian Prince's? Yeah, and I'm just wondering if like at the beginning of the summer one of the top recruits for the 20. I think was it 2020 class? Yeah said that he skipping college to go play in New Zealand overseas so that he can actually make money while still training where he want to be able to in college and maybe like this guy Darius Paisley if he's good enough to be a top 25 pick, but he ended up  Skipping college and just training for the draft if they simply just trying to restrict that to where there's more agents that are focused on getting them through college and doing everything kind of by the book. I'm just wondering if that was kind of their motivation behind this because they haven't really said why they're doing this they just kind of change that rule and everyone's confused about it. Would that affect players like RJ Hampton like what he's doing, but that's what I'm saying is like maybe that kind of sparked it but would that  Even change because I don't think that's not scamming them out of a college education or anything. The I mean it is telling them not to go to college but it's still helping the player. They're making money for themselves off of their basketball skills while still getting better for the next level and I mean to be honest most of these players it's not going to change they'll still do it under the table. Like that's how a lot of these agents operate. Anyways. Yeah, and this is our Johansen even tweeted. He was in CA sucks. That's why I'm not  The swam in what New Zealand getting paid and guys are always going to want the opportunity if they can to make money rather than not make money. All right. So we like to have all of our guests tell one of the one of their best craziest worst college stories. Either of you want to go first. I go ahead one night was my roommates birthday. And so we were having a little party for him a little get-together one of our friends who's a girl goes into his room like to take a nap.  Because she's tired or something or whatever and our twin beds in our dorm room likes it kind of high up and she was so out of it. She fell hit her head on the corner of his nightstand like the corner. It's like wood and it's like sharp and so no one knows this for like 15 minutes and then my other roommate goes in there sees her and comes back in he says, hey just you know, so, you know  So and so whatever her name is is also dead by the way. We're like wait what so we go in there? And she's like on the floor crying her eyes out because it hurts so bad. And so we're like, this is a really bad situation because she did hit her head. We knew that long story short me and my friend whose birthday it was had to stay up all night to make sure she didn't fall asleep because she might have had a concussion and she could have slipped into a coma. Oh my God. Yeah.  Oh, is she? Okay. Yeah, she's fine. It's like them out but just like that feeling like yeah. Well, thanks for that terrifying story. Um Stephen cheese. Do you have anything insane like that? No, not even close but one time this was actually this I mean this is pretty scary from my perspective. So we were me and a few friends like we had like seven people in a car and like my friends. He's literally like terrible driver and so like we had seven people in the car and I was sitting in the front.  See with one of my buddies and I was like how many seats are in like they're five. Okay, so it's like you're stacking it up. Yeah. So like I was basically like squished up against the door and this guy like we were turning left out onto Main Street and it was like traffic was crazy and like like there's always like a lot of cars going out on that road and my friend who I was sitting with he was like right here with me and the front seat decides as we're turning left.  Left to open the door and like so I like em on the door. So I like basically fall out of the car and he's like holding me as we're turning left and like my face is about to just like scrape against the pavement as we're driving and like I thought I was about to have like my last breath. I thought I was gonna die. He pulls me back in we close the door and he's like  Wasn't that great and I was like no, I thought like I almost died. Like I literally almost done. He's like you like know that was fun. You're an all Psychopaths shout out Anderson Venice. Do you remember in high school like sophomore year when we were at a birthday party and we were driving through a field for some reason and you were there for some reason on the hood of the car. I got on the hood of the car. We're driving like in a bumpy field and our friend Jack striving like a  A maniac like he was doing donuts with him on the nobody asked him to do this and Stevens like hanging Lon and I'm out the sunroof. Hang on a Stephen because no but Jack I'm like Jack so down. He's like no so like I'm holding on the Stephen but you could have gone like under that. Yeah and like got trampled by the way. That's how a lot of people in our County like, that's cool. We gotten seriously injured. You're like killed so like yeah, it's terrifying. Yeah. I never did that again. No, but it's good.  Anyways, um, this was awesome we need to do this again. Yeah, sure. So next week. I'm moving into school this weekend Wells moving in next weekend. So we're actually going to record our podcast hopefully Saturday night after he moves in we're going to be tired, but we're going to do it might have Chuck on. Yeah. I'll see what he's up to.

Well Shelley has accused you of having gay girl hair before which I Adore we do have I mean if we're going to put a sexual orientation on hair. Yay girls. Definitely the way that it would be classed. We should probably take pictures. Oh, yeah. I mean people are going to want to know, you know, they're going to it's a whole look it's cultivated. So I'm not going to cut this out. Don't don't get this out Dan leave it in damping then Diana's her mic because we ordered more mics because we're going to have more guests on in July, but  And as Mike she brought from home because she also has a pocket on the second. But right now it's sitting on a Goldfish crackers box nothing but the best rocket bring your own microphone and we use a goldfish box to set it up. It takes a village and Goldfish crackers.

So if you're feeling like you need another friend out there. Yeah realm you look them up really what we're doing. We're just hanging out and talking.  And just being people and it's great. They talk about everything the everything out and chat and it's very welcoming. It's like grab a cup of coffee sit down with your friends and have a good time. That's what we do. That's greatly recommend from the Latter-Day lesbians. Yeah. All right. I always say people say the latter day lesbians, but I am the only Latter-Day lesbian guilt by association. Look, you're right people. They add an S to the end. Now, there's just one they do the Columbus together like so it's the latter day lesbians. Well, that's okay. What are they gonna do the latter day lesbian and  Her girlfriend, Angela Merkel longer and longer. Okay, you're right. You have a podcast called Leonard a lesbian. Seriously, that's fair and just so much easier. Okay, if we are delighted in lesbians done great accept it. It's really a cane what really is the latter day. So yeah, I mean she was saved for the latter days. Let's be very clear. It's all a construct. So are you trying to say you're starting to think it's all fake?  Is that I say something about it being a construct on my podcast every week and I'm just realizing right now. It's just my version of say I'm starting to believe itself and it's a t-shirt that says I'm starting to believe it's all just a construct. Yes that trips off the tongue. It doesn't just roll right there does well, should we get a few housekeeping details out of the way, where shall we be? Oh what lets you know, what did we do last week anything? Oh, what did we do? We are so  Cole's July 4th weekend Fourth of July. We were invited to a pool party friend of mine. We went there and that was an Alexandria Virginia go visit actually don't it's so crowded there seriously. Yeah, it's true. And if it's July like it is right now disgustingly and oppressively hot. Yes balls and swampy kind of like it is in this Den right now. We're recording nothing compared to the pool party enjoying are you? Okay? Yeah plan is finally warming up my mom but later that.  Nearly went over to the kids and we shot off some fireworks. Yeah, that was a good time. That's like to say I was the superhero of the firework show because we stopped at a fireworks booth and I bought like this round frog head firework firework. I don't I don't know. I don't know go with like a frog head with an open mouth and eyes and then the thing starts like shooting off shit the eyes glow in the mouth closed. So that is really unnerving. You're right because there were two of them sitting  At the end and just looked it looked like those shrunken heads sitting on a platter and will be our oh, thank you too. And you know, I thought they just needed better marketing because I was thinking, oh, the only thing that they did was glowed and I was like that is not fun, but they didn't talk about all the different things that these frogs. Yeah fucking minute and a half of things shooting on the frogs head and sippy sounds and mean I'm not entirely sure why we're doing the fireworks anyway, so I guess they might as well just get real weird real weird with it.  Um, and then not that day but your youngest daughter had an interesting thing to say about me recently I've got that was so funny. Do you not talked about this yet? It was awesome. I don't think you have a double talk about it in case we didn't so driving in the car and Cassidy smashy we go. She goes by smashes well and fill up everyone's favorite you're sitting there and I think they're discussing boys and girls or whatever and then casting you having some gender discussion discussions as you do when you're six in eight.  And I was the only one in the car. Mary wasn't with me and then she goes hey mom so Mary's not actually a boy right just based on TV. Yeah. I'm like no she is a girl. Okay, she laughs and then they continue the discussion that boys can marry boys and girls can marry girls. Yeah. Well give me them and Rising generation called boobs Cassidy quote Erin Brockovich, although I don't think there was any discussion about whether she was a lady. I think it was just like eyes  Lou whatever that was good. Uh-huh. We can we basically sat on couches and did podcast he stuff went got some beer Caboose Friday night with old gym friends. And there you go there you have it man anything spectacular from your end. No, let me guess swim meets and kids and women died meets children at the pool and some fireworks that about sums it up there, right? Yeah Suburban life, you know what heavy on the bourbon life?  Anything to get you through a village of bourbon. Yeah, they missed that takes a village conversation earlier. So that's not actually called back because that was headed that was deleted. I thanks for the correction. We didn't talk about the goldfish on the second take really did. We did we so confused. I don't know we had to start over because we had technical poor Jan. Hi Dan. Good luck editing this one. By the way Holland leave a note.  That's right. Leave it leave it leave it on if there's anything glaringly weird later, you can throw that out I guess but oh speaking of beer and bourbon we should talk about well, at least the beer part are 100K already. So LDL listeners and actually have bourbon there. That's true. Do you remember when we had this the 50k party while ago I remember it. Do you remember it? We are like three downloads away a few.

Oh, yeah you Mary did you know this Oh, you mean afterwards? Yeah, they just finish and then they just walk down the steps and no one can even acknowledge Inland. That's typical of a lot of churches. Really? Yes. Mmm, that is our to me. I am 100% sure in my heart that Jesus clap for all the fun shit. I mean, first of all you want after himself upon made wine. I was like, yeah Jesus I did it right my Jesus would it seems  We're not acknowledge. So are you excited performer? And then you walk down and squares knowns clapping? It depends on the church. Okay. Well you're in charge is you are not allowed to clap. You also can't you have to get special permission to do any kind of a guitar only. Yes, you didn't know so this one could had to get permission from the stake president to play. I'm a Child of God on his acoustic guitar as a musical number because guitars not allowed horns are not allowed as basically piano organ flute.  The violin I mean in the weekly Services, yes. Yeah, there's like sometimes of those special musical number. So in my ward in New Mexico growing up there was a lady that lived in that was in the warden. She was in Opera person opera singer and nothing is opera singers, but she was not fantastic and I'm sure if she wasn't performing at the Met and early childhood.

That's it. There was no yes the whole time and she would get up and you would see all the kids covering their ears, right? And so she does a song man and like walks silently down to sit back down while babies are crying.  Immediately. I'm transported like right you get it, right? Yeah. Oh, yeah for sure. Lordy.

Okay you go if anyone of you is faltering and your faith I ask you the same question that Peter asked to whom shall you go if you choose to become inactive or to leave the restored Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, where will you go?  What will you do the decision to walk no more with the church members and the Lord's chosen leaders will have a long-term impact that cannot always be seen right now.  There may be some Doctrine some policy some bit of history that puts you at odds with your faith. And you may feel that the won't only way to resolve that inner turmoil right now is to walk no more with the Saints.  If you live as long as I have you'll come to know that things have a way of resolving themselves and inspired inside or Revelation May shed new light and inside on an issue. Remember the restoration is not an event, but it continues to unfold that was special. So it's always it just to be real clear. It's always your fault. I know you just should have stuck it out longer. Yeah.  And if things aren't going well, the restoration apparently is ongoing so you should just keep stick stick with it. No matter how much you are hurt by or that things seem wrong to you. This is ongoing and just stick with it where else word what else would you do where else would you go one thing? I noticed that he said was that things have a way of resolving themselves as we get new insight like whoa. Whoa whoa, whoa, whoa who's getting the Insight? Yeah, and by the way your  There's no way that you are able to explain to me. Why black people can't have the priesthood or why Joseph Smith married 14 year olds. It's not like like you're never giving a reason to why I fucked up things were actually not fucked are certainly not apologizing for that. Exactly. So the new installing. Hey, you know what? We are realizing now that this was wrong what we did you'd be keeping your members you dumbasses but you refuse to apologize. So yeah. Well, here's what I don't really understand about this new insight anyway, so it's not like  Other Christians are trying to bring new insight into the Bible. For instance. Like the there's nothing that's changing right maybe their stance on women ministers is chain. What do other Christian religions claim to have a prophet that speaks? No, it's just the Mormons. So that's why I'm always getting close. What do they say that he's like, I think there's some sort of like ordination get there. Let's be honest most cast that Catholics that I know don't think that the pope speaks for God.  It's not the same kind of a Mormon thinking the prophet speaks forgot. It's different. It's my favorite be supposed to get here. Isn't he supposed to just be like giving his interpret like he's interpreting things but not necessarily receiving ongoing Revelation, but it's kind of like well, there's my take on it maybe but I really feel like he's supposed to be ordained kind of like the Royals they are real too so resident.  Prince Harry is like really in charge of shit. There's something that's not even the right Prince. I was trying to think there's probably a ribbon-cutting with his name on it. There's a queen somewhere some helin. Okay? Okay. No, that just sucks. Yeah, that's true. Let's see something else. He said was like if you choose not to walk with the Lord's chosen leaders that makes me want to throw up and like pick my throw-up up and throw it at people. It's that Affair. It is very graphic.  I know that offensive to you. It is offensive to me because it's like anything that you can't really pin on someone it's kind of the same thing as micro aggressions where it's like you're not really doing something wrong. So it's like the Lord's chosen leaders. That's what he said. Okay, as members of the Mormon Church, you are expected to receive your own confirmation that those are the Lord's chosen leaders. Well if I was still a member in the church, and I tried to receive that  Information for myself and I didn't receive that confirmation their explanation is just that I'm wrong exactly. That's the same thing that my Bishop told Brent and I when we were saying we have not received any confirmation that the prophet actually speaks for God in the bishop said well, then you need to keep praying to God that he will change your heart right? There is no choice. There's no you can't pin anything on anybody you just it's the same. I mean we've had this conversation a thousand times right where it's like you're praying for some miracle or you need a fridge and  You need that friend to really bring you that fridge that they just happened to have. Yeah, and if their garage yeah, and if they do then it's an answer to your prayer and if they don't it just wasn't God's well that yeah, there's an urgent that you needed. You really can't know they have an argument for everything. I mean, I think this is true of all Christian religions. If you start to not believe stuff, they'll just say well you just don't have enough Faith or you I mean a big thing in the Mormon church is that  Satan has a hold of you. Like that's that is why they have such a strict policy on reading quote unquote anti-mormon literature because or swimming on the Sabbath. Did you forget that Satan runs the wall, I never forget that on Sundays for missionaries all the time. They can't swim. No why Satan is in the  and that's Argentina on his mission and never once went to the beach but only for missionaries only for missionaries, but for her the normies for the regular people not on missions Satan only in the water on Sunday Sunday Sunday Susan, you know, I'm starting to think it's all fake but a double and I could be called a construct. Is it just the kind? Is it a constant? I mean, I just seriously it blows the mind if anyone really daughter is Jesus he turns that shit into wine and he walks on it and on it.  He's magical you think maybe this is a bunch of made-up bullshit. I didn't used to think it was a bunch of made-up bullshit. That's you know, let's let's use that to sort of segue into and we'll do a film pot at the end. Okay, because I love where we're going with this about how you used to believe it did. Yeah, go ahead. But let's discuss it after the break you want to go. Goodbye. Mary is always down or Debbie Debbie Downer. Okay. Well Debbie cake and maybe I'm just trying to take care of some business. Alright.

So Diana here again is a guest for our spirituality series series. It's be what you always smell which and so I want to know kind of what you believe. You're very hardcore Mormon and what point Did you sort of transform? I'm just going to turn the turn the time over to use the Mormon thing Mary. Oh, I'm very thankful to be here today. And no sorry. I have to like I could just slip into that way be remiss if I  I don't think God for all my blessings. Okay, my topic today or as God we could go all day. So when the bishop called and asked if I would speak and she wanted to say no, but then the still Small Voice told me you know, what that it's the top appealing than a boy's. Yes. Definitely more of a family heard last week feel that feeling. Well, you're fucked if you don't feel that feeling while your body feel that feeling anymore.  Well, you're fucked. So I thought the feeling for a really long time. We're unsure exactly. Did you the feeling it born and raised right? We're Race So born and raised born and raised in the church. Not in Utah. So whatever that means I do think that there is a there's a lot of cultural differences youngest of seven kids had the fully all in parents. Mom Relief Society president yada yada yada yada the whole the whole bit right so I then went on to get married.  And in the temple at the ripe old age of 19 years old Diana I did then you fucking creep. Oh, he knows he'll he apologizes regularly being a creeper. No one thought it was weird that the weirdest thing anybody thought was why is he 26 and not married yet? Like that was as weird as that guy but nobody thought it was weird. The 26 year old was Mary a nineteen-year-old know and maybe it's not even that weird. It's not and I don't know. I don't know seven years apart who can who can say  Which is the Constable it is we're eight years. I know but wait one of 19 in one is 20 something is different than you being like. It's one of those things where the older you get. Sure the more it seems silly. Yeah, the age the fact the matter is no 19 year old girl born and raised in a cult should be getting married because 19 year old girl anywhere re period anyway, right should but I'm getting new is being raised in the court has even less World Experience right last ability to make choices you have told this is what you're going to need to do and I'm the luckiest human being  And on the face of the planet that I married him and that things have gone the way they've gone but we so I mean we just continued to do the thing. I went to the temple every single month. We had three children cut to me being completely miserable and looking around and going this was supposed to be the purpose of my life. And this is supposed to be where Joy is this. Like was that your this was that your first English? I'm not happy how or was there some sort of doctoral issue know for me. It was that  I am miserable and I've been told my entire life that this is supposed to be what I'm supposed to do and I have I have a lot of sisters they have lots of children. I had lots of friends with lots of children and by no means did I think it was just going to be the easiest and most delightful thing, but I just there was something it was misery down some might call it depression. It was just like this is terrible and I'm just supposed to keep plugging along and keep having more children. By the way, the by the way, this is your eternal life right? Not just until you  You die, you're doing this shit forever in eternity. And so that was the first moment for me. And then there were lots of things that happened and our paths been a nice path sort of just sort of weaved in and out from each other and we talked a lot and we talked a lot about this on our pockets if anybody's interested in listening to more of like our specific story we go into detail about it, but eventually it was just okay. This isn't true. We don't believe any of this. This is not serving our family. We believe that we both have sustained a lot of damage from the way that we were raised in this we have three kids now, we don't want to  It's them in this like just totally we gotta get out of here and obviously nothing is easy. It took a long time to get yours is your family is all Mormon his family's all Mormon parents. Yes. Yes. Most of his siblings have left the church. None of my siblings have left the church. So I'm just gonna be hard being the youngest who they probably think you're just a dumb little kid anyway, and then you've left the church. I don't know whether you go to write. I don't know whether they feel that way or not. I haven't actually had a lot of conversations them, but I feel that way but I've I have always felt that  Yeah, my whole life like just being the youngest of a big family. There's a big age Gap. So I've always had like inferiority about that kind of stuff at that kind of stuff. But as we as we left, you know, like you're talking about the spirituality series like okay, then you start to look around and think okay. Where are we going? Yeah to go we go. We are going to ask the question that Elder Ballard so now because it doesn't leave with the Lord's chosen leaders and you're no longer waiting for things to  Resolve and for new insight to know I'm looking for the Insight that I can provide to myself wait you you mean you could use me for your own life. I can do that and you know what my answers they're not wrong there. You think I've been told my whole life that I can find my own answers, but only certain answers would be bright. You can only find the answers that we approve of the we approve up and that was one of the one of my issues more than more than Benz. I think was the credit the good credit of anything that ever happened was God.  God and if it was if anything was happening bad or needed to be fixed it was on me. So I just was feeling like where's my pat on the back? Where's my you did a good job, like where do I get credit for making the right choices or for doing the right thing? And you're right. I think the only thing you get credit for as a Mormon is being obedient right meaning following other people's choices for you and everything else is you're fucking up. Yeah. Yeah, well enough you do all the stuff you get a lot of credit for  Yes serving a lot of yeah, but it's you being obedient to what people above you tell you need to do, right? And where do these callings come from from the Lord? That's what they tell you from a dartboard. Yeah, we need someone to lead the music wait who has the most children and whose husband is working two jobs and getting a master's degree. Let's call her to be the primary president because then she'll think that this is like this is some great way for her family to receive blessings. Yeah, when really all it is is a recipe for her to have a complete and utter mental breakdown.  Um, basically like that's what I mean. The Tale As Old As Time like if these things happening, but yeah, I just wanted to have to get credit for my own stuff. Good and bad. Did you backing up a little bit? Sorry. Did you when you received callings in them or did you feel like it made you stand out, you know look better because I remember I would always call my Dad and tell him when I got new Collins. I needed him to approve I got news family. I guess what I just got called to be the second counselor in blabbetty blabbetty.  Yeah, because Nancy wood because I knew that yappy that was it. Yeah, that was how he was going to show love and approval and validation to you for sure. Right at least for a minute ready for like just a split the I mean depending on my calm angry about being called to the nursery. It was like if I was in some sort of leadership position no, no no in the nursery. They say very apologetically like oh you're an active and they just really need you to come to church. Yeah, that's basically  babysitting some smelly ass tiny room. I'm sorry. You can't convince me that God called any of Buddy to do any of these stupid things. Well, he didn't yeah he/she, whatever they say is calling what we can call him God in faith. We can call God him when we refer to Mormon God because Marvin sure sure dude. She man a white and he wears a dumb suit weld energy robe still. Why is he he's white skin it's going to run time under the robe a hundred percent and they're supposed to be sexy. I'm not sure.  You've caught onto this latest Trend but I heard that this week. I'm supposed to be sexy. Can I ask Diana a question, please? You said it took you three years to leave the church about? Yeah, okay, because we have a lot of listeners that are probably in there somewhere like are thinking they want to leave their entire extended family and friends and Community are still involved in this gang. So tell us about that process. So I went from all three hours every single week the first time that we started deconstructing or even questioning.  At all because like I said, we were as in and as committed as it gets I Was A Relief Society teacher I think and been for sure was in the elders Quorum president see because that's when we found out that Elders Quorum president. These are filled with men who don't believe in the church. So so anyone who might possibly be listening to goes to church take a look around to hear all different presidency is and be like and your size the other what present Elders quorum quorum. Okay. Thank you.  So that we were serving we were going every every week for all three hours kids going to primary yada yada yada from the from the first doubt that I no doubt doubted those doubts just start with so when we left was three years and the process went a little bit something like we would go and then next month. Maybe we went to three full three weeks and then  the fourth week we only went for an hour. Oh roubles. Yeah, just separate skip sacrament meeting and just come for the next two hours or then maybe six months later. We would skip an entire Sun like we wouldn't go to church at all or thinking about that. Were you trying to find a reason to stay or Reason To Leave or were you just sort of not knowing what to do? I think I just did not know what to do. Yeah, because that inevitably I would go and I would hear something extremely offensive or very difficult to hear and then I which I couldn't go  Next week. I just couldn't do it and heavy listening and like listening to podcasts and hearing that other people are going through this which was which is you know, that's why you have this podcast right? Like hearing other people's stories and hearing that you're not alone is huge. So that was a huge part of it just voraciously reading everything I could find where it started and it where when we met officially at the frozen yogurt place. Where were you in your path or Journey our journey as I so that was about a year before I was about six months before you left your up.  Like as far as physically who walked out of the building last year about six months before me, right, right. So yeah, I probably had about a year of trying to make it work and that last year I spent teaching primary and the last straw for me was I was teaching job and I admittedly know nothing about the Bible because I was raised Mormon. So kind of the Bible it's not didn't you talk about on your podcast or maybe it was one of the letters the emails that I read that someone said that they felt guilty when they studied the  I need to go back to the Book of Mormon. Yeah, remember that anyway, so I was I was teaching job and there was a boy in the class that said, you know, what's great about this is that this all literally happened literally God and I walked out and I walked hjb and damn said I have to be released and I started crying and she was like is everything. Okay, and I was like everything's gonna be fine, but I cannot do this anymore, and it was probably about six months later that I was sitting in a sacrament meeting and I heard two talks back to  Back about the Holy Ghost specifically now he helps you make the right decisions and there was like some sort of pity involved as far as other people not having the Holy Ghost and so they they don't have this help in making the right decisions and I was like, yeah. Yeah and this is where we immediately are teaching these kids from birth that they are better than other people and they have access to something that other people don't have access to her. I could not teach my kids that and right never went back Nietzsche's. Yeah, so  This comment was on other religions potentially that don't know about the Holy Ghost or I mean like I think it was the heathens. Yeah. It was just like I'm so glad that my son is so blessed. Yeah. My family has we have the Holy Ghost we have to help and like and that other people I can review said other people but it was just it was definitely like this. Yeah, we have this thing that other people don't offer special. We're still love ya and ya, I for 30 plus years just ate up being special. There's nothing.  I love more than being special. We think you're special. Thank you. Yeah, I loved it. It was a defining characteristic. It was like I was one of those people that was like the first thing that I said, but one that when people ask about me, so when your shelf broke and you finally had enough and you left was that the last time yeah, I was gonna did you suddenly feel not special anymore? Like how do you get that special feeling now? Who that's a great question. Thank you. You're good interviewer, baby.  I am super into like self-development and into therapy and into all the things that people who have had traumatic like all the Mormons should be into actual. I'll people I'm one of the I am someone that says that I think everybody should you it looks different for lots of different people and like anything were not just one way or the other but for me that has been how I it all comes from within right sounds so cheesy and will be defeated.  Oh, yeah, because and I'm sorry to interrupt but don't you think that the Mormon religion in particular teaches you that you are not special outside of this church. Oh, yeah. I see what you're so you have to have this your children internal stuff that would make you special outside of this religion actually doesn't exist. You're only special because of this religion. Yeah, I think so and I just like with anything your your confidence.  Your security your mental health and wellness. It all has to it's not something that anyone else can give to you. You have to find it in yourself. And so I had to figure out how to do that how to be you had to figure out who you were outside the church. Yes like it because I didn't know who I was at all and I would say on the one hand. I feel like you can't know who you are and we're all changing at such a rapid Pace that it's just going to be a constantly moving.  And process anyway, you might say you're trying to figure out your life. Maybe catch a straight girl have engaged really fully in that kind of stuff in self-healing in of caution. Yes, I can. So where did you because you believe Mormonism you believe God Jesus the whole thing. Yes, when you left the church officially. Were you still hanging onto a God Jesus thing. It was that done because at this point you are  It is so when did that break down for me? It's literally all part of deconstruction. So I read a lot of mystical stuff. I read a lot of Ram Dass Richard. Rohr try to think of other names that other people might be familiar with Harry Potter. Yes, this is Joseph. Like my worst. Enemy Joseph Campbell Alan Watts. Like this is the sort of mystical stuff that I find comfort and I am a I guess I would say Comfort but Jeff you had awesome.  I'm up the theology for lack of a better word of what you're reading. So there is an undeniable connection that we all have. I think it's very small minded to say that there is nothing tying anyone together and that there's nothing that is making the world and people cohesive there is clearly something that is pushing and pulling and it's in and out and there is the Zeitgeist is is real there's that's why Trends are Trends. That's why things get popular in certain places like there is a connection that people  Have I don't call that God? I don't think that that's what God is I don't like to personify it. Anyway to me. It's just Humanity. It's just what it is. So Penn jillette is a very outspoken and well known for his atheistic beliefs and I heard him say on a podcast ones that agnosticism is knowledge. So is there a god atheism is more the question of do you believe in God and I can't answer if there is one or not, but I don't believe in one eye.  I think that there is a connection there is something and I don't understand the need to Define it right and to not just surrender to it were humans. There's no such thing as other people's children. So let's treat each other all like we're doing this together because we fucking are yeah. Yeah ever this is on it. Yeah. So for me the deconstruction, I think there probably was a time that I was still in on God and Jesus because that's a natural progression. It would be very hard to go all like completely all-in-one lagoa one.  Yeah, and I attended it and I am familiar with lots of people that still do hold on to that and I get that in lots of other people who still use the words, but if you were to talk to them at what about what they mean by that it's not going to be like a literal God and Jesus thing. It's very mystical. It's very like I'll just use these words because you're comfortable with them as you were letting go because I know his Mormons you're raised to feel  aided by this by this how lucky we are the wave of the knowledge that God has a body and the blah blah like Mormons are lucky because Mormons know who God is right? Yeah, they want to have to calculate. Yeah. So as you're letting go of that was there any sadness with letting go there was sadness at every step of the way, I think because everything holds so much weight, right? So as you move through that because I know there's we have a lot of listeners who were beginning the journey who are in the middle of it who are afraid to start it. Well you are grieving that's you look it is fully a grief.  Sounds totally normal lots of he's saying yeah, and I that's what that's the one suggestion I would have is to just stop trying to make it be anything that it isn't stopped. Try to fix the feelings or make them go away sit in those few got to sit in it and it's shitty, but you have to sit you have to sit in it. And so yeah if there was every step I mean because there's there's the community aspect right and there's the loss of relationship or change of relationship with members of my family. There's definitely losses of friendship that I've had to deal with and then yeah feeling like I could  could pray and have access to this person that was hearing me and going to help me and I'm feeling like I need your car keys. Now. I arrived still can't answer. I haven't driven in like four years because I cannot find my fucking it's like I'm an ex-mormon Hoover user. This is the interesting thing. This is like a little bit of a tangent but like as a more mature camera shy  I'm and I'm familiar with how we do things other students just like I guess being about this now. Okay, because we do believe that they were all separate beings Jesus. Like I was I didn't really care about Jesus. Yeah. No, you're right. I didn't understand the atonement. So I will say this I was as all in as it gets and is all in as it gets you can still totally not understand Jesus. Oh my God, I remember having arguments with Brent as we were leaving and he still very Christian.  And I would ask him over and over explain to me the atonement. Oh my God, no one could ever calling. I just like no one ever explained to me the priesthood like no, it doesn't make sense dragon and I would tell him if someone can word these things in a way that I understand. I will stay yeah can't do it interesting. I will I for sure towards the end of my journey and with any sort of like official religiosity. I was only using it as like gratitude and comfort because I've never understood an interventionist God at all. So this is another way where it's like I just the cognitive dissonance was  Last like I was doing this home warm and thing and saying and believing all of these things and on the other side. I was like, I don't get the atonement. I don't think God intervenes and it's like they can't both coexist. Yeah, and they didn't obviously but I couldn't understand like if I pray and I ask for things like why is he going to Hollywood? How are you and I'll never get this kind of leukemia next door, right? I didn't don't for me. It was just like comfort and gratitude. Like that's all I used prayer for kind of not surprised that Mormons cling to this heavenly father idea more than Jesus because  Jesus was like a hippie wearing sandals in a row behind out with prostitutes and lepers and tax collectors or whoever the hell more we're going to talk about that they talk about they will be like, oh hi and a throne. He's probably wearing a suit. You're not a man. He's coming back to Missouri has she was face Heavenly father's not going to set foot in Missouri. Let's be real people know he's gonna send Jesus. Well, I'm home. Just hover above anyway, like he's not gonna be on the ground with like the comments below.  Worthy to be in his generals. Yeah, and it didn't take anything away from my actual like my actual life. None of its tangible. Anyway, it's true. It's all different beliefs. How were you and this is a question and an issue that a lot of our listeners have how are you able to find a new community? Because you cannot honestly leave the church being ex-mormon and stay buddies with a Mormon group. It just does it work? I don't I don't know of anyone who has managed to do that. I don't either and I will say about that and how did you find a new group so  So it's hard and it's ongoing and that's the other thing that I will be very clear about is that it is difficult and we live in a really fantastic neighborhood and we're just like in the very heart of Suburbia, right? So we just tried to do the best that we can to be invested. Now, here's an interesting thing that you don't ever think about or talk about when you are going probably to any church because this is I will be clear this is something I have learned in all of the educating that I've done for myself in the last like five years is that Mormonism?  I'm is in different than other Christian religions than other religions period in a lot of ways the way they do community in the way they make you feel like you'll have no one and then you leave and you really do have no one that's not uncommon. Yeah, and it's not specific to Mormonism at all. So you're not allowed to be introverted or extroverted in the church. No one's allowed to have like a personal identity and have like different you can have different strengths and weaknesses. She could have different but when you're expected to be this president or this counselor this whatever your  personal identity goes out the window and you have to be a certain way. It's just you have to what do you think once you get to the top of the chain and you were speaking in general conference? Suddenly, you sound like every other fucker got ever load engine. Absolutely. And why do you think that it's all in the societal terms successful white men that are all at the top because these are the guys that perform well in a certain way they so they just didn't they fit them all and they just climbed the ladder. Well you have me I'm very extroverted. I didn't have difficulty.  Making friends inside or outside of the church, but my husband is totally introverted. This is an uncomfortable position for him to be in when he was first comes when the elders Quorum president. See he tried to speak as little as humanly possible. He's like, I don't have any interest in standing up in front of a group of dudes and teaching them. I don't want to do that. Yeah, and it was viewed as like this is a this is just something that doesn't come natural to you that you need to fight through and you'll be blessed and and blah blah blah like you grow to help you grow magnify your calling. How about  There's nothing wrong with being an introvert. Yeah. Stop trying to make me like you. Yeah, I'm not like you and that's okay. I have my own strengths from being this way. So it's difficult outside of the church to try to make friends when you're in that situation, but you just I don't know you say random things to random people and see if they bite and if they bite their your friends is the interesting interesting that ex-mormons that that's a thing. How do I make friends? Yes. That's all I heard. I think the normal population of people know how to make  Friends, I think you're wrong. I think adults are still are full of shit. Nobody knows nobody. That's something nobody knows nobody has any idea what he's my friend The Stranger in line with me at the shopping because you're the most extroverted person that's existed on this planet and that's okay too. I'll just full of shit and we're all just doing the best that we can't always struggling to feel included. Yes the time all the time. So maybe if you're an introvert or just a normal human being not as extroverted as myself maybe.  Be realizing that pretty much 99% of the people out there feel just like you. Yeah that so that it's okay. It's okay to put forth an effort to just to say hi to someone because that person is probably afraid to do it as well and Mormons don't teach you this but people are actually good people that takes off majority of people are good kind people that will talk to you if you talk to them. Yeah, just well and there's something called meet up meet up.com if you want to find an ex-mormon crowd. There's a meetups for everything. I mean, it's not  And yeah, there's never been a better time an easier more convenient time to be doing any of this stuff the that mean the internet for all its faults has lots of really amazing resources. And so it's a great connection to look like an I really do. So you just try do you remember when I don't remember it might have been it was probably the profit at the time in the general really society meeting challenge the sisters to take attend a break from filming me were well out of the church by they were well, I don't sue my disgusted but  But I know about it because of course if you took the 10th a break you had to announce that you were taking the 10 deity. And here's why I love is that this wasn't a challenge given to the men given to the wisdom because supposedly women are the one who waste their time on social media and I mean the whole thing's fucked up, but the fact that some man could tell millions of women you need to take attend a break and they did it. They announced that they were doing and then we came back on they were so telling him about the blessing of it was app and how about anybody fucking takes attend a break from so  And they're going to feel better. Yeah, I know. Yeah, it's good to unplug now and then unplug every once in a while. So questions. Give me the one best way that your life is different having been out of the church. And the worst way if there is a worse those are interesting are interesting questions. The best way is that I'm allowed to change my mind about anything at all ever all the time as many times as I want my God. I love that that there is just  No, like I and I did not know this about myself before but I super get off on freedom like that is so it's just it's Freedom maybe because you didn't have it for so long. I didn't have it and I didn't know that I didn't have it because I thought it would agency. Yeah exactly. I OB all the Commandments and that gives me Freedom. So being able to just have an actual tangible thought process behind my own.  If behind how I raised my kids because that was a big question that we got asked a lot was like well, how are you going to raise your kids without any morals? I had that it's well, I mean he's irritated now. I have to think about the fact that I've been telling them to kill people. So like I just I heard it one time as far as like morals with kids and it's like I'm an atheist. I don't believe in a higher in a personified higher power.  But the reason that I don't steal at the store is because if I steal at the store the Checker at the store might get in trouble like being like short on the drawer might like whatever it is, I do it because you care about people not because you're afraid of God's judgment. Yeah. I know remember I mentioned this I think last week two is my mother is similar in that she thinks that if you're not specifically in her case a Christian, then you don't have a moral compass like  What motivates you to do like quote the right thing because I don't care about other people. Yeah, because she chooses a care about people because she has a heart and I hope and I hope that that is extended towards me by the choice for sure. And I mean, there are definitely people that take advantage of others. We see this all the time. Yeah, for some reason they're not making that same just write that same Choice. What do you think is the worst are is there a worst?  I mean difficulties in relationships and friendships is definitely not fun. But that isn't to say that there weren't difficulties before it's just there's a different they have maybe a specific reason behind them. But so like strain on family relationship and my relationships, but I for me it has led to its just led to more healing like they just a little illuminates the things that I need to work through for my own self.  So I don't even know that I have a negative spin on that even maybe just things that are more difficult than yeah. She's but that just you know, what the worst part the worst part about leaving is that I truly deep down in my soul want everyone else to leave and everyone else isn't leaving for sure. This is one hang up that you have is your love. I really do. Are you a champion of everyone needs to fuck my gosh disagree with you?  People I know that are like I don't I mean you name it you've talked about them on the podcast and there's tons of people who are in these situations and I get it. Hmm But I just want everybody that we all raise your hand Lester's if you want your friends and loved one. We totally yeah fucking more miniature someone who wants to leave and can't figure out a way just know that I am here begging you to leave please observe you  It now. So what tell me then in your process of developing your own spirituality. Would you call yourself a spiritual person? I would not call myself a spiritual person but I don't believe I was ever a spiritual or that's right. Yeah, so I was a definitely like rule follower obedience was easy for me, but there wasn't a whole lot of like feeling the spirit. Yeah, and I had moments but by the way, they were all related to music and I've had just as many of those experiences unrelated to Mormonism. So now I get it I get it. I think just the whole I felt the spirit is not  something that Mormonism should be able to Clan that's what defines a spiritual person necessarily know. I'm I think it can be different like for so been my husband. He he classifies himself as a spiritual person and I just I'm not I don't I don't think that I am that's what um, and you know, it's probably comfortable for you since you think that you've never and not that you think you're that you have never in your opinion been a spiritual person and you're cool with that now it's like it's not there's nothing wrong with you. Whereas was you're a Mormon. You don't feel any kind of spiritual thing.  Wrong with me, right? Yes. No, it's fine for me. And I like I said, like I read lots of things from mystical people and people who are looking for more and wanting to talk about it and like the idea of what are we doing here? And who are we and why is this happening? I'm super interested in all of those kinds of questions. I just don't I don't know. There's just like there's a feeling that goes along with thinking about spirituality that I'm like, I'm not I'm comfortable not feeling like I have to have that got ya going back to your departure from the church. What is something that you  you wish you would have done differently on your way out and then laughing gave him all the middle. And then what advice would you give to people who are just kind of looking over the edge of that Cliff or they're about to flick the Domino. Like what would you say to them? And what would you have done differently? So I don't know that I would have done anything differently. I think that we because like anything hindsight you have hindsight now.  All but going through it the way that we did. I think we handled every situation pretty slowly and as well as we thought we could I didn't have any big they all took book and forever to get all the saying this to me. Meanwhile you and your husband or your kids for like the hell are you doing the only reason I'm here is because I'm like schlepping my kids to primary should be the last reason you go. It's just left your kids today are looking brain.  Washing room there was there was something recently there was something recently that that I thought. Oh, I could have done more of that. I think Ben feels like he wishes he would have spoken that more but that's just not really in his nature to do that. No, I don't know. I don't know that there's anything I would have done differently. There's no right way to do it. Exactly. There's no everyone's different and everyone has different interactions with their Ward members and everyone has different interactions with their family who they're going to hurt ya ever is just no right way to do it. So I think I wouldn't really change anything about that the  Face that I would give is to leave leave now, we are at the second now. Yeah, and if you're reaching out and finding people who are in similar situations because one of the one of the big things that I had a problem with and still struggle with is because I'm the only one in my family has left that that's really really hard for me. I suppose I feel very alone and I'm like can't wait for the day that I have like more people quote unquote on my side because it's just like this like, yes, okay you get  It like it. Yeah, it's just like being in the church where there's a language that only people who are Mormon understand there's a language when you leave the church that only ex-mormons understand. It's why you and I have been such good friends for so long because it's like this shared experience that no one can ever take away from us their true. So I just find people that will help you and I this here it is. Here's my actual advice in syrup. Leave it all in down all of it. Trust the people that say they love you.  And what I mean by that is if you have a mom or a dad or sister or a spouse who says that they love you and you feel like you cannot do this thing anymore. You can't go to this place. You can't say these things. You can't live this way, but you don't want to hurt those people. That's a lot of the situations that people are in right they just they're doing it because they don't want to hurt these other people you have to trust them that they will love you anyway, and if they do not love you anyway, that is something  Will then be confronted with and you will have decisions to make but you will know the truth. I can't love anything more on this Earth more than honesty that I live and breathe it. You have to be honest, if people tell you that they love you. You have to give them the chance to show you that they love you. And if they don't then you can find people that do because there are people that love you. There are people that will help you and there are people that will accept you you just you have to find them and you have to trust  Us them that is that is beautiful, but it's scary as sugar again me what you just said because this sums up my relationship with my mother right Joe and I don't live honestly in that regard because it's too difficult. It's so hard. Yeah so hard because my fear is that well actions speak louder than words, right? You can say you love so much are all day long. But how do you really show it? Sure and we have listeners in this  Nation where they might just be like if they if they're honest with their family their parents they might be like, well you're dead to me get out right that really can happen. Oh, yeah, it has happened. Yeah, that's scary. It's terrifying. Yes and to be able to like have the confidence to say I want to be authentic more than I want to please you. What is it that our Patron Kimberly a always says about is it a fire to warm everybody else? Yeah. I don't like yourself on.  Fire just to keep other people warm exactly love that expression that yes. It's a really good freshen. Yes, but it's difficult to put into practice. That's terrible takes a lot of practice. Yeah, it does it takes practice and it takes the support of other people and even like even if those are mental health professionals that you're paying to support you. There are people that work. It's still support. There will be people it opens. I'm not actually as optimistic of a person naturally as I think I might be sounding for people.  But if those people shut you out in whatever way they do there will then be a void and you have the opportunity to fill the void with people that will fill it better. And yeah, and we'll help you more potentially and those people that shut you out then they also have to deal with that. That's that's something that they will it then they could be major choices and get to make their faces a choice to make yeah. One thing I think about is if you are being someone different to get this love from people, is that really is that do they really love you or  They love this version of you some someone that's like this. Yay. Yeah, but we're actually not like that head. So you're kind of yeah being dishonest with that you're presenting an opportunity to love who you really are anyway, and it might hurt because they might decide not to yep. And that's a choice that they should be given totally people deserve the right to make the choices with the honest set of facts. I agree and I was presented with an on a set of facts and I and I made my choices and then I laid those facts out for other people and they made their yeah, and then don't you find that?  People who stay the people who truly you find out have your back those connections are just unbreakable. They are amazing. And you feel like okay. Here's my people. These are my people because this is me and I am one of them and they have one of me in this this is right, but nothing nothing feels better than being loved for who you really are and how you really treat people and being loved and accepted that way. There's just there's nothing like that connection. So absolutely there was a big moment I had when I was leaving the church and I had joined this new  Jim and no one knew me and so I could just be whoever I wanted. So I was swearing and being allowed and doing whatever and nobody cared. They thought I was funny. They thought I was great. They loved me for who I was being who was actually myself. Yeah. I've never had that opportunity with in Mormonism from you. You fit the mold and people loved you because you fit the mold had I gone to like play basketball with the guys and have been making like crude jokes or spanking something on the ass or like Mike I wouldn't do in real life like you do.  They wouldn't have accepted me. And and so there it just seems like with in Mormonism surely in other religions as well. But with in Mormonism, there's just a lot of fake relationships because absolutely of course, you don't know who you are firstly It Sports community. So that's true. It's a Band-Aid and everyone's trying to live up to some fake standard. Anyway. Yeah, so getting out there's so many bonuses, but I think when that you've covered for sure is you get to be yourself and you get to find your people and that can happen.  Anytime because some people are like I've been in it for so long and it's not like the matter. You will find a better Community where you fit in where they accept you and guess what this awesome you get to pick. Yeah, you get to pick your friends you get to pick your hobbies and you can leave if it doesn't work and you know to what you were saying look for those people who truly love you, we had a listener right in early on and we actually met her and Utah who ended up censoring her letter.  Amber she sent a verse first version of it and then it took us a couple days to get back to actually Shelley. Does this I don't get back to too many people. Sorry everybody. I'm busy making YouTube videos and stuff. But anyway her friend read her letter and and was judging her. She's like you sound like what is she even came in the scent that yes sound. So pathetic. Yeah. Why would you say that? Yeah. I know. I know like they don't but you really think that they are going to have the time to read your name correctly. That's what she was saying.  The friend was saying they're from kind of friend. Is that what kind of friend is that? And so she was like, oh, I'm so sorry. I wrote that she wrote us again. I was like, I'm so sorry. I always did your tutor. You need to read the read the letter that I already ran to my friend told me. That is not your friend. Yeah, that is not a friend to you. Right? Nope. You need to surround yourself with people who uplift you. Yes, and that's got to be challenging to recognize those people.  Well after you leave a cult, you know, most things are harder after he looks higher existence higher. Yeah, you have to figure out who really is for you because people will tell you some stuff that you want to believe but then when it comes right down to it, they are not on our side bang on believing people when people tell you they're an asshole believe them. Yeah people you do. They tell you they're assholes all the time and we're just like oh, but maybe they're not know your baby. Maybe they told you they were racist they told you they were homophobic you just  Pretend it's not hear it but they were telling you the whole time. What about people whose plane? They're not those things and then you see it later in there how that's what she's saying. Yeah, but they say that they're just like no. No they tell you in there. I told you yeah, it takes practice recognizing those actions. Yeah that really speak very loudly other people. Yeah, we've covered a lot here is awesome. Our head engineer of organization like every Sunday almost  I'm a podcaster. That's almost like you know how to speak. Yeah comes naturally a reminder her podcast if she does with her husband is awesome. It's called your friends and they chat and you will love to meet Ben Ben actually has you do as well.

Episode 77 of equalizer podcast Daniel auletta and Chelsea Bush are back in the hot seat as the nwsl picture begins to crystallize the North Carolina courage are suddenly but maybe not surprisingly on a role and that role has gotten them some historic results and a third consecutive nwsl Shield red stars are back in good form and they are into the playoffs. The Thorns are not  Great form, but they did beat the - on Saturday night and that got them into the playoffs. Even if neither the Thorns nor the league knew it until Sunday morning Royals and Rain playing a little hot potato with the fourth spot and the spirit are the only team that have a miracle chance to put both the Royals and rain out the - now officially eliminated sky blue FC and the pride have been for some time. So Chelsea all four games on Saturday night, which is  Ever ideal to you know, kind of consume all of them, but it seems like we had this weird season where things were a little bit muddled and you wake up Sunday morning. And the three teams we all thought were the best from the start of the season are the three teams that are right back in the playoffs again.  Yeah, there was a while and I think at the beginning of the Season that you know, Washington looked pretty good Utah looked pretty good. You start to say okay, maybe things are going to be different this year. Maybe it's and to be fair. It was not a total, you know run away like it was last year where it was just painfully obvious from the start how things were going to play out and it does obviously the rules in the rain or kind of kind of come down to the wire. But I mean you have the shield winners repeating for three years.  In a row, you have the thorns and Chicago making the playoffs for what five years in a row now. Yeah beef is for for the Thorns five for the red stars. Yeah, North Carolina making the playoffs. If you go back to their their Western New York. What for now? Yep, so it's getting and then the other ones he's either going to be the rain who have been there before for the Royals who are new but also kind of have that F CK C pedigree, so  It's a little I don't want to say disappointing because obviously you want to see good teams rewarded and it's especially in in some cases like Chicago like North Carolina where you see where there's a lot of their core players were players that they drafted and they built up this Core built around it over time. It wasn't just they went out and acquired a bunch of superstars. It kind of created these teams. It's good to see that rewarded but I'm going to be honest with it and I think I'm a little bit as I am a little bit this point I guess is the word  word just that it's once again kind of the same and we were potential to have the same two teams in the final that we've had for the last two years. Now. That's a little gets a little old to be honest. I look at this. I'm not disappointed by the courage because I am just blown away by what the courage have built and how the courage have sustained it. I don't know why but I'm a little bit less excited about the Thorns continuing to build on what they've done now for the last  As for basically since Mark Parsons got there and they redid their roster or quite a bit ahead of that 2016 season. I don't mind it as much as you do because I don't mind the Excellence coming through. I think what I mine though is not you know, looking at these games and looking at the season. I think it was a very quiet offseason. Remember not a lot happened in the offseason. They expanded rosters, which I think contributed and teams just didn't seem really to want to make moves which surprised me.  Based on how far some of the team's Downstream had to go to catch up to the courage and the thorns and to a lesser extent the red star so I don't like watching things that seem inevitable but I don't mind watching the courage and to a lesser extent the Thorns just like build these programs and this is something we did for saw, you know, the League's because if they were starting the League's would kind of expire and I think that the I think the fact that the courage haven't had a great season.  Just kind of flipped a switch about two or three weeks ago is pretty remarkable for a team that you could you would not blame them. Maybe if motivation was not a hundred percent for them this season after what they did last season and so many other players winning the World Cup, etc. Etc. Yeah. Marijuana, I don't want to be like I'm mad. Like I'm annoyed that these teams won. Like you said excellent should be rewarded and they've put in the work. It's just, you know, it takes some of the excitement away from me. I do find it interesting though because I think  Think that the courage and the Thorns are both not as good as they were left here agree. I was afraid of Clint. I think only Chicago is better and yet, you know Chicago's in a higher position right now and could potentially host a playoff game out think they've done that since 2015, but it's still kinda it's a kind of a, you know, you kind of impressive and kind of again disappointed because you want to see those other teams make the improvements and make the league more exciting. I mean the most Movement we saw was  Sky blue and those four players requesting trades and and they've done some things. I think they're kind of slowed that tide and then change their narrative a little bit but  as you know, I don't look at many teams besides Chicago and the Royals and say yeah, they really put in the work and there are a lot better than they were last year Well, I even made a lot of moves. They just took what they had built on it. Yeah and the spirit mostly built through the draft but you know, they're moving in the right direction. I'll disagree slightly about sky blue though. The narrative has changed a little bit in terms of they're getting more people. They have a more likeable general manager both publicly and  And seemingly behind the scenes they're going to have their second game at Red Bull Arena, but it remains to be seen whether or not that translates into players actually wanting to be there. They still had an interim coach and replace them with another interim coach when they said they were getting ready to hire a full-time coach and they just said they still need a venue for next season and don't have one and next season's not too terribly far away at this point. What were you going to add there? I can stay on top of all that there's still not a very good team. I mean I can't  Can't can't believe they won last night to be honest. I thought they were getting outplayed.  Yeah, I mean it seems like and I think that's actually been an issue for the rain. This season is out playing teams are not getting results. But yeah, they very much got one ball into Carli Lloyd she took advantage of it and  while I want nothing and I thought the rain I thought the rain really needed to win that game. I thought that was a no excuse game for them. Oh, yeah. I think they're gonna look back on this season. I think when they don't make the playoffs that's going to be the game they point to and yeah, they drop points elsewhere, but that's the one where they had all the pieces. They had Megan Rapinoe back for 45 minutes. Obviously, she's still has a lot to go to get to get match fit. But as much as they've had in drinking a point this out any other that is a game. They should have one and you have to do that to make the playoffs.  And some succeed in the playoffs has it and the Royals are doing the same thing because either one of those teams could have had the other one buried by now, but just to finish up on Sky Blu, they had mace Haley Maze and Julia Ashley were both first-round picks. That didn't come. Well Julie Ashley is currently in the United States and her contractor overseas ended and she's not playing for anybody. So if she wanted to play for sky blue FC you would think they would have already contacted the team coming to an agreement and she'd be playing.  NG instead her rights expire with them at the end of the season and she becomes a discovery player. So you have to assume based on all those facts that she's waiting it out and intends to go and play somewhere else. So in order for them to flip the narrative they're going to have to actually create a culture where players are going to want to be in a not going to wind up creating a high first-round pick for Caprice tied Desco a backup keeper and Estelle Johnson, right Johnson, very good. The gas goes okay back up go.  You bring you can get anywhere. That's a bad term it as a bad trade as they were forced into it.  Yeah, I know you look at plate teams. Not just a bit look at all and or even Houston to an extent, these lower rankings a lot of it is because they shoot themselves in the foot. They get themselves into positions or players want out or they're desperate to find something that they think can work. Now they try to weigh their draft picks, they lose good players because the players don't want to stay. I mean Sky Blues had good players. They have been mccaskill who I think has is an immense ceiling never could get the best out of her had to let her go. She's now doing better as I would say it Chicago and then huh  I think as a bright future ahead of her. So and then they pay for these mistakes for his years and years and years.  Well, the pride particular particular they came into the league and everyone said why are you coming in in an olympic year when you're going to lose some of your big-time players why not come in after the Olympics, but they want it in and they essentially sold their soul to get Alex Morgan on the team. Not a terrible idea. She's a terrific player when healthy she's a terrific marketing agent when she's there which is and she has been that for them, but they are still chasing.  The draft picks they gave away and they're still chasing some of the assets that they gave away to the point where this offseason they brought in a new coach and GM and they had next to zero roster flexibility and they may be looking at something similar again adding into this offseason. They do at least do have I believe they have their draft picks are in order at least they might have the highest pick they've ever made but they basically sold their soul for Morgan. They got Marta didn't work didn't get over the top and now they are you know, they have  Morgan and Marta and they're terrible and they've got to figure out how to rectify that and I'm not sure what the answer is.  No, I don't either but then you have to factor in also to seller Kevin mean look at the project got a lot of players who are probably playing making pretty good money. A lot of international players who have Ali Krieger who's not allocated but surely has to be making a high salary. You have surely the veteran Max whatever that is. Yeah, you have something like a lot of kid and he's probably making pretty good. You've got Marta has to be at the max. I mean that gives them so little flexibility and and I think that this guitar, you know, you look at em, so I think that was a great pick.  For them and so he's obviously has the ability to identify and attract some good players, but there's only so much he can do there and I don't know how yeah, I agree. I don't know how you dig yourself out of these holes. It just seems like a again they want something now. They trade away things for the future. It doesn't work out. You can't just go and pick out one or two players and all of a sudden turn losing sit season into a playoff one. They're just not in this league. It doesn't work like that. Now we'll put the rain in Royals kind of  together because they are they have about the same chance of making it to the playoffs but of the other teams and I'll even give the rain all the injury. I think if the rain were healthy particularly a fish lock was there they be that fourth playoff team, but of the other five teams or four teams, I guess who is the most disappointing to me? It's easily Euston Oh by far. I mean you and I both agreed before the season that they should have picked up a lot of points during the World Cup, right? They had players like we're to who should have  Don't want to say breakout season sort of a return to really I mean they have they have so many talented players. It baffles me that again. I'm I've been pretty clear on this and past podcasts and I'm always willing to give a coach more than just one season to turn a roster around but the fact that you have players like daily and Ohio who can't seem to find the back of the net to save their lives when they've done that in the past that's concerning their defensive issues. They've always been there and they weren't going to change but the  fact that they still can't seem to finish, you know, they had chances last night CeCe Kizer had several good chances at the end of the game. They should have tied that game. They weren't the better team but they had enough chances good chances that they should have gotten one pass a very good goalkeeper and just in general they played by 2021 games whatever it is, you've got daily who are two and oh, hi. They should accidentally come up with a four goal game at some point between them like they should just by pure.  Just the fact that they're out there should just tear apart a game at some point and it just it hasn't happened. And we saw that last season. I mean they tore apart again sky-blue in Washington were terrible at here, but he wasn't wasn't that different than they were last year minute Personnel was a lot of it was the same and they did have some of those games that they just blew them out of the water.  Yeah, I want to talk a little bit about their Tuesday game in North Carolina, tactically, but when I get into that it'll open up different can of worms is so let's step aside for a moment and we'll come back and get into Z Tuesday night. And if we want to call it a fiasco but not the best not the best midweek for nwsl was but at that way with Chelsea, I'm Dan. This is The Equalizer podcast.   Back on The Equalizer podcast, this is episode 77. I'm Dan Le letter. I've got Chelsea bush with me and a friendly reminder to please rate and review The Equalizer podcast the better ratings and reviews that you give us the more great content we can bring to you. So please rate and review The Equalizer podcast today Chelsea. We finished up the last segment talking about the - and I thought their Tuesday night game and yes, they did play Tuesday.  In North Carolina was one of the more interesting tactical matches. We've seen this season because and I did speak to James Clarkson on Monday. So maybe that led me to watch it a little bit differently, but I thought that it was a rare occasion where a coach went into a game said, you know what we're not as good as this team on, you know even footing and we're going to play like we're not as good as them and we're going to try to steal a result and they darn near did it and  There's a little bit more to it than that, but just on the let's start with it just to Tactical front. I really enjoyed watching that. I think that maybe was an example of how the first year coach has grown into the role a little bit since the start of the Season. Yeah. I thought they played very very well defensively and to a similar extent last night against the Thorns. They were very compact to got numbers behind the ball. They did a really good job of not letting their backline get stretched too much. I mean it's north.  I know they're going to get him behind but I think there's limited those chances and I think they got a little bit of luck. This evening is one of those games for North Carolina just wasn't finishing and we all know that happens. Jen Campbell makes them very good saves. But yeah, they executed it. I thought very very well and it took something they didn't really do as much last night against the Thorns if they did that fought better against North Carolina was you know, execute on the counter they didn't finish any of those as we talked about that in the last session, but they were creating the opportunities when they got them and taking advantage of that and  playing very quickly against a team who's known for also being very quick. So yeah, I thought they did excellently as far as that goes and we can't hide from the fact that in a league where there are often complaints about the referees that this was one of the worst refereed games I've ever seen the penalty call that created the goal was horrendous not ticky-tack not I can see how  You would have thought that was a penalty watching it in real time. It was a horrendous call. There also should have been a call against Hinkle there was a boot to the face. It should have been a card. There was all kinds of stuff. It was awful.  Yeah, probably the worst officiated women's soccer game. I've seen nwsl since the 2017 final and I would agree. Maybe maybe we're in some ways maybe worse, but let's not go to the comparison thing. Yeah, because and it's also about consistency some officiants call it officials call it, you know more strict than others. And as long as they set kind of a tone early on you see what they're going to do. I can live with that this one I mean you would  Probably two yellow cards missing the first half I would say Krishna Hamilton that boot to the face obviously should have been I think it's Amazon, right? I think so. Yeah should have been yellow card. I think so fisherman probably should have gotten yellow card the first half for persistent infringement. And then you look at the the non penalty against England in the penalty called against newest and Not only was that penalty called against me as I mean, there was minimal contact. I'm not going to go out and say a player does but there was minimal contact. It was not even a foul just  Two players touching each other things these things happen. I don't think you can call every single little bit of contact a foul and saw her you're not going to have any sort of a game. But you look at that in light of the contact that there was between kuerten Hinkle in North Carolina's box. If that's not called. That's your if that's your Baseline. How do you even make the argument that the other one is called? I that's what I don't understand if you want to call both, that would be one thing but to call the lighter the much obviously lighter one and not the other one. It just baffles me, but didn't  Done and didn't done initiate the contact like she kind of just fell into Muir's like newest wasn't even facing Crystal done. Yeah, but I mean, I think she went down again to players bodies touching sometimes things the coolest lose their balance they fall over. I don't think there was any any sort of a foul made on Chrissy meiosis part. I'm also for the most part I am more okay with missing a penalty than I am with calling a penalty. That shouldn't be a benefit.  That's I mean like Hinkle call. I don't know who she took it was a daily that she took down I think what we're after. Yeah. Well, I swear to you right? I mean that's a that's a that was an obvious penalty, but I would rather if you're not sure don't call the penalty then if you're not sure on the other side call the penalty. There's still both bad calls. Yeah, but I just I prefer some consistency you at least give both teams more even playing field and it was just I say, I don't know if something was said that  The referee at halftime because I think it came out and really started calling things a lot differently and they you can't again you can't you have to be consistent. You can't set the tone in the first half and let players get away with some things, you know, give them a speaking to you. Don't you? Don't say you don't say hey, this is you've done the suit that two times three more three more you're getting a card and just all of a sudden start calling it like they're not how are they supposed to know how to play the game and I don't think you should you should play to see what you can get away with I don't I guess approve of that. But at the same time you have to know  Know what's going to happen when you're going into the game and I think he was he was wildly all over the place. Right? And I've long said that if you're going to fix the referee problem and there is a referee problem, then the players and coaches need to be part of the solution. You can't try to get away with everything and then blame the referees when you fool them or when your opponent Falls them. Yeah, and then we, you know people like to say that there's no diving in women's soccer or not nearly as much as men soccer a lot more than there was a year or two.  Or exactly there's a lot more than and so it's starting to be a little they're just playing to the you know, trying to get that lift on it takes so much of the beauty out of what's supposed to be the beautiful game so much I agree and if you got and if you want to talk about consistency, and another one of the worst referee games ever that 2012 Olympic semifinal when they called McLeod for holding the ball too low like yeah, like that's just on a like if you call that fine call it but don't just pull it out and in the Olympic semifinal that's yes.  That's never called. Yeah that and you know and in the car is - game we got the guys calling, you know eater whole the foul throw in which again, you know, I'm not saying that you shouldn't have to throw the ball incorrectly. But you're missing cards and penalty calls and you're calling foul throws and in stoppage time. He's backing players up on throw-ins in the defensive half of the field it that I just the gain hog and left me quite dissatisfied with having invested my 90 minutes.  I will say that I was told that this was I think his second and there we are sell game. Yes, that's correct. Maybe needs a little bit more practice. I would say certainly not ready for what's a tier-one professional game. That's just unfair to the players. I would also say that while yes, there is a you know part of the problem is that the nwsl is a stepping stone. They don't get paid as much as MLS officials. So guess what the officials are going?  You want to be in MLS for they make more money and have a longer season.  But there's no level of any sport where there's not a perceived officiating problem. I mean one of the biggest storylines of the weekend last weekend was a botched call in an NFL game which was a rematch of a playoff game which had maybe the worst call in the history of any pro sports officiating so it's don't you know, don't make it seem like you spend a few more dollars and the referees get infinitely better to the point where they don't make these kinds of mistakes. Yes. There's an issue with  I don't know. What word I'm looking for. We guess there's an issue where you want to make it you want to make someone say hey, I'm in the nwsl making good money. This is where I want to be but it's not quite that simple.   Meanwhile, meanwhile in that game Rachel's well as I honestly Rachel daily out of it, but Mara Messiahs tore her ACL in that game, so she's out for the season. She wasn't happy about it. But after Rachel daily on Twitter, I get it. She was not she was frustrated, you know our seasons over probably a good portion of next season is is also off the table for her. How about the fact that it looks now like Heather O'Reilly who it looked like she was going  Be starting her last game when they gave her that ceremonial start and the auditor Heather O'Reilly is now going to exit her pro career probably as the starting right back on the favorites to win the nwsl championship. How Wild is that?  It is wild and I think that their their future in the playoffs kind of not rides on her, but you can't tell me you look at that lineup and save other teams are going to attack her side they should so. Yeah, so it's yeah that's going to be very interesting. The only thing you don't want to do if you attack her side is turn the ball over because if she gets to attacking your side, then you could be in some trouble.  But yeah, because that's her bread butter right there. Yes. I'm interested to see how Hinkle's game will change on the other side. She scored quite a fascinating goal said Nicole Barnard has had a wonderful season, but that was not a wonderful moment for her. Well going through her hands, but I think it's wild that here's Heather O'Reilly and you know, I give her so much credit because she could have hung it up after she finished on the international stage. She could have gone somewhere else where she  I have played more now. I know she went to North Carolina because that's where she lives with her husband, but not everybody who is Heather O'Reilly would be a backup outside back when you spend most of your career as a midfielder and forward and I think she'll relish the opportunity. They obviously haven't missed a beat yet, but it'll be tough when North Carolina and Chicago get involved.  Switch positions in their 30s after their big portion of their career, their International career is over. Not that it's crazy. I feel like most you know players. Hey, yeah, I want to come play for you know for kind of my hometown team for a little while and the coaches. Okay, I'll take you but your here's what you're going to be and I think there's a you know, what I'll just I'll just hang it up. I'm not learning a new position at the very last stage of my career when I'm kind of just want to ride. Oh the sunsets no doubt about it. Now. I know what a national team.  Always looking for a right back, right? Maybe she's looking for a way back in going to that right back spot.  All right. What else do we have coming out of the weekend? I guess Sam Kerr not bad breaks the rock 50 goals over three seasons now with a big chunk of time missing for the World Cup. Yeah, that's that's pretty crazy. The fact that he missed a couple of you know, those games and still broke. Her own record is going to get golden boot for according to an asylum on Twitter last night's this pill time in a row if you consider three and two  your cells and then to W leagues in between that's that's nuts. It's remarkable. It really is and but I think you and I agree when the playoff game rolls around its kind of time for her to have a big game and a big game so to speak for sure. Yeah. I think it's past time. She had a disappointing World Cup. She's hey was this point in the playoffs last year is kind of been disappointing in W League playoffs, I think.  You get all these accolades and they're very deserved but it is it is definitely time for her to have a big game and I think that Chicago's future rides on her having a big game now going back to the beginning of the Pod when you were saying you were disappointed with the inevitability factor with a three best teams being right back into playoffs. How much does that change if the red stars can break through and get to the final because I think we're almost pre-programmed at this point to think that the red stars will get in the playoffs and lose.  Can the semi I mean, I think it would be good for them to change the story around their team. And then that is  That is you know, it's impressive Theresa playoffs when you continually hit that hit that semifinal wall, you know questions start to be asked and when is a team good but not good enough and you have people that you know players that people want to call the best in the world and a variety of positions are among the best in the world. You have what for Gold Cup champions. I mean that roster is this act as it's ever going to be for Chicago and I think it was yeah, I think if at least they make it into the final first of all,  Said we wouldn't have a Thorns courage final again, which would be at least something different and I think that Chicago again this probably out of those three teams. The only one that looks better than they were less last season. Yeah, you kind of want to see that get rewarded. So yeah, I think it'd be it'd be interesting to see them go and very likely they'll get to storms in the playoffs whether we'll find out if that's in Portland. There's Chicago or if maybe the rain or Royals make a big run and spoil that but a red stars having beaten the thorns in six years.  Or so they've got to overcome that too. If that's the semi-final match. What a-what a storyline that would be for the first time in six years to be the first time. You also want to semi-final. Yeah for sure. That was their first pass use me their first win ever in the league was over the thorns and they haven't beaten them since yeah, what happened? I don't you know, it's not Total Domination of you those games have been close right there for four games this year. There's been a lot of other drawers. It's not like they say, it's not like they're totally bamboo.  But at some point you figure you got to get three points, so no better time to break out in the semis. Yeah. I think that when the team goes a long time without being another female. I think it was the same between Houston and the rain for three or four years. Yeah the last year there were no drawers there either. I was like 12 and hours. I'm like that 10 and now it's fascinating that some some teams just seem to have a Kryptonite over the other team and I was wonder why that is yeah. It's interesting team culture. I think is a very underrated talk.  The point in sport, so I will step out one more time will come back take a couple of questions from the Q a hashtag and wrap up on episode 77 of The Equalizer podcast.

Third and final segment on episode 77 of The Equalizer podcast and that means it's time for The Equalizer soccer sports referenced at of the week brought to you by our partners at sports reference check out there women's soccer staffs catalog at FB ref.com. That's FB ref.com. And for this week. Let's dive a little deeper into the streaks that have been extended North Carolina courage win the shield for the third time in a row that  Never happened before previously Seattle Reign FC won two in a row 2014-2015 Major League Soccer for a little bit of a parallel reference of they've always have more teams. It has never happened red stars. Meanwhile, they extended their streak of getting into the playoffs their league record to five years in a row. They lost 2015 to Kansas City 2016 to Washington the last  Two years to North Carolina, so maybe the fifth time will be a charm for the red stars. First time any teams ever been in the playoffs five years in a row Thorns. Meanwhile make it four years in a row in the playoffs which matches the courage / Flash and they have met up all three previous times Thorns losing to the Flash and 2016 beating the courage to win the title in 2017, and then losing to the courage in the final in 2018. So for  Coughs in a row and three straight shields for the courage League record extending now five straight playoffs for the red stars for straight playoffs for the thorns and let's throw in that Mark Parsons has now been a coach in the nwsl for six full seasons and he has been in the playoffs all six times The Only Exception when he took over the Washington Spirit Midway through what was very bad season 1 and they didn't make the playoffs and that folks is the sports reference status.  A week brought to you by FB rev.com or brought to you by Sports reference and check out their women's soccer SATs new and improved every day at FB ref.com Chelsea. Probably not your favorite stat of the week seeing since you were complaining about the lack of parity around the league, but how about Parsons six years in six playoffs doesn't get enough credit. I don't think for the jobs. He's done with his gloves over the years.  Yeah, I agree. I mean just from the start when he came in and took over Washington and you could tell a change from from that point on take them to the point. They did to jump to a completely completely different team completely different culture and also become arguably more successful with them. I think is truly impressive because I think that those are two completely different situations and he just took the opportunity and ran with it.  And it's funny if you talk to him and he can get him reminiscing a little bit. He'll say that you know that he always thinks back to 2013 or he would stay up all night and prepare for 12 14 hours a day and whatever we did still couldn't win a game, but certainly that has changed I let's get to the QA in the weeds says sky blue and Houston were surprisingly competitive this week. Will they spoil any playoff race has what's changed for them from blowouts?  You're in the season that didn't sky-blue already possibly spoil a playoff race. Yeah, that is that is correct definition of playing spoiler right there if things keep going this way Houston's got Washington on Wednesday on national TV, if they win that game they put Washington straight out of the playoff race sky blue then plays Orlando on Sunday. So that won't spoil anything sky-blue courage won't spoil anything as their finale.  The and used in is in Utah last day of the Season that that could be interesting because the rain are aw. No, they're not rain were in Orlando that last weekend and - or in Utah. So hey, maybe the - can yeah, maybe the - can do some damage. But yeah, well if both teams are playing better, I think the - are getting what's what's the opposite of regressing to the mean I guess, you know rising to what you should have been and you know, I mean, that's not good.  Crazy about sky-blue, either they still have what six wins and two years. So let you know what time I go crazy on that.  Yeah, I think you're you pointed out earlier with regards to do so. It was kind of weird seeing James Clarkson sort of starting to figure out things a little bit more to get to know his team better know what they're capable of and and get a better game plan for the opponents that he's facing. So I think that's what it is. They're sky blue is just I think they're doing what they're they're capable of which you're going to scrape out a couple of wins here and there and again like we talked about the rain should have won that game.  Yep, so they weren't they weren't the better team. They just sometimes these things happen were the better team doesn't win their shell Pro. So hopefully I got their pronunciation right with only the spirit and sky blue to play do the courage play aggressively for the win and intimidation factor, or do they lay back and protect the health and energy of the courage players for the playoffs Chelsea?  I don't think the courage of capable of just laying back. I think we're going to see more rotation than we did from previous courage teams. We've already seen that this year. He is going to rest some players, but they have one speed in this very very fast and particularly considering the momentum. They have the winning streak. They have the gold streak they have going on right now. I think it'd be a mistake to put any sort of a break to that totally agree and I'm generally not a fan of quote-unquote protecting the health and energy of players. I think Health, especially  Really? I think you're a pro athlete. There's a chance you're going to get injured every time out there. I don't think you expect overextend players to the point that they're going to be tired for the playoffs. But I think you got to go out there and play. So what they did last year I can we just talk for a minute about the McCall's are bony thing. I know she started last night, but how far has McCall's or boney's Star Fallen, right? If we did April 1st, we all thought you'd be on the World Cup team, I think and now she's barely starting for the cartridge.  Yeah, and I mean you can't really make an argument against either one. She's not had a great Forum this year. He's been fine, but not great. Maybe I think we always talked about in the past how her injury was kind of probably took more out of her than we saw but also what about maybe the mental aspect of it of getting that close to being on the World Cup team when that probably looked like a distant distant dream not too far, you know not too long ago for her or incredible rise. I  The national team and just to fall off so completely and then to the kind of to honestly be kind of Reserve now, it's I think if we're going into the final she's not your starter. So I think mentally you we have to say it considering how much that takes out of a player. Yeah. I don't think we consider that enough and I also think that when we do consider it we tend to assign mentalities two players and then expect them to live up to that assignment a hundred percent of the time which never happens. It's not really  Realistic and oh, she's known as one of the most positive people that you can meet. But that doesn't mean that there's not a breaking point because there is for everybody and I do think it was I do think she should have been on the World Cup roster unless maybe she was worse off physically then I realized what I do get a kick out of going to any time Casey short has a good game and I'll see in my Twitter mentions about how worst mistake Jill Ellis made not bringing cases short to the World Cup. Well, they won the World Cup, so how bad could stay  With Crystal Dunn 2015. How bad could the roster decisions have been if they won the tournament? Yeah. Well I said this in 2015 now stay in 2019 was the right call maybe maybe not we've talked about that extensively but you got to move on to some point two players sure as hell have yeah done moved on About a Week afterwards and started tearing up the nwsl and short to Casey courts. Probably going to be Defender Of The Year exactly. They've they've both dealt with it very well.  They're they're you know done made a way back on I'm have no doubt that you know, Casey towards already been called back in. I've no doubt that a new coach is going to going to get some looks at her. So you kind of have to stop harping on its honestly, it's probably the players probably get tired of hearing about it more than we do. They don't even if I did they miss Hunter World Cup gold speaking of that. How about short and sauerbrun getting called for P K's on the same day that I can't happen, too often. Yeah, and both of them were like they weren't  Most egregious I've ever seen but I think they were thousands of us, you know short had that look on her face after she committed the foul. I guess I guess you got me.  Kind of like I said, I think it was it was just one of those things where you have a maybe a little bit too much contact that came in a little bit to sauerbrunn was a little late. So it was a little hard it was the worst thing. It wasn't it wasn't as egregious as the the - in North Carolina one that was called. But yeah, that's that doesn't happen very often. They're both very clean players, but I guess everyone's human and on Alyssa naeher saving PKS you might have gotten a little bit of a gift from Katie naw naw Katie Norton Steph Houghton in the  Couple boy that was a nice havenõt this was definitely better better safe than the one. Yeah mentally maybe not have been as much pressure. But exactly the PTA was much better taken. That was an excellent safe. Yeah. There's been great since the World Cup Nichelle Proto again. What are the second and third backup plans for right back in case the first plan doesn't go? Well, I'm assuming that's also about the courage since the first question was too. I mean, I don't know if you have a second and third back-up plan for these things.  I mean, I think it's Paul Riley. I think he's got plenty of backup plans. And I think he is I think he could accept three. If for some reason I also think it has a release the best option of the ones he has I'll get back to that but I think you have Ryan Williams who I wouldn't go with because she's very very inexperienced. I think you have carrier Caro who I wouldn't go with because I don't think she has the pace required for a fullback Saint Paul Riley's team and to to suspect a couple years ago. You could play Chris and Hamilton there because he's done it before and briefly.  Briefly, I think she has he at now. There's a couple reasons you probably wouldn't want to I mean, first of all she does have the willingness but it's kind of like O'Reilly. She's not a Defender. I think he saw something in such good form this year. But if you're wanting to get both Lynn Williams just meet around up top, but he's doing it Chris Hamilton on the field. That's an option. But I think that with O'Reilly you have you have the paste to make up for positioning errors. She has the experience in big game moments. He has a wealth of  Of soccer in general that I think is a valuable to learning a new position. So I think that's probably the best option the one as we've seen when he's going to go with I agree and you know, what if a Riley also gets hurt and you have to go to your third option will not many teams do great things with their third options, you know? Yeah, and also they may be Dan don't put that out Universe for talk about Heather O'Reilly getting well, that's just it this is true. This is true. I'm waiting for my tweet to come back with an I said that it was probably the last  soccer game she would ever start a couple of weeks ago and they gave her that and it would have been I'm fairly confident of that would have been but I'm not I'm excited to see how she does rest of the way. All right Robert McCann. Can the red stars be Portland has moving herds and Davidson at centre-back made this team much better love your podcast. Hey loves the podcast what whiny why expand on that now? Uh, yeah, they can be Portland. Absolutely, but I think I think it's at all as  In the sense that the Thorns have their number like we talked about I would say I would give the coaching Edge tactically in that matchup to Parsons and I do think Earnest and David's in its Center back has been great. And I think it's also allowed cold a frico who's now seemingly healthy to do what she does best, which is sit on top of the back line and Emma have been saying that for years, but we're a anything different from you.  No, no, I think you covered it. And I mean obviously any team could be 19, but you give red stars of legitimate chance to win the game if they if it's a Portland semi-final. I think the red stars have as much of a chance right now is they ever have they're playing very well. Roy's figured out his probably his best lineup. I think that they need to give us renessa dibernardo back, but I think that they have more options Off the Bench here use Katie Johnson has been disappointing in Chicago, but  So can make some Nifty Things happened some saw some good back. He'll moments Saturday I think hers and find form and I also think the Portland is just not you're not getting the best out of Lindsay her and you're not getting the best out of their defense. You are getting the best out of I think I think it's interesting that Haley are also continues to be chosen over Caitlin Ford. I think I would I would definitely maybe make a different decision there. So I think they have a good  good of a shot as they ever had. We're about to go long here, but we did have a postponed game which again I think sometimes people like to pile on the nwsl. There's been games postponed across the Sports World for any number of bizarre reasons over the years. Then the - maybe weren't going to be able to get out of Houston the league suggested that they don't know how serious it was but the league did say, why don't you just stay in the Airport overnight when you get on a bus and go to another city, which is not  Totally ludicrous if it's safe enough to do it, but you know the league also lost more staff, which is someone that had just come on I think in June is now gone their final is in less than five weeks and the teams are drawing better and doing better. But the league still just seems to not be unstable footing. I don't want to spend too much time on this and we've gone long already, but just to address it. What are your thoughts on on the week that was  Was off the field.  I think that the league has some serious work to do in a variety of ways. We've seen a lot of Staff leave that haven't been replaced mostly in and I'm thinking of interpersonal media their their arm their media arm and I think we've seen that reflected we get emails later the sets update is quickly. We just they're just not as much going on there and I think that you look back to when that arm was created with mcclenahan running in how much better they did some  Of those things. It's disappointing to see that kind of kind of Fall by the wayside. And I don't know if it's just a holding pattern until they officially move that group to Chicago next year or what their long-term plan is, but that it's just it's so hard to get any sort of an answer of the league on anything. We don't ever get the sense that you know from obviously not being in behind the scenes, but we don't get the sense that anyone really knows what's going on. Sometimes people aren't unwilling to make concrete decisions and we saw that with the  If you have shared got drugged up way longer than it should have and you have to put that on the link sometimes I think that they don't have they don't have the staff there to make to do all the things that they need to do the stuff that they do have a very overworked and I don't think they have someone in charge puts their foot down and says, this is how it's going to be and everyone's just kind of waiting for somebody else to take that lead. And I think it's a problem.  That is all extremely well said we're also made maybe or maybe not getting an expansion announcement coming up. And you know, I pretty sure everyone who was in nwsl media on the content side when they when they need deal ended earlier this year is now gone and I don't know what's a replacement situation is but I'm pretty sure everybody who was there in the beginning of the year he's gone now and you know at some point they're going to have to realize they're running a pro sports league in they're going to have to treat themselves like a  Transport so you guys are going to have a very low ceiling to where they can get and that that would be a shame because I do think the ceiling is high if if run properly so the in interesting next couple of weeks as we go but yeah rain Royals on Wednesday was rescheduled from last week due to poor field conditions after excessive rain and Tacoma. Apparently not the first time it's happened at Cheney stadium. So be prepared for that. You've also got sky blue back at Red Bull Arena next weekend and I  Don't know if I mentioned this but a last word before we go on a positive note that 17,000 crowd. I know you guys did the Pod last week that 17,000 crowd at Audi field for their second straight game there. I think that's the single most impressive attendance number this League's ever put out.   Not the highest but the most impressive yeah. Yeah, I would agree. Alright, thank you very much. Once again for hanging out with me doing the podcast. This is episode 77. We'll see you next week. Thanks for listening to The Equalizer podcast.	It was a significant weekend in the NWSL, with the North Carolina Courage clinching the shield, and Chicago and Portland punching their respective tickets to the playoffs.  The rest of the race?  Still to be determined.  We break it all down in this week's episode.  
spotify:episode:2SfUG4VtJFkyiuNgHALlsC	All right. Now - just one second now I'm confused about something. Are you sure you're okay. I'm not sure what the true meaning of Christmas. All right, everybody. Let's do it do it check check check check check check check check. I told you we were done for the year, but you know what ten minutes past. Yeah. This is a little this is a little Christmas morning. Yeah - yeah during the first-ever Frank and Eric movie party episode where we watched National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation. We mentioned the music video for the Ghostbusters theme by Ray Parker jr. Mentioned Chevy Chase's appearance in that so we are going to watch the music video for Ghostbusters by Ray Parker jr. And we're going to make you sit through our recap of it. Yeah, you remember the hellish experience of watching National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation with us. We're going to do that only for like a few minutes and I think that but more obscure. Yes. Yeah something you have no point of reference for and Chad is an amateur.  Olli artist now and just sort of rattling things around and he's a prop comic now, it's not do that turbo is it's a TC. He's like ripping pieces of celery in half. He's going to pick which slide whistle to use for this. Yeah pop into coconuts in the ground. All right, so if you are following along if you  You want to continue this ridiculous Journey should go to YouTube go to the Ray Parker jr. Ghostbusters video and hit play now. No fun fact. Huey Lewis sued, Ray Parker jr. For copyright infringement because this sounds too similar to I want a new drug. Also a great song. I Love Huey Lewis. Huey Lewis also has Meniere's disease and which I have so, you know,  it does sound a lot like Huey Lewis.  But pretty erotic there's our iPhone on the wall. It's very looks like Tron. Yeah. What the fuck is this is Ray Parker jr. Himself a ghost in this music video. Why is it so fake high-tech children seems like he would not be advocating for the busting of ghosts. Oh my God, I can't believe I didn't even think to mention that he would be shout-out to Duncan from trivia dot cool for getting me a Ghostbusters Christmas or birthday.  Isn't this year in from the movie? Appreciate it?  Yeah, I'm always sure there's it's a lot of clips from the from Ghostbusters. Why are those kids in that haunted house? He's a ghost. Why aren't the stars of ghosts? Why are the stars of the movie in the video while they are in in clips from the movie now, we're gonna turn her later. It's like a weird neon fake. So Ray Parker is the fishing pole the pull that okay sheet off that.  Parker uses horny ghost energy to pull that ladies blanket down there in school with it, huh? I don't know who that lady is, but I've seen her in movies. How do you know?  Ghostbusters, great movie this video is this is bad strange. Very strange guys are crazy. This is great. No. No, I mean it's really good. We have a girl running around in in underwear. Basically that hallway reminds me of the hotel. We stayed at in Berlin.  John Candy's on Candy R.I.P. I love you. Okay. Yeah, she's just trying to get away from this creepy. Yeah, like he's trying not to get raped his hair like the girls. Yeah, why is very threatening? He's saying he's not afraid of ghosts. Yeah, very threatening. I think you've just discovered the logical problem in this video. Who is that some nobody? Yeah.   That's a cool mic stand. Yeah, Neon has someone else don't know that guy. We're in movies though. Yeah, I buy that mic stand to do the podcast. What's the point of having someone who's not in the movie in the video? Favorite Shot the movie love it. Oh my God, it's so good. How hot is Sigourney Weaver in this movie? Oh, she's fine. Yeah, it's amazing busting makes me feel good and you're not gonna say it's a come reference. Thank you.  We have some consistency with the podcast now.  What is it crying? He's like getting upset again. Threatening a woman. Okay, is that is that bad? I'm sorry. I got a real sour milk face from my wife on that. So now we had a hey that was what's his name? There's a brief shot of  Of the actual actors from sponsors dancing. Okay, we're back. It's very Smith returned. Yeah, do they are in the video? It's a real. Who's who whoever that is. Who's that? Yeah, I don't know. Is that who I was?  There are two totally random. Yeah, well that down. All right, that's it plus video write it you want to write. Yeah, let's let's individually rate the meeting. Yeah, I'll start with myself. I guess. What's the rating? It's like one through letter grade school doing let me know whatever I give it. Like I'm gonna go be plus I would give it an a  all right, I'm gonna give it a solid B. Hmm. I wish that it didn't lean. So heavily on random people head shots and just like clips from the movie. I wish there was a little more like immersion. Okay, Duncan. What do you think? I know you said letter grades. I'm gonna I'm gonna buy her everything. I like it because because effectively I'm giving it an A-Plus. I'm giving it a 99 out of 100 Wow's cry because it's easy to forget.  Of just how hard the song slaps what the song the song rule where it's about the video that video. Shut up songs part of it man. Okay song rules video is great. I love the celebrity cameos. They don't need to be explained. I just get a little bit lost in the dichotomy of Ray Parker jr. Himself being a ghost. I think so emanating for bus.  Austin goes I agree. That's why it's not a 100 out of 100 pick a side Ray Parker jr. But a plus 99 out of 100. All right.  Maya D D D D is greater than this is a Deeks. It's worse. Hmm seems fair. Okay. I know I think they all exist, you know independently. Our dog is having a sneezing fit. Okay, Maya noted Chad. What did you think?  Chad you're recording a podcast right now will point to on a letter grade here you get a 4.2 that's consistent for Chad.  Special effects were poor. They look did in an afternoon and then it was done in 1989 or whatever. It was an 89 87 weights earlier. Yeah, when was Ghostbusters? Yeah 86 for before early for and just try and she was pretty high-tech for 84 Frank. What do you I would say low marks for the for the rape rapey Vibes. Hi.  For the coming reference so a solid solid see solid C. Okay, Ray Parker jr. More like rape or occur jr. Got them. I got them. My score is still a plus it makes sense of wow ghost and it's advocating for busting ghosts. It's just like Slimer in The Real Ghostbusters. Look it up. Okay plus does okay, but the the weird cameos and Bobby  Know that yeah. Well, I love the Cameo. Okay. Alright. Okay. No, you don't like seeing George Wendt say Ghostbusters. Yeah, you're right fair point. They're like early cameos. Yeah. I mean that's it. Just did it to get yeah, you get a star in there. That's all that's all you need. They were just like in the in the studio at the time. They just grabbed whoever was around. They were having lunch and they're like, hey, I got to go to record this stupid music video thing you want to come with  Just say the word Ghostbuster have to do you just have to turn to the camera and say two words. Yeah cigarette. Yeah, and they're like, hey is your friend who's waiting for you famous? Yeah, bring them in here. No look at it will do that thing Jason. What would you give it a letter grade for I when I was a kid, I'm gonna I'm trying to go back in time to when I was a kid like I thought Ray Parker jr. Was Lando from Star Wars. I'm no that's awful to say but it's true. Zach is all black people look the same to you. So he  I'm sorry, so we cut that out. Did I make a make a racist joke you didn't you didn't know I think I did. Yeah. Yeah, you did. No, that wasn't even a joke. Yeah, you were just waving a racist flag over there. My grandma was like Tina Turner to is your grandma black That's my boy.  apart spaces or she a good singer  Did you have great thighs do you have do you have some sort of mental disorder where everyone looks like a famous black person dude? No, I don't Terry Crews. I was probably cut all this out. Is that bad? I don't know. I can't tell I guess it's bad. Sorry just bought it when I was a kid. I really did.  I'll just Hammer this thing with beeps. Don't worry. Yeah. Okay, Chad just jumped out the window. I might be the only thing I will say that I would like to share about this music video is that I had this on cassette and it was the first it was the first  Cassette that I got when I got a Walkman when I was in sixth grade or whatever and I got two cassettes and it was this it was the Ghostbusters soundtrack and I got the labamba soundtrack. Oh, yeah, I had a was not was walk the dinosaur. Well my first table that song also slaps. It's a garbage song at the what the fuck is Frank. I will not sit here. If you didn't you walk dinosaur. Well, it'll be our outro Eric you might recognize her to before.  Or a switch is over the door get on the floor everybody walk to dino. Yeah. I know that / that was your first those are first cassette cassette single. Yeah. Wow. I was like 7, I don't know. Yeah. Also, I promise it won't be racist but I think there we go. There we go. Yeah, just like all these people like Ghostbusters. It's like damn the guy from cheers loves Ghostbusters.  Of Ghostbusters too. Weird. Yeah, like I knew they weren't even in the movie. I fucking love Ghostbusters. So I knew they weren't in I was just like yeah, I like it. The guy from cheers likes it. Everybody likes it. I didn't think that your take was racist. FYI. I did not novices.  Anybody else got a first cassette story? I think mine was Weird Al Yankovic's off the deep end - Bon Jovi Slippery When Wet oh hell yeah. It was a present. Somebody gave it to me for my birthday. Wow. I specifically asked for Weird Al Yankovic's off the deep end. I think mine was there to be stupid. Hmm my pants.  What occurred was I give Frank a dirty? Look first record was bright and then I had Pac-Man Fever. There you go. Also to finish up the fun fact when Huey Lewis sued Ray Parker jr. For copyright infringement. It was secret. It's a secret. Nobody knew about this but part of the settlement was Huey Lewis can never talk about it, huh?  But like five years ago Huey Lewis was just like in an interview is like, yeah, I assumed that guy and then we won had to like pay all the money back to him for that day fucking blew it.  Really do that one. Then. He lost his human being Ray Parker jr. And phone call. Yeah, right. Hello. I've been waiting for this call. I mean that's been like a massive windfall. Oh, I'm sure there's two things that make me feel good getting all the settlement money back from 25 years ago and busting ghosts Frank. Yeah. I know. Yeah. Yeah.  Okay, that hasn't been our mini episode for Christmas. This will come out on Christmas day. Merry Christmas Merry Christmas. Happy holidays Chad. Just hang in again in like a minute. Got it.

During the first ever Frank and Eric Movie Party episode, we mentioned the music video for the Ghostbusters theme by Ray Parker Jr. in reference to National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation.  So we made you sit through the video and recap it.  We also talk about the
spotify:episode:2c2WPjRpoCSxtnAw0WsoqG	What is up? Everyone? Alright, so I've been promising to make a podcast for a very long time and I said I would start it in 2020. So it's time to do that. I don't know if anyone's actually going to listen to this, but I'm going to make it. Anyways, I don't have an intro. I don't even know how I'm going to upload this or where I'm going to upload this to but going to do it anyways, so  I wanted to start out the whole podcast thing with a pretty important topic for this time of year and that's being successful with whatever goals you set for 2020. Now a lot of people are going to set goals and that's normal. A lot of people may have never even set foot in a gym before and it can be really intimidating but there are things you can do do and the  Ways you can approach things that you can actually be successful the first thing to realize that there's millions of people setting New Year's resolutions right now where they already set them but a lot of Statistics show that only like 25 percent of those people actually stick those stick to those goals for even 30 days, which is honestly not that surprising people make unrealistic goals and they just can't stick to them.  And those same studies only show that like eight percent of those people actually accomplish the goals that they set which is that's like nothing. So almost all of the people that are going to set goals this time of year don't actually complete them, but I'm going to try to help and give you guys some tips that can put you in that 8 percent you can actually get to where you want to be now. It's not anything.  It was the biggest the first biggest issue is just that people set unrealistic goals. You have to be honest with yourself and actually set goals that you can accomplish. You're not going to lose 300 pounds in a year. You're not going to completely transform your body and be a professional bodybuilder in a year going from never working out before in your life. It took you 20 30 years of poor habits to get to  are you are now it's going to take it's not going to take that long to correct it but it's going to take some time and it's not something that's going to happen overnight. So the first thing you want to realize is that you don't need to be intimidated by the gym. The biggest thing I see holding people back from even getting started. It's just that they're afraid to go to the gym. They're intimidated by it. This happens with people all the time. I went through this with my parents trying to get them into the gym.  Past year and honestly, everyone that gets past that initial intimidation actually goes you you realize that it's not intimidating. So they're the people that you see at the gym. First of all that you think are intimidating. Usually the bigger guys the more fit people the stronger women, whatever it may be most of those people don't give a flying fuck what you are doing there in there to better themselves. They don't  care what anyone else is doing and they're focused on themselves and you could be doing the most ridiculous shit in the gym and they don't care they're there for themselves as our most people and then a lot of the other people that are in there are in the same spot that you are their feeling intimidated. They don't really know what they're doing. They're not worried about anyone else. They're just worried what other people are thinking about them and honestly, you don't need to worry about what anyone else thinks now, of course is going to be a few people that might be in there.  Judging other people and making fun of people, but honestly, those people are just projecting their own insecurities on others. So even if they have a negative opinion of anyone else in the gym there and Penny their opinion doesn't fucking matter. They're just they're just a well garbage human being but don't worry what anyone else thinks you're in there to better yourself and everyone else in there is in there for the same reasons there whatever their goals are there trying to better themselves, so don't be  Intimidated just by going to the gym. Once you go a few times you're going to realize that it's not intimidating. And the other thing when you start out is don't try to compare your progress to other people. Everyone's on their own Journey. You're on your own Journey. You have everyone has a different starting Place. Some people are trying to build muscle. Some people are trying to lose body fat some people who never worked out before in their lives. They're just trying to figure out how to get themselves to the gym.  Since some people have been working out for decades and some people have amazing genetics. It's just everyone's at a different place has different potential you want to realize that no matter where you are or what you're doing. You can drastically improve your standpoint from where you're at right now, but some people will see progress so slower. Some will see progress faster. Any progress is progress. It doesn't need to happen overnight. You need to focus on  The long-term game and just do the best that you can now once you actually get yourself to the gym.  you might see how a lot of people moving a lot of weight doing things that seem a little bit crazy and that might also be intimidating but I see this especially with guys the problem here is people get so caught up with what other people are doing and what they see other people can do they focus so much on how much weight they put on the bar how much weight there lifting when you start out  The weight you put on the bar the way you're doing and your movements. It's pretty much irrelevant form overall is so much more fucking important than the weight you're using if you spend the first couple months of your training, obviously you want to focus on getting stronger over the long run. That's what's going to lead to progress. But you really really want to dial in your form. There's a lot of amazing resources on YouTube some on Instagram Facebook, whatever it is for.  Online there's so many good resources for videos on how to use correct form. Go study those work on improving it each week. If you can get your form down you're going to set yourself up for a very successful long long duration of progress. It's pretty much one of the most vital things you can do to build a good foundation. If you start out learning to do things wrong and focus on getting stronger.  Longer while doing them wrong. It's going to be a hell of a lot harder to correct that years down the road than it is right. Now when you don't have a lot of past experience with those things, you can instill good habits at the beginning so you don't have to worry about correcting them later and it's going to help prevent from injury, which would also set you back and keep you from reaching your goals. So you really want to focus on that and then the other another thing is don't set unrealistic.  Big expectations for yourself. I said this before the beginning but when you set unrealistic expectations, you just you're setting yourself up for failure. You're going to get discouraged. You might not get there as fast as you want to and then you give up. I see it happen all the time with people especially people that are working out on their own. They don't have someone to guide them. They think they can do this ridiculous stuff in 30 days to months, whatever a lot of  those Transformations you see online are there fucking fake there either photoshopped or manipulated in a bunch of different ways that make them seem a lot more impressive than they actually are and some of them are just outright lies and completely fake. So don't get caught up in like I said before don't get caught up in other people's progress and don't let that set unrealistic. Especially explore the fuck. I can't even talk don't  Unrealistic expectations for yourself think of something that's manageable. If you're trying to lose weight losing like one to one-and-a-half not even one and a half like half to one percent of your body weight per week is amazing. That might not seem like much let's say you're 200 pounds and you want to lose 40 pounds. Well one to two pounds a week doesn't seem like very much but in a year, you'll be past your goal and  and you're doing it in a sustainable manner that you can actually maintain you're not trying to lose 30 pounds in 30 days anything like that? Yeah, you might see progress faster, but it's a hell of a lot more important that you see progress that you can sustain versus Fast progress. I was like to tell people think about where you want to be like five years from now. So if it take let's say it takes you a year or two years to lose 40 pounds, but you do it in a way that you can sustain  You can maintain that progress and you're not going to backtrack afterwards. You'll you can maintain that afterwards and then you'll be in a great standing point in three four five years. You'll be able to keep that look that you get to but let's say you take a really drastic approach. It only takes you two or three months like a quarter of the time to lose that much weight. You lose the 40 pounds awesome. You absolutely crash dieted you run yourself into the ground you feel like shit.  If you can't maintain it and then after you lose those 40 pounds you go back to what you were doing before and you gain it all back. Sometimes you even gain more back and then a year down the road you get 50 pounds to lose and then you're mad at yourself. You're not seeing any success and then you just kind of let everything go to shit and then five years down the road. You're in the exact same spot you started so it doesn't really matter how long it takes you to get there. It matters that you're consistently making progress in the right direction, whether that's fast or slow. You just need to make progress. That's all you need to worry about.  You don't need to worry about it happening overnight because it's not going to happen overnight and usually if it does happen overnight, it's not something you can sustain.  Now after you kind of have a saint a bit plan set in place for realistic expectations and you you're going into the gym and you found a good work. So actually that's an important thing. You want to find a really good workout program. If you can find a coach you can afford a coach that would be your best option because it's they're not only going to set you up with a good plan, but they're also going to help you along the way.  You on track and keep you from completely falling off. It's going to be that that outside support can be a huge difference. But let's say you can't afford that there's plenty of options out there for good plans that can teach you a lot and are not very expensive. I would say a really good place to start every most of the people that follow me know. I'm a big proponent of Legion the owner the owner of Legion Mike Matthews. He's written a lot of books two of his books.  Bigger leaner stronger, which is the guy version and thinner Lee's leaner stronger, which is the female version by Mike Matthews. You can get those on Amazon super cheap. They're like 10 bucks. Probably the best 10 bucks. You'll ever spend in your life. It covers nutrition and training has multiple training programs and it's all focused on the basics. You don't want to overcomplicate things. You want to just focus on the basics the big compound movements learn how to bench. Learn how to squat learn how to  Deadlift if you're intimidated by those you can find regressions from them that are simpler and work your way up but focus on the basics and focus on getting better at them focus on the good form like I talked about before the other thing to keep in mind once you get into the gym and have a good plan in place is don't be afraid to make substitutions for your workout. So let's say  You're supposed to do squats or you're supposed to bench and all of that equipment is taken this time of year. If you're just starting out. It's by far the busiest time of the year in the gym. It might be packed, especially if you're working out in the evenings if you're working out in the mornings or early afternoon. You should be just all right, but if you're working out in the evenings might be really packed and you might not be able to get to the equipment you want. Now, I've seen a lot of people that I can't get the workout in I'm supposed to do so, I'm just going to not do anything doing something is so much.  Better than doing nothing and you can always substitute a similar exercise for something you're supposed to do. Let's say all the barbell benches are taken. Okay, go do an incline barbell bench or go to the dumbbell section and do a dumbbell bench. If even if all of that's taking go to one of the machines and do a machine chest, press do something same with squats. Let's say you can't squat you could go do a goblet squat with dumbbells. You could go do walking lunges you could do a leg.  Press whatever do something. You could do a hack squat find some piece of equipment or something. You can use that's similar and working the same muscles and do it. Now. If you can get what you were supposed to do in the plan that's optimal. But if you're finding something similar that's going to be just great. You just need to do something because doing something is always drastically better than doing nothing.  Now another thing to realize once you get into the gym and it's so you're not always going to be motivated when you go to the gym. Honestly motivation in general is just absolute bullshit because it's extremely short-lived. So you might go to the gym first couple days. You're really excited about your goals and you  Feel really motivated or whatever you want to call it. Yeah, that's great. It's a great way to get you started but that's not going to last and that's okay. It's just normal. No one's motivated to do something all the time. What's important is that you have a goal set in place or a plan set in place and you just stick to that plan. You need to be you need to have determination about getting to your goal. There's going to be plenty of days when you're not actually motivated. There's going to be days when you don't  Want to do absolutely fucking anything is going to be days when you don't want to go to the gym. There's going to be days when you don't want to eat right? Well when that happens, you have to think about the goal. You're actually trying to get to and how important that is to you if you're actually determined and dedicated to getting towards that goal and moving in the right direction. That's what matters sometimes you're not going to feel a hundred percent going into the gym. There's going to be a lot of times you don't feel huh.  3% going into the gym, but going in and getting some work in. Anyways, you're going to be really happy that you did it. Sometimes you just have to get your ass to the gym and do it. You're not always going to be super excited about doing it, but that doesn't matter so stop looking for that motivation or something like you need this specific mindset to be able to do anything just because you don't feel a hundred percent as long as you have a little bit of determination.  Asian to get moving towards your goal you just do that and go put in some work that's literally all there is to it so don't get down on yourself if you don't feel motivated because motivation is just fucking bullshit. So just push yourself towards reaching that goal and get in and do it anyways.  And that's mostly covers the training aspect of things and let's get into the nutrition aspect of things a little bit because I know a lot of people like I talked about before going to be wanting to make crazy progress and do all these extremes. Well just avoid the biggest advice I can give you is avoid fad diets avoid anything. That's absolutely extreme anything that is restrictive. I mean a dieting  Itself, you're going to be restricting some but good way to put this anything that demonizes any specific thing. So anything that's there's good and bad food anything that tells you to cut out certain specific things. That's generally just bullshit. It's a fad diet. There's nothing special about it. If you want to see progress you need to restrict your calories and focus on more nutrient dense foods the best.  Advice I can possibly give you if you're just getting started started out is download an app like MyFitnessPal and just start tracking your calories make yourself more aware get yourself a food scale so you can weigh your food out to understand portion sizes and actually how much you're eating because volume measurements can be really inaccurate and even people would have been tracking for a long time are can be horrible at eyeballing portions. I promise you that if you're trying to eyeball your portion sizes, you're completely wrong and almost always  Zooming way more than you think you are. So track your Macros track your calories. If you have a good plan set in place, if you got like bigger leaner stronger thinner and leaner stronger the books or you have a good coach. You'll have a way to get macros and calories kind of set up towards your goals and you can work your way towards getting better at those over time. You don't need to be super anal about tracking your calories or tracking your calories. Yes, but  You don't need to be need to be super specific about hitting exact macro numbers. Those are just think of those as targets as guidelines. You don't need to hit them. Exactly just kind of be closed think about the ratios that you're aiming for a name to be close to that calories are more important than macros macros are important. I would say the first priority is trying to get enough protein aiming for around Point 8 to 1 gram per pound of body weight and then eating enough fats for healthy hormone.  Action and then the rest of your calories from carbs, but if you're just starting out just focus on tracking calories and understanding how much you're actually consuming. There's no such thing as good foods and bad foods. The only way I would view it is it's a spectrum of more nutrient dense foods and less nutrient dense foods. And if you're eating mostly more nutrient dense foods, it's totally fine to include some of those less nutrient dense foods. As long as you track it. You keep an eye on  ION portions you practice moderation that's going to be a lot more sustainable in the long run than it doing anything excessively restrictive. I never put my clients on anything really restrictive. It's just it's not sustainable and it's not beneficial for long-term progress.  If you are looking for a little bit more information on nutrition in general, I do have an article on my website. That's W Camp coaching.com. You can just go to the article page and there's one on the basics of nutrition and making progress that's going to cover a lot of the nutrition aspects of the things just to help you get a good foundation of knowledge doing that and tracking.  Calories in macros you should be on the right track just adjusting them accordingly. If you're not losing weight after a couple weeks you do want to if you have a plan set in place. Let's say a calorie Target a macro Target and you are hitting it. Well don't adjust after not losing weight and a couple days. Sometimes it takes time give yourself like two weeks. And if you're making absolutely no progress then maybe a think about adjusting but give it time progress takes time just because you're not dropping.  Being weight right away doesn't mean you're not in a calorie deficit doesn't mean you're not on the right track things take time. So take it slow and just keep a good eye on everything. I would recommend checking your weight at least a few times a week. If not a habit of making it every day. Just so you can get a better idea of progress. You're actually making. Let's see if you download an app like MyFitnessPal you can log your body weight in there and just keep a trend over.  Because of time you can see if you're trending downwards. You're always going to have body weight fluctuations. Don't freak out if you gained a couple pounds in one day, you might just be retaining some water. Maybe you got less sleep maybe didn't drink enough water. So that's something a lot of people freak out about when they're getting started out. They'll see these big fluctuations in weight. They'll see a big weight drop and they'll get super excited. They'll see their weight Spike back up no freak out and sometimes say fuck it and then they'll just  Go eat like shit because well, I gained a couple pounds. I'm not making progress. No, you're just retaining a little bit of water. You're absolutely fine. Just move forward and be consistent the absolute best advice. I can give you overall is just be consistent be consistent with your training follow the plan get in as many days as you can at least according to your session. You ought to be working out every day, but on top of that try to keep your activity level up giving the that's a  I was just going for some walks everyday taking your dog for a walk spending a little bit of time on the treadmill cleaning the house. Whatever. It is something you enjoy whether you enjoy biking or walking or hiking whatever just do some things to stay active and keep your calorie expenditure out that's going to help a lot and then tracking your calories and being consistent with your nutrition.  So overall, like I said before setting a goal for yourself is great, but just you have to realize that that goal. It's probably going to take a lot longer than you think it's going to take to get there. And once you get to that goal, it's not over. This is your setting up yourself for the rest of your life. You want to focus on making Lifestyle Changes focus on enjoying your workouts focus on nutrition that you can see yourself falling.  Wing for a long period of time and just gradually make changes to push yourself in the right direction because even if you have a goal right now, you might reach that and realize you want to take things further or then you set another goal it never just ends. If it just ends if you get to your goal and say fuck it, I'm done. I'm going back to what I was doing before. You're just going to end up in another few months or a year or a couple years. You'll be right back to where you were before so you have to focus on  On changing your habits and being okay with that so make new habits and just don't be too extreme with it. You want to make things that are sustainable and that you can do for the a long period of time.  You are at some point you are going to fuck up. Everyone fucks up. Its might happen frequently. It might happen a few times. Let's say you miss a few workouts or you eat like shit for a couple days or you go out and totally blow out your calories you get drunk and then you go eat a bunch of Taco Bell at the end of the night. Well, that's that happens. That's life shit's going to happen. You just got to move forward and go right back to what you were doing before get right back on track. You have to know going into  To it that you're not going to be perfect all the time. Everything's not going to be 100% all the time. That's completely fine. You're going to screw up at different points. And as long as you know that going into things and you know how to approach that. You know that you don't need to do some restream extreme restriction after you fuck up. You don't need to just say screw it and give up on everything because you have been consistent for months and then you screw up.  One day or one week or a couple days. It doesn't matter. Just go back to it and get back in the groove of things right away, and you'll be just fine. You really have to try to focus on the long run. I see so many people that get hung up when they have one little slip-up or whatever whether it's training nutrition. Just being lazy or even let's see you injure yourself or you get sick and then you don't want to get back to doing anything. Just go back to normal. You'll be just fine moving.  Don't let little stupid things like that. Get you hung up and stop you from actually progressing towards your goals. So just realize that that's going to happen at some point and fucking up to some degrees completely normal. You just have to get back on track and keep moving forward.  I guess that's about it.  I'll leave with one really good piece of advice that I absolutely love and that is you need to work out because you love your body not because you hate it. It's great to set goals for yourself. It's great to want to better yourself. But if you're trying to change things because you absolutely hate your body. It doesn't matter how far you progress yourself. It doesn't matter what physique you get to or how much weight you can lift whatever if you are in that.  Type of negative mindset at the end of the day. It doesn't matter where you get to it's probably not going to change that mindset and you're still going to feel that way. You have to come to terms with that you're training you're eating better because you love your body and you want to live a long happy successful life not because you absolutely hate where you're at right now and you're just trying to punish yourself from what you were doing in the past. That's not going to get you anywhere. It's not going to put you in a healthy mindset. So  Workout because you love your body not because you hate it.

spotify:episode:6oZYPfBhCdpTSamM9Uj0v9	Oh, so you have to do a lot eight game. It was just an exhibition game, but I had missed like six free throws and you know ever since then I was just watching film on just my balance and stuff and you know, eventually means those wages got the other and was just like, you know, you won't work together on free throws after practice every day. So, you know, we still 50 free throws and you know just happening able to make a night out of 10. So everyone matters in so, you know, I feel like there's definitely helped me, you know to this point.  What's up, everybody? Welcome to another edition of boot up the LSU basketball podcast. I'm Cody worship digital media reporter Brandon Smith Athletics. Glad you could be with us today. Got a very special edition of The Show for you sat down for about a 15 minute conversation with LSU freshman forward Trend in Watford this interview took place last week after LSU knocked off, Arkansas. At home to improve 22.0 in the conference. They've won two more games since then trendin was fantastic and that Arkansas game. He was fantastic again. Last night is LSU went on the road and beat Texas AM to improve to four in a row on the conference. LSU hasn't lost a game in two seasons on the road in the SEC, which is one of the best accomplishments in college basketball. If you ask me, it's really hard to win on the road anywhere especially in a league with as much parody As the SEC and  Anna was a big part of that last night. I believe you finished with 19 points 11 rebounds 6 assists and he's really coming into his own. I will do some more analysis of this team in the coming weeks with some more episodes today. I'm going to stick with just the interview with trendin and some of you may be like me where you were so caught up in football that basketball hasn't quite gotten the attention that you normally give it. I regret that I wish there was something I could do about it, but I have a lot of responsibilities with football especially during football season, especially when the team is having the success.  Pad so I've tried to give as much attention of as well as I could you've heard me talk about them as podcast. If you've been listening if you haven't been listening and you're just joining in to listen to this podcast and kind of getting back into basketball mode welcome. I'm excited about this basketball season. This team is really good there for and on the conference. They've won a couple games that maybe they shouldn't have one. If you look at it just statistically or maybe the way the game felt the the game-winning shot that Skylar hit the other night was phenomenal against us against Mississippi State.  Maybe that's a game that LSU quote-unquote shouldn't have won by the metrics by some of the numbers. But if you remember we'll wait talked in the build-up to the conference play and I believe we played this on the show. In fact, we did played on the show. He talked about the fact that LSU lost a couple games in the non-conference that they felt they should have won with USC and Utah State any hope that would even out. Well, it's starting to even out. I don't know if LSU's won two games that they shouldn't have one, but they were almost a fortunate but things went their way and the right way to be Mississippi State. I thought they'd help.  Arkansas to win that game, but they needed some late heroics from training to win that game as well. But things are starting to even out there. So it's good to see the teams playing. Well, they're doing some things really well to help them when they still have a lot of work to do though. Not only in terms of taking care of the conference late as the schedule gets tougher and tougher as conference goes on but they also have some things to improve within themselves. So we'll talk about all that will break that down. I've got some plans. I've got some people that I want to bring on the show. I plan to do some more player interviews. I have one with him it  Williams in my back pocket that I'm going to use in a future episode. So I've got plenty of basketball coming your way. I'm going to hit it hard. I promise another footballs done and that's in the rearview mirror jumping straight into basketball full steam ahead. You guys have an expectation for me those that have been listening for a while of the type of basketball coverage that I'm going to do. Hope to meet or exceed those expectations coming up. So again, thanks for your patience. If you've been waiting for more episodes, there will be more episodes coming up promised at least one a week, maybe two one weeks where it makes sense, so  All about that and again, if you're new to the show, if you're just coming over from football if if you've been caught up in football or you've never really listen to this podcast before welcome and I'm excited about what's coming ahead. So let's go ahead and get to the interview with turn and wide for a really good conversation turned into a real sharp guy just as good of an interviewer as he is or interviewee. I guess as he is a basketball player and a good conversation with Trend and we get into some of his history and how he became as good as he is hinda. I kind of gave him some  Look because look I don't think it's fair. I don't think it's fair that someone can be that tall and that's killed and that talented if you're that tall, you should just be not very skilled. Like you should just be able to play around the rim in my opinion as a guy who played the game and was not tall and not particularly skilled either but I tried to emphasize this skill more in my personal game being six foot tall. I thought that might be necessary and then I see guys that are 610 like Trend and who can step out and shoot threes. They can handle it on the on the fast break and then go put up 1911 to 6 in the SEC and it just makes me a little jealous. So we talked about  I was turning we talk about his history growing up as a Lakers fan and what it was like to play in the Staples Center where Kobe Bryant his Idol played and where his favorite team played growing up. So lots of good stuff with Trend that's going through that interview again. I'll be back LSU's foreign on the conference. There's lots of talk basketball wise we're going to stick with just the interview for today. Allow me some time to dig into the film learn a little bit more about this team that I know just from the few games that have been able to catch in full and I'll be back with with much more in-depth takes on this.  Team and conversations about this team. So again here without further Ado. Is that interview with LSU freshman for Trend in Watford? All right good to sit down for a few minutes with LSU freshman Fortran and Watford training. We picked a good time to do this interview. I guess credit to Caleb for setting this up, but you had a pretty good game last night. Would you say that's the best game that you've played so far 21 points or is it nine rebounds a couple big buckets late? They are against Arkansas. Is that the best game of your career so far? Oh, yeah, I think no that's definitely one.  Miss ones I had  What do you think is has happened for you these last few games where you started to round that corner? Obviously, you have all the talent in the world 610. You can handle it. You can shoot it. You can drive it but it seems like these last couple games in particular starting to get really comfortable what's happened in that time where you're trying to find that Comfort. Well just get more comfortable with the game. You know, I feel like I feel like the games got a little slower for me, you know early on it was pretty fast paced game, you know, I had the master physicality, but you know, I felt I just watch them film watching Family closure with coach hire its help.  A lot of so I feel like you know, that's definitely you know, a big reason why you know, I'm just starting to be consistent with it's one of the things that you know, when I watch you play I kind of think to myself it's not fair. It's not fair that you're that big and that skill like you shouldn't be able to have both my opinion because when I played like I wasn't as big obviously I wasn't a skilled either but you know, it's just not fair. I don't think you should be that big and that talented but which came first was at the size or was it the talent that came first for you the size the size. Definitely. I've always pretty much been.  Unlike pretty much tall so, you know and I was always just work just worked on my perimeter game a lot, you know, like coming up. My dad used to never let me like really play in the post. You just used to always like let me put on me a lot of input on Perimeter. So I would say they're pretty much just help me all the way until you know until I just trying to plan on the post and then they are you know, both of those just kind of mix together when you talk about being a big kid, like put it in perspective for me. Were you always like the tallest kid in your class? Like were you one of those things where you kind of naturally gravitated toward a spot on your brother played, but did you stab?  One other sports what was kind of your athletic career like coming up now, I've always wanted to play basketball but you know just always being the biggest I was being the biggest kid in the classroom, you know, everybody everybody, you know, eventually going to say you I know you play basketball and we play football but it was basketball for me because I was just always follow my brother around you does as a young kid just always been behind him. So, you know just say that was pretty much the reason so a lot of people know this but some don't that your brother was very good basketball player played in Indiana hit that famous shot and Assembly Hall against Kentucky. What are your memories of just  And of his career, what's the age Gap there? I know he's he's a big influence on you. I see him at all the games and everything, but just what's your relationship like with him and as he was growing up being an elite player and kind of how you followed in his footsteps. Well, I release it was very strong, you know, he's living out here now, so, you know, just you know, when he was coming up. I was just always around him. Are you high school college, even if he was even if he's playing in the pros, so, you know, I was just always been around him just been watching him play. So, you know, it's definitely helped me, you know to this point so, you know just being around him in college and during atmospheric  Like yesterday, you know, I've always just been around it. So, you know, it definitely helped me when you're when you're watching him play and come up and he's playing in big games. Do you feel like that's help you most from like the mental side where when you're in a big moment like yesterday. Yeah. It doesn't seem too big or is it something where you kind of knew like? Okay. This is what it takes training wise like physically to get there. How did it which way is it helped you the most this is help me, you know, they just keep calling. You know, I've always just you know, I've seen him play, you know to see him play in atmospheres like that. So, you know, it's just always help.  Me and you know just play early just playing earlier in the college career like and just sold out Arenas against like VCU and stuff. You know, I would say that was pretty much the that was pretty much the first time where I was like, you know, like it's real like he's actually no college basketball. So, you know, that's definitely helped me. How old were you when you realize you got a shot not just to be, you know, a good basketball player like the best kid in your class, whatever but like okay like the biggest schools in the country are coming after me. I'm going to be a five star kid at what point did it kind of turned for you or you knew you were gonna be that kind of talent I would say I would say my  Great my eighth grade year eighth grade summer, you know, I started going to like, you know, pretty much National camps and stuff. So there's a lot of like Scouts looking at me and stuff and then, you know just start getting recognized by college coaches and stuff. Damn. So I was pretty much had my eighth grade year. It's like the biggest thing you've overcome biggest obstacle guy as talented as you with the size that you've had think there might be a perception like he's just so naturally gifted but you've obviously worked hard to get where you are and I'm sure there's some things you have to overcome. What are the biggest challenges because hurdles you had to overcome in your career one of the biggies.  Has her toes, I probably had to overcome and they pretty much changed. My basketball career is when I think is my tenth grade. Yeah, I got cut from the USA national team. And you know, I will pretty much say that was the biggest obstacle that I had to overcome. You know, just I work I work so hard just try to make the team and I end up getting cut but you know to put everything in perspective, you know, you got always work harder and you know, just just believe in yourself. So have you transformed since then did you attack certain aspects of your game? But you work on your body? What were the biggest things you learned from that they had?  After that, you know, I just started I just started working hard just stand in the gym a lot and they're staying working on my brother a lot. And then you know that that next year after that. I'll just start changed my body and just working on my body a lot. So that was pretty much it. I think it's safe to say that you you work and you work out in an interesting locker room with some interesting guys some big personalities Emmett who was just walking by Darius or some big Personalities in there. How do you kind of fit into that mold? Are you more of a laid-back guy? Do you like to get in there and mix it up with them? How do you kind of fit?  It personality-wise with the steam. Oh, we all fit. We all feel good. You know, I feel like they've when I got here they welcomed me with open arms, you know, I had already had a close relationship anyway, and she wants a Smart there is day. So, you know, I was pretty much gel together pretty good and you know all of us just as close as you were just like Brothers now, so what was your like welcome to college moment like the moment where you realized? Okay, this isn't high school basketball anymore. Maybe it was in the summer with Greg golden working out or maybe it was Will Wade making you run sprints or something. What was  That moment for you, I would say, you know just going again. I'll probably say going to use dairies days and Evan Williams a lot. You know, I was always on the opposite team other opposite team them so, you know just having to box them out of stuff, you know, sort of gave me a welcome to college, you know, welcome to college, you know, just welcomed. So just being from that just just them boxing me out and them just you know, pushing me around when I got here, you know, it was just it was just a welcome college experience. So how is so far your experience at LSU measured up to expectations. I know you come in  in high expectations for yourself personally high expectations for the team. But also just the experience that going to classes and being around students going to football games. How is that kind of measured up to what you expect and what's been different what's been kind of what you expected owes more than I expected. You know, I'm loving it here, you know, obviously the football teams having a great year. So he knows a lot of hype around campus and I just met I met great people, you know, since I've been here so, you know, I was just say it's definitely been a great experience getting to play with with Darius and Emmett. I think you all have a very unique  Line up because Daris is almost like a four man who admits kind of like a four or five your kind of a guy that can play all the cross. You can play this big lineup. It's big in terms of size, but they're still all the skill there of a smaller line of how much fun is that to play in What challenges does it pose with opportunities is a present. Oh, it's definitely fun playing with them. You know, we're big lineup seeking lines six seven, six five six six. So, you know, I think you know, I think that's definitely an advantage to us, you know, obviously we're doing you know, we're doing good on the glass. So that's definitely an advantage for us.  You know just being big across the line. So it definitely helps us and you know, we just all love playing with each other. Let's talk about free throw shooting because we talked about it last night at the at the press conference and obviously that's been a big part of your last two games. I think you're like 12 years last 14. You're a good shooter. I mean we can all see that you can you can knock down shots, but there was that time early in the season where you're probably shooting. I don't know below 60% or something at what point did you think to yourself? Right? I need to work on this and this is something I need to dedicate to it. How have you gotten from that point where you were struggling at the line to where you are now where?  Are making big free throws in big moments. I would say I would say after the a lot of take game. It was just an exhibition game, but I had missed like six free throws and you know ever since then I was just watching film on just my balance and stuff and you know, eventually man because wages got together. I was just like, you know, you just wanna work together on free throws after practice every day. So, you know, we shoot 50 free throws and you know just have to be able to make a 9 out of 10. So everyone matters in so, you know, I feel like that's definitely helped me, you know to this point well was talking about it last night. He said that  You know at first when we were first doing it, it would take a little while. And then now it's almost surprising when you don't make that twenty two out of 25 that 9 out of 10. You remember some of those early days be in there a little bit longer. How long like what was like the longest you were in there for? Oh, no, it was just it was time to everybody everybody at the gym mean. It was just still in there me I'm just feeling they're trying to you know, just correct it and make free throws. But yeah, it was definitely it was definitely a hard time, you know earlier in the year. Just trying to correct it and  You know, I think you know now you know now it's just about there. So do you think like what's helped most is just the physical repetition of working at so many times or did you develop a routine? Did you develop something that made you more comfortable with the line? How did you kind of turn that corner? I've changed my routine. If you look if you look at early in the year, I was doing the you know, my feet were not so spread it out apart and I didn't leave back and then rock into it but it's definitely, you know, definitely changed my routine and I took my time, you know, just start taking my time at the line with even more so I felt  It's definitely helped me just you know, just calm down and just knocking me. How did you develop that routine? I remember being like a kid in the way that I would shoot free throws. I just watched somebody like yeah, that's a big JJ Reddick fans will try to shoot like JJ Redick or you know, if I was in a slump I try to mimic somebody else. Did you mimic someone did you come up with something that just made you comfortable? How did you kind of develop their routine if you if you look if you know focusing on looks at what I do laying back and down sort of rock into it and I get that from a bar on but you know, he does it and you know, it was just  One day I was just doing it. I just noticed I started making free throws my balance was you know my balance which is good. So, you know, I would say I got different film and there's definitely Heaven. Are you a LeBron guys that like your guy I mean, I know you guys idolized a lot of different players, but who's your guy are you like LeBron guy Kobe? Come on Kobe. Yeah. That's right. You're like most everything pretty much every game. I'm wearing Kobe's and I broke actually a pair of broke last night the first pair I was wearing the first half ended up breaking so I had to change them at halftime. When did you become a Lakers fan? Is that something that started when you were young?  Yeah me and my dad's is always a Lakers fan, you know ever since I was young. So I was always just have Kobe jerseys and stuff like that. What's like your first Kobe memory? Like the first game was like the 81-point came out on how you older. You know, I think it was the game. It was the game where they want where they want the championship against Boston and then I end up I had a mean Kobe. I think my ninth grade year the summer. So yeah, that was pretty much that was pretty much the real quick. What do you like about him? Because there's a lot of guys your age that that Kobe's almost like old school for them.  Really for me because he's Jordan feels old-school to me, but there's so many guys your age that are LeBron guys, or whoever, but what about Kobe appeal to you others like his mentality, you know, he's obviously a great score, but he's a great competitor and everything he does so, you know, just like his mentality and just how used to take over games and stuff like that. So how cool was it for you to play in Staples Center and not only play in Staples Center, but you had a really good game at Staples Center. What was what was that day? Like take me into the locker room. Did you guys like see I know it's a big facility, but did you see you?  A core stuff. Was it kind of like a cool moment for you? Yeah, actually when I when we walked in you can see like all the Lakers pictures Kobe pictures and stuff and we were actually in the we were actually in the locker room and Lakers locker room. So I stink I said Anthony Davis locker and Charles Mann and sit right next to me a little bronze like this. He's the bar fan. So, you know that was pretty surreal and it's walking out you look up and you see you know, the 8/8 no, h8, Jersey and the 24 jersey retired. So it was pretty it was pretty it was pretty crazy. And then the play as well as you did. I think they should  Brother a couple of times and chords that he was fired up on a you were you were fired up. You didn't get the win and that's that's something that I'm sure you've learned from as a game you could have won but it's to have a good game and they're to play in there. What was that experience like the game experience itself? I was crazy, you know, obviously it was a great game. It was just a competitive game and you know, we definitely learned from it, you know, you know watching film the next day and we just learned from my mistakes, but it was just all right. I was just a great great experience just to play on statement, of course. Oh, so in addition to the 50 free throws or the  25 free throws a 9 out of 10 you just work with ties after every practice, right? What are you working on with Tasman? And how awesome is that to have a guy that you look around? This building is his numbers his stats are every one of the greatest players notice you history to have him as a resource where y'all working on and just how cool is that we work on just finished the through contact, you know, we we do five shots on the Block five scotches driving a left down the same, you know just five shots on the other blogging is driving right down the seam so, you know, it's definitely like he's all he has a pan and stick so I got to finish the street.  Say and yesterday the first and one that was just a representation of what I do every day with him after practice. So I'll definitely say it's paying off and just great working with him. So what's next for you in terms of your individual development? You've got the free throws down. It seems like I know you want to build on that. You've been rebounding. Well, you've been scoring. Well, what do you want to order? Your focus is on your game right now where you trying to prove just being mentally like then, you know before SEC play started me and Causeway just talked about, you know, that was the biggest thing that unites us with a child.  Me to do just be mentally locked in and I'm just dialing, you know, it's hard as I can for every game just before every game and just my mental preparation. I would say there's my biggest thing and just try to stay consistent from a team perspective. He walked into a program that one sec championship last year guys are off to a no start. You've had a taste of SEC play. Now, where does the team need to go from here? I know you lost. Some games are not conference. The I want back. What's the next step for you guys as a team just coming here, you know just coming here. Don't get complacent. You know, I would say just starting out too.  Those who graced our and you know, obviously got a lot of got a lot of more games, you know left the place. So I was just saying you're just a consistent stay hungry and you know, just don't get complacent. All right last one for you. This is a off-topic question. I call it my Caleb question because he makes me ask everybody Give Me Your Space Jam team. I want you to build me your dream team. You're on the team. Okay, you got to surround yourself with four NBA players. All right dizzy. Yeah, you're on the team and you got four teammates NBA players you can anybody.  E from past present whatever you want build your dream team built around you and you guys got to play for the the fate of the world point guard. I'm going I'm going to Michael Jordan. It's you going I'm going Kobe and small forward. I'm going to me a power forward. I'm going to Kevin Durant and instead I'm going to say that's a pretty good team. I like your finishing with Shaq with Ellis you guys. All right turn appreciate your time.

spotify:episode:1QOhuDRITc31SeemiqoibR	  Hello and welcome to a special edition of the top of the D podcast. I'm Ross bone also known as the top of D and with the Olympic qualifying playoffs getting underway this past weekend. I decided to leave the domestic games to one side and we focusing on the road to Tokyo. So here's what's coming up next stop Tokyo for Australia China and Spain after they held their nerves in the women's Olympic.  Fires as pain in Spain for France as their dreams are crushed by the red sticks. The Netherlands are on their way to Tokyo. But Irish Hearts were broken by a video nasty. I'll take a look ahead at Great Britain's matches with Malaysia for the men's qualifiers and chilies for the women's there's all this and plenty more coming up. So without further Ado let's get crackin.  But of course before we get into all that it's time for this week's Who Am I quiz if you haven't listened before it's nice and easy, I give you three Clues over the course of the show. You have to guess who the mystery hockey player is here's the first clue. I was born on the 28th of October 1980.  Or in Hamburg Germany and I've spent all bomber one season of my club career playing from my home club, uh see that clue again. I was born on the 28th of October 1984 in Hamburg Germany, and I've spent all bar one season of my club career playing from my home club, uh, see any ideas might be an easy one for some might be difficult for others. Anyway, if you haven't got that dough,  don't worry. There's another clue coming up very shortly.  So here we go. Then the 10 days that will make or break. The Olympic dreams of hockey's top athletes has begun. The FH is Olympic qualifying playoffs came roaring into action with some fantastic hockey some interesting score lines. And at least one huge talking point. I've seen some people on social media question in the system for qualifying saying there's too much riding on two games in  A short space of time I've seen some people say there should be full on tourneys involving more than the two teams in each game. I can see that point of view and before the games got underway. I assumed that with such high stakes with zkg games where the higher-ranked side eventually prevailed give them the evidence of the first weekend of matches. I was definitely wrong about the kg side of things. So what I'll do is I'll give you a quick rundown of what's happened in the match.  Has so far and then pick up a couple of points that I want to address in a little more detail.   So first up a look at the women's Olympic qualifiers, Australia have booked their tickets Tokyo after seeing off Russia in their two game playoff in Perth again won the hockey Reus scored twice in the first two minutes A Dream start. Thanks to goals from Emily choker and Amy Lawton and although Russia pulled one back in the first quarter and then leveled through Alina. Klimova Grace Stewart's goal and another from choker put  Also using control going into game to game two is bit more routine. The Australians scored a double through Mariah Williams, and then another one each for Chalker and Stewart and a goal for Sophie Taylor secure Australia's slot in the Tokyo games elsewhere Adrian locks Spain project continues rolling on as they saw of Korea to ensure they qualify for the Olympics once again, they did.  All behind to a penalty corner from he Sun Yang in game one the lovely poachers effort from Berlin Iglesias a well-taken penalty corner from Lola riera gave them a slender Advantage going into game two in game two. Begonia Garcia settled any Spanish nurse. There may have been with the opening goal after the goalkeeper and Defender gotten a terrible mess on the goal line and then riera slotted in a penalty stroke and it was all over for Korea and  a Tokyo for Spain  the final tithe take place in the women's qualifiers. This weekend was China vs. Belgium was looking good for Belgium. After game one, where an early goal from Dual bun and a late goal from Stephanie Vandenberg a the matter to nil lead going into game two. Everything seemed to be fine for Belgium in game two. The lead was intact until four minutes from time when Bing vangu slotted home from the penalty spot to give China a glimmer of hope then  Credibly my you liang's cross was diverted into her own net by Alex Gurney here to make that to take the match into a shootout as one all after five each which took it into Southern death and then jike wheelies scored meaning Alex Gurney has her of the own goal in normal time. She had to score to keep Belgium minute her effort went wide and China took the win and a place in the Olympics and the advertising hoarding behind the goal.  Cole took a bit of a battering from the Belgium strike a stick massive for China but absolute heartbreak for Belgium, but very exciting for us watching at home. So the qualifies for the women's Olympic competition so far are as follows, Japan Argentina, Australia China Netherlands, New Zealand South Africa and Spain there are still four places up for grabs and we'll find out who takes those.  This coming weekend.    So it's now time for the second clue in today's Who Am I quiz? So here we go. Second clue is in a glittering career. I have won two Olympic gold medals and Olympic bronze medal and a World Cup. I've also won the Euro hockey league three times that clear again in a glittering career.  I've won two Olympic gold medals and Olympic bronze medal and a World Cup. I've also won the Euro hockey league three times to any idea who that is. Don't worry. If you don't know there is another clue coming up before the end of the show, right? Then here we go time to have a look at the three ties that took place over the weekend in the men's Olympic qualifiers.  I'll rattle through the first two and save the one that everyone is talking about until last so Spain join their women's side in booking a place at Tokyo after they saw off a very strong Challenge from European Rivals France the first match of this time as an absolute belter France raced into a three nil lead thanks to goals from Victor Charles A Gaspar baumgarten and Al Murray Bellinger and after 29 minutes.  I was 3-nil up must have been absolutely Overjoyed with that start even though Spain pulled one back through from a Chevy learner penalty stroke France were in an extremely strong position in the 41st and 50th minutes though as a soft and been the case for Spain over the years Power Commander stepped up slotted into penalty corners and made it 3-3 going into the deciding game in game two baumgarten de France the leave with a nap.  Solutely brilliant goal, he drove the Baseline and lifted it over the goalkeeper from close range Miguel delos and Alvaro Iglesias put Spain ahead. But Francois GUI leveled it up at five five overall in the 39th minute, but parity lasted just one minute as Chevy Leonor. Once again put Spain back in from France for everything at them. But in the end it was the red sticks who held on and it's them who will be going to Tokyo.  Fantastic two games and even though Spain took the place and even though it will be very little consolation to France. They showed once again that they're getting closer and closer to Europe's top sides all the time. You remember no doubt that they reached the quarter finals of the World Cup something that I predicted on galvanized have keys prediction show of course, and if they can keep building on those sorts of performances like this, they'll be competing on an even footing with the best sides around.  He soon Netherlands vs. Pakistan was a very entertaining tie first match finish for for Pakistan executing their penalty Corners brilliantly to Spring what can only be described as a surprise result at the end of the day end of the game at the Dutch probably looked at mink vanderveer Dan's last minute goal that made it for four and thought they probably got away with one a bit there a second game the Dutch class Jean through vanderveer and scored two.  More and there are further calls from Beyond Kellerman Mirko preiser Terrence Peters. And you Hanson. They only let it to give the Dutch a 6-1 win. If you haven't seen the highlights, I'd strongly urge you to watch them on the FH Facebook page the atmosphere inside. The stadium is superb the penalty Corner Clinic Pakistan conducted in the first game is well worth a look and Beyond Kellerman's goal in the second game is a thing of beauty like really well worth the watch.  Now then deep breath Canada versus Ireland before I go into this. I should make clear. I hate it when people criticize umpires. I hate it when people blame the outcomes the game on the officials have the utmost respect for umpires and officials. I understand it is a very difficult job. And without them there won't be a game. I accept all that and ordinarily I'd steer well clear of any top.  Make the calls out officials because I think it sends the wrong message. And I don't think it's the right road to go down. But the second match of this too much playoff ended up being decided by an Umpire in decision a video empowering decision and I'm afraid that can't be ignored. That is the major talking point of the of the contest. So here we go for context Ireland won the first match 5 3 over 2 one down in the second match.  ouch, and that meant overall they were six five up and heading to the Olympics seconds left on the clock leak whole attempted to tackle Canada's James Wallace in the circle Wallace went down the on field umpire signaled a 16 and blue the full time whistle Canada asked for a video referral the video on pyre decided the decision was a penalty stroke Scott Tucker scored to make it six six and the  Went on to win the shootout and qualify for the Olympics instead of Ireland firstly. I've seen some comments on Twitter saying the final whistle had gone. So Canada should not have been allowed to refer that's not correct. The incident happened whilst the game was still going on. They immediately asked for the referral it's as far as the rules go, they were quite within their rights to do. So, so that's that dealt with no issue on that.  I've seen some dissenting voices some posts on social media claiming corruption accusations of bias questioning the Integrity of the F IH the officials Etc. I don't agree with that at all. I think I think that's proper tinfoil hat territory. It's not a conspiracy or anything like that. But what I would say is the if I just go to describe.  Incident itself and the Fallout and they're sort of where I am on that and then you can guess make up your own minds from there. Obviously appreciate a podcast is not a visual medium so that you to visit the BBC sport website and watch the incident for yourself, but essentially the attacker drives towards the Baseline the crowded Circle The Defender tries to reach to make a tackle the attacker appears to step on the defender stick causing him to fall as I said earlier the on  on field umpire signals are 16 and blows for full-time and Ireland think they've done it.  the rules on a penalty stroke State that's a penalty stroke is awarded for an offense by a defender in the circle which prevents the probable scoring of a goal or for an intentional offense in the circle by Defender against an opponent Who has possession of the ball or an opportunity to play The Boom  Now as I see it for point a I think from the angle the attackers going the speed is going the area of the circle. He's in the number of Defenders and goalkeeper around deeming that to be a probable goalscoring opportunity as a bit of a stretch. Obviously, it's my opinion. It's open to debate and criticism and there are people far better qualified than me to sort of make judgments on that. But my feeling is it would take something extremely special to  Go from there, and I don't deem that to be a probable goalscoring opportunity point B and intentional offense in the circle by Defender against an opponent Who has possession of the ball and opportunity to play the boom to me. That's an attempted flatstick tackle. The defender only has eyes for the bull he's intent on making a tackle to win the ball cleanly and the contact with the attackers foot is as much down to the attackers movement.  As it is to The Defenders movement. I'd say a penalty Corner would maybe be a fair decision. But to deem that to be an intentional foul is again my opinion a massive reach for me and I don't believe that that's the correct outcome. If you don't believe me just find out what island Captain Jonathan Bell thinks of it. Here's his post match interview.  Terrible decision in the last moments of the game is much stronger out us today to pretty even gear and we chances their chances and we did have a couple chances take the game away from them. But as I say I decision I got this level is just not acceptable. Thank you.    So no pull no punches pulled their one of the shortest that most matter-of-fact post-match interviews. You're ever likely to hear to be honest given how he was probably feeling he's been quite restrained there in my opinion as I've seen a lot of content comments across social media and a lot of rooted in emotion and anger a lot of people, you know jumping to conclusions throwing wild accusations around I've tried  Kind of cut through the noise and pull out a couple of salient points for discussion in an attempt to work out what's happened and try and get some sort of understanding. The first thing that I did find of interest is that there was some question marks over the technology and the video angles available to the video on pyre Stephen finned later of hook hockey. He tweeted during the early stages the first game TV production having a hole  a world of issues with showing the replays but video and by has no advice possible. So PC stands a big worry about the quality of video angles on offer that was at Neil Neil in the early stages of the first match of the too much Series so long before the key decision in team in game two. I've not seen anything from the FH about the video on pyre facilities or the angles available the feed I watched was not the best. It's pretty  Court follow the angle shown on the replay whilst the umpires making the decision weren't that great either maybe the video on pie had access to angles and footage that we watching at home didn't I don't know. What I do know is that that tweet from Stevens suggests that there are concerns early on about the sort of the angles available to them and what I would also say if the video on Pearl was using the same video I could see  it's hard to see how they could have been expected to make clear and fair decisions based on the footage available. So as we know there appeared to be some concerns and a few issues at the video in the first game and I know a number of journalists have put in requests the FH for clarification of what angles were available. You do kind of worried about that. It's part of a wider point with hockey that the quality of the video referral facilities seems to differ wildly from venue to venue and tournaments, too.  Moments is not doing the game any favors when the impression is that some matches and some venues the video employers cannot do their jobs to the standards. We expect to firm because I don't have the correct the correct equipment or facilities to do. So for a game of this importance. I find it very difficult to comprehend the situation could arise where a video on prayer is not able to see every angle to make the correct decision that being said  and obviously that is just me speculating because I don't know and I know checking just before recording. None of the journalists have heard back about what video angles were available. Of course, there is the possibility that the video and I did have access to angles that we at home did not see but if that's the case, why don't you FH come out and say this it might not quite and down the baying mob with their pitchforks and their flaming  Which is barred and I think it might it might help clarify things a little bit. I have seen a number of people say the FH should come out and explain the decision and how it has arrived at and I know BBC sport contacted them for a statement, but we're told umpires decisions are final and as a general principle FH does not comment publicly on individual umpiring decisions. So obviously we've seen in the Rugby World Cup the world rugby governing body came out and  Jesus some decisions made a Believe In The Island V Japan match, so I don't see why the F IH can't do the same. Now. I appreciate that. We people screaming at their device. Now who disagree with this saying that's a dangerous precedent to set you don't want to get into a situation where every time someone disagrees with an umpire's decision. They expect an official explanation and that is a slippery slope that we don't want to get down a stage where we're doing that forever.  You came but what I would say is this is an exceptional circumstance. It's not just another decision in just another game Ireland's and Canada's place at the Olympic Games The Pinnacle of the sport depended on the outcome of this decision. Not just that but funding sponsorship livelihoods careers by any metric. This was a huge decision with a lot riding on it if the FHA saying the video and pie made the  At call, which personally I don't believe he did. Why don't they come out and explain that why don't they come out and back that don't Ireland deserve that don't Canada deserve to have the sheen restored to their achievement of reaching the Olympics.  As I say I just think there's a lot of unanswered questions out there. There's a lot of angry people out there. It isn't a usual situation. It is an exceptional circumstance and I think it would be very worthwhile for the FH to try and clear this up. I'm not sure if any of this section makes sense to be honest. My thinking is a bit jumbled around the whole thing. I feel desperately sorry for Canada because I feel like  their joy and their achievement of reaching the Olympics has been tainted by this controversy and I feel even more sorry for Ireland because losing in that fashion is is horrendous to put it mildly and perhaps the last word on the matter just for some food for thought is a tweet from Davy heart. One of the islands goalkeepers hockey careers ended Olympic dream shattered and years and years of nothing but hard work and dedication from all players.  Finished honestly still can't believe what happened a decision that will carry pain for a lifetime heartbroken. There you go.   Well, that was that was quite heavy after all that let's lighten the mood with the final clue in The Who Am I quiz here we go final third and final clue. I made over 250 appearances for Germany and scored over a hundred goals and was voted F. IH World Player of the Year.  2012 clue again, I made over 250 appearances for Germany scored over a hundred goals and was voted F IH World Player of the Year in 2012 and the ideas fear not if you haven't got it, although I think that would have clinched it for many people, but the answer is coming up very shortly.  So we've looked at the Olympic qualifiers which have happened. And now there's the small matter of the ones coming up. This coming week ends at the Lee Valley Hockey and Tennis Centre in London Great. Britain will do battle with chili in the women's competition and with Malaysia in the man's an Olympic Games birth is on the line. So let's have a look at what we can expect. So the teams they face first up quick. Look at chili.  He will represent a new challenge for Mark Hagar side. The two teams have never met in a major tournament. Chili A ranked 18th in the world finished fourth at the recent Pan American games where they lost to Argentina in the semi-finals and then lost the bronze medal match to the USA of a player called Manuela Roth who has played Club hockey in Belgium for Royal Antwerp and more recently in the Netherlands for on your road.  She is probably their biggest goal threats called 13 International goals in 2019. I think including seven penalty Corners, so she will be a big threat. She has a lot of experience International level and of European hockey from people. I've spoken to who know a lot more about these things for me. I've been told chili style is and a bit like a sort of Argentina light. So last year I blast will be physical hard-working have an aggressive press plenty of  The visual Flair and I'm sure give Great Britain a run for their money. What can we expect from the host? Perhaps Captain Holly pan web can shed some light on the situation. I caught up with her last week and here's how she sees it going.  It's been a tough few months with the pro league in the Euros not going maybe the way you would have wanted. But how are you guys sort of feeling going into these Olympic qualifiers? I think it's really important to look at the bigger picture in terms of sort of what's happened in the last year in terms of absolute losing our through injury and and and I've seen it through injury and and having some players like shown a comeback and so a lot of our senior players and then obviously changing coaching staff. So I think yeah, it has been like a  Yes so far, but if you look at the bigger picture terms of what's happened. It's very much a sort of big new average new Young Squad new team and obviously the new head coach in place. So I think it was just inevitable. It was going to take a bit of time for his daughter to jail. So I don't think it's looking back in and sort of panic stations. I think it's that works, even though it didn't go to exactly how you wanted it. That stuff is still benefited Us in the long run in terms of getting to know each other so  I think going into the mitt qualifiers. I think yeah would confident going into it. I don't think we can be overly confident. I don't think we can underestimate chili. I've certainly never played them. I think most people are team heaven and they're not going to be an easy to use not give me a walkover. We know it's going to be tough. But you know, we're here we've got these six weeks preparing for it. We've got these great test matches against India who are very good side and I think the wind today against India organic. It was a lot of confidence sort of  Had periods in that game already sort of have to dig really deep and defend and I'm sort of Road through that way, which I think's a massive learning on what we have in the product because in the parolee, we actually played some good hockey and patches. We just defensively were just sort of letting in goals. So I think now we if we can sort of settle a defensive it more keep that really strong and still have the attacking hockey that we sort of begin to sort of generate a through pro league then I think we can have a really good balance.  It's and yeah, it gives us really good confidence. So it's fair to say that you kind of although it's been tough. You have kind of progress and you've come on. Yeah, I think it's just about building and learning and learning from those experiences. And that's the best way especially for our youngsters and lesson experience play it I think that's the best way for them to learn and so that's a really big benefit of as having your prodi's we have so many really highly competitive games that hope was hopefully status in really good Stead.  These two matches against Chile in there are some players in the squad that experience like the 2014 World Cup. Yeah, which obviously isn't great and but then, you know a year later European Champions, you're after that Olympic Champions. I mean to those experiences kind of help you to sort of kind of say to the younger players that good times can be Round the Corner that makes sense. Really? I think it's important to say it doesn't matter where we are now if  We all believe we can achieve something in a year's time definitely can achieve it for your stick to processes because there's a some of us in this room that have witnessed that and been through that and it has been done even though people on the outside might write you off I did before Rio as long as we as a group believer and a working towards that then anything can can happen. So I definitely think that gives you some confidence in the back of your head and it's important to give that message to youngsters. However, it's also important to  You to say to them. It just doesn't just happen. So there has got to be changed over that period and he we do have to look at what we need to improve and we have to work really hard in training and training has to replicate our games. So it doesn't just happen. We have to work really hard and through that process. It will be tough. But if we all do that together, then we can achieve what we want to achieve the end of it. And if you've not played against Chile yourself, but what do you know what to be expecting from them when you play them I think watching obviously we've watched.  Some of them and they look very in terms of how the Argentinian sort of style of play so and seeing some of the results from their some the world league. They won't be tough. They beat Japan fit three one and had a really good game there. So I don't think we can underestimate them. I think they've got some skillful and quick players and we're going to be careful of them on the brake and they will be tough to break down and I think we've got to expect that. It won't be a game where we sort of is a walk in the park.  Is complying score line, we will have to work through all of it for the whole 60 minutes and the next game as well. I mean these these games are obviously absolutely massive, you know, arguably the biggest since the Rio fine. I mean, how do you kind of cope with the pressure of now do you go into those games and make sure you perform your best. I think it's just exactly same as how we approach the Olympics and the Really final it's just a matter of you've got these processes in place and if we do the  processes and follow them step by step and don't look too far ahead in you're just focusing on the here and now or what we have to do right in this moment. Then when we get to that point, you will feel as prepared as you possibly can both individually and as a squad so that when we gets that moment, there isn't the pressure because we know we're in a really really good place and that's what we did go to Rio and that's what we did in the final and and and that's what we're trying to accomplish right now is is the training we're doing in these test matches and that is look who's up and all the preparation we  Both in the meeting rooms and on the pitch that's just part of the processes that hopefully again enable us when we get to the second or third November is to win those games against Chile. So confident you can get it done. Yes. Yep. Excellent. That's what I wanted. Yeah. Awesome.     So the clear message from the captain is one of quiet confidence. You definitely get the impression. She's not taking anything for granted. She's not under estimating the opposition but there is a tone of determination in her voice there and it feels like Holly Pern web will be ready as she always is whenever she steps out onto the pitch one of the players who could be Central to Great Britain's chances. This coming weekend will be Giselle Ansley.  She's come to the fore as their Premier drag Flicker and I've spoken to her about the chili games about her role as the set piece specialist and a few more things besides that so here's what she had to say.  A big couple of games coming up. So how's the mood in the in the group at the moment? Yeah, absolutely massive games coming up and I think the kind of the group just wants to kind of get there and play it and kind of get it done. So we're looking forward to it. There's definitely a sense of anticipation. That's for sure that we using kind of the weeks that we've got to you know, train really hard and make sure they'll make sure that we're as prepared as possible really and then  Been working with Mark Hagar for a for a little while. Now you previously worked with Danny for what seemed like a really long time. I mean, how are you finding kind of the differences and what sort of things have you picked up from Mark? Yeah, I think Mark definitely brings that real attacking style pay that he wants that he wants us to implement and I think occasionally as a group we've taken out a little bit too far in terms of we've kind of gone all gung-ho and left us.  Cells open to their counter-attack, but you know, he was writ Mark was really Keen to build on the defensive processes and principles that we had under Danny. He definitely admired them a lot and then he felt that he could bring in that attacking side of the game, which is you know, what we were really kind of looking for. So yeah for us, it's remembering what we learn under Danny in terms of all of the as I say the defensive structure and stuff and making sure that we don't go away.  Fanatics I feel we definitely have periods of the last couple of months, but definitely now we're you know, we're starting to ensure that we keep that side of our game as well as try and develop that attacking attacking side of it. And yeah, he obviously gets really excited especially being a big goal scorer himself and his time. So, yeah, the the technical aspects of goalscoring as well have been brought into our training sessions a lot more which is really really good for us knowing that the pro league was a  Obviously quite tough for you guys, perhaps didn't go as you would have hoped but I mean what sort of lessons have you taken out alarm what sort of things have you kind of what positives can you draw from you? Yeah, definitely the product we had our fair share of mixed results to be honest. We had some good performances, but didn't get the results. We had some okay results.  not good performances that kind of thing and we also had a lot of people making debuts or first, you know, GB cat that kind of stuff and it was all you know very much trying to piece the jigsaw back together, I guess and yeah, we obviously with the change in Personnel a lot in terms of also having Mark come into in to coach us, I think  We kind of took a long time to jail again and it was it was hard definitely and you know, I think I've been incredibly fortunate in my career that I've been a part of something incredibly strong teams, and I can't say that I've ever been a part of a team that had been on a run of losses and stuff like that which I mean it sounds ridiculous to say because I've been incredibly fortunate in in my career.  Here. So, yeah, it was about us kind of picking myself up from that and accepting that you have to go through those periods in order to make the greatest gains again. So we learned a lot through that you know that you can't just expect things to happen. You can't just expect results to come to you. You have to make it happen. You have to play an entire 60 minutes and you know, it was also good for girls to get you know, that haven't really experienced and that much international hockey to get a flavor of hockey.  I know what it's like at that top level every single week and that was something that none of us that are doing, you know, making sure that you play one week you've kind of got a debrief that but you've also then go to prepare for another game and the following week traveling on the road things like that. You know all was a huge learning curve for all of us and one that will definitely stand Us in good stead moving forwards or it's all about performing those one-off games. So hopefully, you know for us that's really good looking so qualifier.  I gave us to lie, it will all be about, you know, winning that first game and then obviously on to the second game at straight after that. So yeah, there was a lot of learning for us and it was an incredible experience. And now we've seen you sort of stepping up its kind of the main penalty Corner Flickr for the soy does does that responsibility add some pressure to you or is that something that you've relish? Yeah, I definitely I'm not gonna lie at times you did.  Definitely feel the pressure but you know as now a senior player and you know worked worked hard on it and but penalty Corner defenses are getting better goalkeepers are getting better. They'll try to beat Maddie. Yeah. So yeah, I definitely do feel responsibility. But I also think that with that's what comes with the nature of  You know being a flicker or whatever off the top of the stuff the top and I do honest I quite liked it. I liked responsibility. There's something I've definitely thrived on and yeah come to the come to game time. I want I want to be called to flick, you know, that's that's what I want. So for me, yeah, if we were in a corner, I'm happy to step up there and take that kind of on my shoulders must feel good.  And it run into the top corner and The Crowd Goes Nuts that must make it worthwhile. Yeah, absolutely. Definitely when it when it comes off and it you know, it hits the hits the back of the back of the net and you can celebrate. I think my celebrations kind of show how relieved I am that is a gun in but yeah, I know that definitely makes it worthwhile and with the chili games coming up he could argue there that be his Sky.  Seems you guys have played since maybe the Rio final. So how do you sort of go into that and sort of, you know, try and prepare for such a big guy? Yeah, but by far they are the biggest games because obviously we had the Europeans and and they were a chance to qualify as well. But as soon as that chance is gone, this is your final chance essentially if we you know, you win this you're going to see them picks you losing your not  If you think that like that then yeah probably the most pressure game that will ever play in the quit. It's an incredible opportunity. You know, we absolutely cannot underestimate chili. I myself have actually never played against some senior or Junior and technology in fact, so that is a new experience in itself. And but we've obviously got a lot of video.  Oh and stuff on them. So we'll be absolutely 110 percent prepared for that game. And yes another chance to go out there and we're GB shirt and you know fight for this team and hockey in this country to have a another shot at an Olympic Games. It's pretty   So plenty of insight into the mood in the Great Britain women's Camp ahead of their crunch tie with chili this coming weekend Great. Britain's men's team are also in action this coming weekend. They will face Malaysia in their Olympic qualifying play-off. I'd like to give you some interviews from the Great Britain men's Camp. However at the time of recording Great Britain Aki's media team have not yet.  Out me the chance to speak to anyone from the men's side of things. So at the moment I'll have to make do some quotes from Danny carry from when the draw was made instead that he said Malaysia are a good side with some great individuals and a number of threats that having played them recently. It gives you that understanding of what that threat is.  They have some good Corner routines and some very fast players who are individually skillful and they also have some very large aerial passes play. Well on the counter-attack and with a very experienced coach you enroll in Altman's will be very well prepared. We will respect them and prepare accordingly playing at Lee Valley Hockey and Tennis Center and having a home crowd is something I personally enjoy and I feel the athletes enjoy having the support behind us, too.  It's a great atmosphere there and I think you'll be a cracking couple of days that myself and the athletes will really look forward to not ideal having me read that help but, you know make the best of the situation we've got any way. That's Danny carry touched upon in those quotes there Roland Altman's is the coach of the Malaysian side. He is a coach par Excellence. The Wily Dutchman is adept at preparing his size to be disciplined stick to their plan.  Lan but he's very good at marrying that discipline with Malaysia sort of natural Flair and that's why there will be a handful for Great Britain and it didn't outstanding job as coach of India. Where as I say instill that discipline alongside the natural Flair and free-flowing ability of the side made them a really tough Prospect and them, you know, it's had a bit more time with Malaysia. I think the World Cup came a bit too soon for them.  Because he'd only been in the job a short time. He's been there for a little while now. So, you know his his ideas and his tactics will be taking group have some absolutely wonderful players Malaysia fits all sorry Faisal. Sorry Razzie Raheem 10 Cooter Juden. They all have an absolute abundance of international experience loads of flair. The corner routines are excellent, and they're attacking threat is  You know very very good. They will be no soft-touch whatsoever. I also have one of my favorite goalkeepers Kumar not the biggest and that 39 not the youngest very unorthodox, but fantastic to watch always a joy to see him play and he always looks like he's really enjoying himself as well. So I always look forward to seeing him turn out that being said. I hope he doesn't play that well because I want Great Britain to qualify.  From a Great Britain standpoint Squad it looks as though Wales is Jacob Draper will be in the squad for his third Great Britain cap after he impressed in the European championships for his home nation won't be his debut for GB but it's third cap. I think which is quite the occasion to be winning it such an important weekend. I'm really Keen to see him rise to the occasion. And I'm sure he will is a very talented young player and Liam Sanford appears to be back in contention.  The squad after a long injury lay-off his bravery and direct running in the Dan Fox role at penalty Corner defense could prove to be extremely useful. Especially given Malaysia's Potential Threat from set pieces. Other than that Zach Wallace and Phil Ropers creative spark will be one of the keys to unlocking the vistas defense and with Sam Ward up top. You've always got a chance obviously taking nothing to grow up for granted, but Woody no,  Where the goal is has a very good girls to games ratio in international hockey and you can usually Bank on him to come up trumps for you. And I'm sure he'll be chomping at the bit to get out there. So yeah, nothing taken for granted. But personally, I don't normally do predictions, but I'm predicting that Great Britain will get the job done and I certainly hope that I am right on that front.  Now it's time for the moment.
