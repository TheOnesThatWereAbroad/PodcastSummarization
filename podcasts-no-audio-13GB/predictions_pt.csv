The pros certainly outweigh the cons, and the biggest problem I had was that the game was too addicting, which is actually a good job done by the creators.

"Dollar house or a $200,000 house.
If you have to spend $20,000 on rewiring the house or replacing the roof, you're probably not going to do it.
The gross Guild on a prop on the Auckland property is 4.5 1% the gross yield on their althom property or small town property is 8.3 to pee.","In this episode, we discuss another difference between investing in small towns and larger cities – deferred capital maintenance.
Every investor accepts (and hopefully budgets for) the fact that their properties will require maintenance throughout the year.
However, we also know that from time to time investment properties will require capital maintenance, especially if the property is older.
This could be the replacement of a roof, painting the outside of the property, rewiring the house, or some other major works.
These are often not budgeted for and the payment for these works are often made by leveraging the property.
But, the cost of this maintenance is more expensive (as a proportion of the house price) for properties in smaller towns than in large cities.
That means that a small-town property that appears to be cashflow positive can actually have a poor cashflow once this capital maintenance is factored in.
We also mention the Property Investors Quiz, this 7-question quiz will give you a 'yes', 'no', or'maybe', answer as to whether you are in a position to invest in property right now."

Born in South Florida with a post-graduate degree at Yale (where he was also an instructor before moving to Philly to work at Temple), Gibson's work is so perfectly stated by M+B Gallery: Gibson's painting ""stems from his multipartite viewpoint as an artist—as a black male, a professor, an American history buff and comic book aficionado.""
On the occasion of our series at The Armory Show in NYC, Radio Juxtapoz sat down with Mark Thomas Gibson on an early morning before the fair doors opened to talk about his solo booth with M+B, the changing dynamics of not only his work but the overall landscape of contemporary art and how the comic book was his first love.

If you are in the grips of a ranging anxiety disorder - finding it near impossible to STOP thinking about how you feel all the time - it's OK to reject this advice.
While in the grips of raging disorders like OCD, health anxiety, panic disorder, and agoraphobia, specifically making time to focus inward on how one is feeling is like pouring gasoline on a fire.

War you venture out the more you try the less fear you have.","Learned helplessness is a condition where a person suffers from a sense of feeling powerless.
It usually comes from a traumatic event or series of traumatic events or persistent failure to succeed.
It's one of the biggest underlying causes of depression.
When you grow up with abuse and trauma, you learn helplessness, and it becomes an identity for you, its the equivalent to being locked in an emotional prison cell.
When you grow up, and you move out on your own, nobody is guarding you, the cell door is not locked, and you can walk out at any time, but you can't do it.
You have been conditioned to be helpless.
We've become unwilling to walk away from the pain.
We accept it as our reality.

Most of us believe that forgiveness is an outward act that requires you to be okay with what the other person did to you.
We argue that this is just not the case.
Forgiveness is an internal shift in awareness and energy within yourself.
It’s the ability to shift the story you tell yourself about the other person, and your relationship to the event.
In this episode we discuss:   How forgiveness work is a constant process, not something you do once.
Victim mindset, and how it keeps a lot of us stuck in resentment and an unwillingness to forgive.
How an unwillingness to forgive and hold grudges is actually harming YOU, not the other person.
How taking responsibility for your forgiveness work will increase your sense of agency over your life.
Two life coaches expert tips on how you can begin to forgive even those who have hurt you the most, and why this is so important to your overall health and well-being.

Later, Stephanie’s son would also be diagnosed with autism.
During all of this, Stephanie’s husband found out he had a life threatening heart condition and would eventually need a transplant.
After her daughter was diagnosed, Stephanie started a private instagram account- it was just for her to document her complicated feelings and grief during this time.
Eventually, Stephanie took the brave step to make that account public.
Today, she not only has that account but also her blog, ‘Tinkles her Pants’ (best name ever!)
where she “leaks” the truth.

"The Transfiguration is quite unique even different from his other Miracles as well.
Peter likely has in mind the tents used for the Feast of Tabernacles the Autumn Harvest Festival in which the Israelites dwelt in makeshift tents for seven days commemorating God's presence.","Matthew 17: 1-9 - 'His face shone like the sun.'
CCC Passages: - 554 (in 'A Foretaste of the Kingdom - The Transfiguration') - From the day Peter confessed that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God, the Master ""began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things... and be killed, and on the third day be raised.""
Peter scorns this prediction, nor do the others understand it any better than he.
In this context the mysterious episode of Jesus' Transfiguration takes place on a high mountain, before three witnesses chosen by himself: Peter, James and John.
Jesus' face and clothes become dazzling with light, and Moses and Elijah appear, speaking ""of his departure, which he was to accomplish at Jerusalem"".
A cloud covers him and a voice from heaven says: ""This is my Son, my Chosen; listen to him!""

CCC Passages: - 1933 (in 'Social Justice') - This same duty extends to those who think or act differently from us.
the teaching of Christ goes so far as to require the forgiveness of offenses.
He extends the commandment of love, which is that of the New Law, to all enemies.
Liberation in the spirit of the Gospel is incompatible with hatred of one's enemy as a person, but not with hatred of the evil that he does as an enemy.
- 2842 (in 'The Seven Petitions') - You, therefore, must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect""; ""Be merciful, even as your Father is merciful""...It is impossible to keep the Lord's commandment by imitating the divine model from outside; there has to be a vital participation, coming from the depths of the heart, in the holiness and the mercy and the love of our God.

"Waking youth is a weekly podcast from The Daily Discussion.
This week's host is Spanish student and third-year communication student.
The podcast is about feeling uncertain about the future and questioning what Society takes for granted.","Welcome!
Waking Life, by Richard Linklater, is a movie that tells the story of a young man who keeps realizing he’s in a dream, inside of endless other dreams, having philosophical conversations with distinct individuals about the meaning of life, consciousness, the nature of reality, etc.
One of the central questions of the movie is: How can we really know we aren’t just stuck in a perpetual dream?
How can we make sure we are waking?
This said, Waking Youth is a bi-weekly podcast that aims to inspire you and me to make sure we aren't sleepwalking through our waking state.
Assuming, of course, that the life we consider our waking life isn't merely a dream (but I will hopefully leave such discussion to a whole other episode).
I invite several young students and professionals to deconstruct how they make sure they are questioning reality, building the life of their dreams, and living up to their fullest creative potential.
