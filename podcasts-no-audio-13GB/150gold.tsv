G	But well, I remember there was a lot like that show was one of the shows that was really difficult to like just straight up route for characters because virtually everyone like had these things where it's like, okay Hank is, you know, doing good things law enforcement wise but like also seems to be kind of a shitty dude at times like you want to root for Walter White early on in the show but clearly the whole point of the show is that he progressively becomes a worse and worse person a but I still remember rooting for him at the end.

The Bench Bridge has been solid Off the Bench, you know, they've got they've got pieces to be competitive and you know, both of those struggles, especially if Aiden's suspension is upheld, you know, they have to hold down the fort without him, but, you know been really competitive, you know in just about every game to start the season Them and I think yeah, they can make a huge leap 35 40 wins, you know Monty has them again playing really good ball really impressive.

But you know, I mean, I'm sure it's Decorating no different than you know all the other movies and you know out there that you can heal sugar-coated and all these other things like wow, like you kind of go into this existential debate and I think that we just need to really look at where the studies are coming from.	G	I would almost consider it more like a you know, whole Natural Foods like we talked about the level on meats and vegetables nuts and seeds some fruit little starch and sugar and the reason why it's not you know, I don't know if I actually ever truly prescribed to the paleo diet the paleo diet, you know omission of grains Dairy and legumes and very very restrictive depending on the practitioner that you're thirstier you're learning from but the reality is whole natural foods naturally occurring absolutely having less processed and refined carbohydrates check and that really did change my life and I weighed and measured my food for about five years straight and never cheating. Other than that empty calories that it provides but it tastes Great, and it's there's there's there's nothing wrong with that other than the fact that unfortunately, it's Laden with in a lot of processed foods and it's masked and within a lot of processed foods and foods that are you know, not naturally occurring so that's something we need to be mindful of so I think that and again let's just pause there for a second to like food that's naturally occurring so like all right.

I said at 32% and then linebackers was this is the third most voted on at 28% Janelle out of those four that I mentioned you have one in mind as far as a position like to see your any players out there right now that you'd like to Packers to go.	B	I think like I guess I can see how like a contract like that can affect another one of their players and I think it might have in a way given a most like a little bit of a kick out the door kind of opened the door for him because obviously it's a business money is always a factor in it. I think he's definitely better when the man on the other side is healthy when him and Perry both healthy, they were doing really well, but then when injuries affect one of them then the other kind of Falls, so I think if you bring Matthews back for for cheap, and as long as whoever is on the other side of him is applying good pressure because the thing is like one or they have to cover one of the other like they focus more on one side and then the other kind of breaks free a little bit more and that was the thing with Matthews and Perry is they put a little bit more side on Matthews and then Mayor would get through or vice versa.	B	Like doesn't make sense now, he's that's the only thing if you bring Williams back, I don't want to see him on special teams ever again.

So, you know, it was a time where everybody was going after our Kelly and I think that there are a couple of people in the industry that kind of make a name for themselves that if you want to talk to somebody here the 10 people you want to go to and at that time being He had a greater position than they have now because white folks didn't care about black people in the news back then see now.	F	So what inspired you to do this to do this, you know conversations for me has been the thing that I kind of made my career on everybody knew me for doing interviews and I had a show called conversations with that Gordon where I did a lot of the quote-unquote famous interviews, I've done over the years and so I wanted to and as you know, you know some of Most interesting conversations you have is when the red light on the camera goes off for the microphones are turned off and then people kind of ease up and tell you what they really feel. Yeah and like will roll up on getting that was the fear and that was it that was the fear and she was frightened and and justifiably so because you know, we use language so So loosely and we assume that everybody who's listening has, you know, all of the chairs on the front porch, but that is not the case sometimes and so I think we've got to be careful and and then there is just this sense of you know again, and we talked about it quickly in the book this whole sense of respect for women in general black women specifically and though we like to talk about it up front as if everybody, you know respects and loves black women.

Like I think it could be a tuner or to 1/2 the whites because I think we all know they've had a good start being a bit better recently Darby, but I think we still got the quality to go out there and get the three.	B	But I think that we could have been three and a lot in the first 20 minutes, but we just didn't take our chances and that was what that was what when it for you not yeah, most clinical and yeah, I still think if if you did obviously got a goal in the third minute to get you guys a head if you did and you should of got a second goal even maybe three and if you did go Second goal. It's going to be very unlikely if he's instead of makes you wish but moving on to mid week against Fulham of got Darby QPR have got just again lost in the forest oh yes over two Rivals and we both got this arrivals yeah yeah and I think we're going to lose three one and your home Patrick yeah we are and I think our defense is going to make Louis grabbing look like fry Maradona but I think it could be a really insane game that one because both laugh I'm not sure about National Forest is offense but your defense is shocking no offense and I'm not sure nothing for a second quad best offense not really sure but I think I'll be a lot of goals could um I'm pretty to to actually for keep your Forest really good goalkeeper oh yeah that's true I think for that project critics and she gave me a bit of optimistic so I don't think we can win that I just I love it when there's like We can gain in the midweek games and reaching I just get so excited.	B	I think that the shots will give us a call from Fulham and I think that Kimura could be one of our knees strike and so we could put it up probably bitch bitch, but he's poor for full of a storm. Yeah, but there's loads of teams that are like joint with us has been really close to Championship.	B	QPR lost 1-0 to Fulham at Craven Cottage on Friday night. QPR should have put about seven goals away in the first 20 minutes. Road Act is the only goalkeeper we need. We've got the worst offense.

What's only the Mensa but even then I think the team defense is it's one of the whole is greater than the sum of its parts deals where even with the guys performing well on an individual level the team defense is still Level higher than that and why that's encouraging to me is I mean, it's one of the coaching clich√©s but defense travels, you know, and what you see a lot of times with these teams that rely on three-point shots like the Aztecs kind to do to a certain extent they can score inside with the best of them also, but I think when the Aztecs are at their full gear they're hitting those three point shots.

B	And so watching his defense has been truly amazing based off of what I was expecting at the very least. So Boise state has done this type of thing before they're coached by Leon rice who's a good coach.	B	Trey Pulliam has been slowly but surely improving and it's been nice to see. The team defense has been amazing and I think they're pretty much across the Spectrum like a top 10 or top 15 defense in the nation. Yanni Wetzel has been really good download there are some metrics that are even better than Nathan Mensa.

She also responds to listener feedback and questions from the One Step community. Thanks for making our first season absolutely magical! We‚Äôre already working season two, coming in early 2020 ‚Äì stay tuned! Make sure you listen to Episode 7: The Sober Life to hear about Erica's story of recovery, which inspired this episode. FOLLOW FOR MORE Follow One Step on Instagram @onesteppodcast Follow Ingrid on Instagram @ingridnilsen YouTube Ingrid Nilsen Twitter @ingridnilsen CREDITS Producer Cristina Cleveland @cristinacleveland Sound Engineer Teng Chen @tengfoodpanda Recording studio, The Wing	G	This is a topic that is really important to me and I would love to do episodes that are more specifically focused on this topic, but I think one thing that has been really cool about this first season is, you know, the things that we are talking about because I am a mixed race queer woman the things that we're talking about the perspectives I'm sharing are coming through the lens of a queer experience and I feel really proud of myself for stepping into that space and really grateful to have this space and that makes me really excited to talk to other people about their experiences like having Erica here and talking about queerness and Recovery really like lit up this part of me where I was like who I want to have like more queer conversations with people so If any of you have suggestions for guests that you would love to hear on the show, definitely let us know. he would not do and that's why it's a regret if we regret something we've obviously done a lot of learning to get to that point and for me one of the most important things in my life are my relationships with my friends and also my romantic relationship with Erica my relationship with my mom my relationships in general are really big deal to me and what I've learned over the years is that it's often the smaller moments that That you typically won't see on camera or like in an Instagram photo or like hear me talking about those are the moments that I really cherish the most and I did go through a phase, especially in my early years of just being on the internet and on YouTube where I didn't have any boundaries and I had to figure out what my boundaries were by crossing over them.	F	and typically what we're seeing is this rock bottom where a person is on the streets and they're totally alone and it looks like they have lost everything and that is a very singular image that we have been fed and not to say that that imagery isn't true and that isn't the reality for some people because it very much is is but I think when we only see a singular image of what something is it makes us think that oh, well, I'm not that so I can't possibly be going through the same thing and I tie this back to my queerness and how I always stuffed away my attraction towards women inside of me because Is I would see this very narrow image of what lesbians looked like and I thought well, I don't look like that or I don't act like that or I'm not living my life in that way like none of this is really relatable to me in any way whatsoever. This is a topic that is really important to me and I would love to do episodes that are more specifically focused on this topic, but I think one thing that has been really cool about this first season is, you know, the things that we are talking about because I am a mixed race queer woman the things that we're talking about the perspectives I'm sharing are coming through the lens of a queer experience and I feel really proud of myself for stepping into that space and really grateful to have this space and that makes me really excited to talk to other people about their experiences like having Erica here and talking about queerness and Recovery really like lit up this part of me where I was like who I want to have like more queer conversations with people so If any of you have suggestions for guests that you would love to hear on the show, definitely let us know.

But you know most of the time I do think things through and have a reason for doing something but with the Vlog it was just kind of random desire to just do it and because of that I thought well, you know, it's easy to get in.	B	It's funny because we listen to so many podcasts you kind of assume that everybody loves podcast, but it took me a while to get into them because I am also a very visual person and you used to listen to them and I'd be like now, I don't think I'd ever get into podcasts but I have not everyone listens to podcast and the Vlog is a fantastic alternative and it has the added benefits of Being able to see stuff which is very handy when you have an art business because you can show your supplies. And then there's Gypsy by sibella Court like two books that were super inspiring to me in this whole abstract landscape the path that I was following, you know to put together the abstract landscape class, like there were books and things and I like the color palette that yes pied me Tink over the 10 weeks or the sorry, the nine weeks that we filmed the Vlogs you've touched on the substrate that you use the location of the Landscapes that You're drawing your inspiration from the color palette that you use the books and the inspiration.	B	Yeah, they're brave people that's true actually because like I've done a bit of filming at local crowd the cafe where I have my work and when you've got kind of a crew or people around you it's not actually so bad, but just doing it on your own would feel better. And when we start talking about it, I was like, oh my God, three minutes per podcast wouldn't be enough.	B	Richie and Laura have been getting up at 5:30 a.m. every morning to film their Vlogs. The Vlog is kind of like a blog post in video format. It has the added benefits of being able to see stuff which is very handy when you have an art business.

But if there's a constantly nitpicking no, but what I what I wanted to see was can we go from one side of the other and score a goal, you know with like passing and going over the our opponent not just, you know, a tap-in after after hit I would like to see if we're going to do that.

They also discussed the Nate Sudfeld injury and how that impacts Cody Kessler and the overall QB picture, how personnel people view Eli Harold, and the impact of Lane Johnson's injury on team decision-making.	G	So that at some point in time this was gonna be back but now it's looking like it could be longer and even with Darby who's just now starting to practice a little bit, you know, yeah, maybe rasul Douglas starts because a he's earned it and because two guys who you have thought we're going to start aren't even going to be healthy enough to play. You're not going to do that.	B	I mean, it wouldn't ship would not surprise me if he comes back within that the fact if it really heals well, maybe throws lightly or will they let him throw because it's not Is Right risk may be the 11th start throwing a week 5 who knows but decision was made that they were in a not going to put on any reserve list is he was going to come back fairly early and that's really the reason why they're not going to sign a quarterback. Oh I and I hope as the preseason goes on a little a bit that we see some more intentional just power type run just just to get get a glimpse of how he does when he's got, you know, two hands on the ground and when going right now that you know, a maybe a like a seven techniques and were lined up right across from him, you know some power football or even even Zone run where he's uncovered a maybe launches into the second level to get on Allah line back.	F	Anyway out of Penn State who just did not Do anything and they were hoping if he would have performed you could been a practice squad player, but nevertheless Lots going on here. But look this Titans played a lot of starters Eagles basically didn't play any you know, it really just rested just about everybody so we'll see what they do in week two, but nevertheless there's there were some good stories here that don't let the score full either a lot of good stories in this game.	B	The Eagles did make a trade for Eli Harold they cut or they traded Ryan Bates who probably would have been the first cut if they had to get down to 75 Jeff.

F	That was just taken down in Ontario and I know it's bit dark but like these are things I only hear about in the movies and to think that it's actually happening it like the Kingpin of the sex trafficking ring was in Toronto when they arrested him this happens all the time in in our country and you know, so in my experience in you know, reading about these stories like you're talking about is that people's perception of what sex kicking is versus what it actually is are two different things.

I'm I have no problem having a relationship with the parents, but it really should just be between the coach and the the player and that's that's where it should be and but once again, you know, the parents have been wonderful to me and I don't have any any horror stories to tell about that's good and I think That when you look at how the kids responded when you had crucial victories throughout the year it and even I think in what I looked at one of those photos to it looked as if a dad it's knocked down to the field when your pillow players were celebrating and was right there with a camera to capture every moment of that sounds about right.	B	You can see a shot by shot tracking of the goal being scored and then the celebration that ensued after that and one of the things that I wanted to point out that speaks to you as a coach and the respect those kids and loved those kids have for you is if you get to the end of those those shots where coach partage runs over there to join his team in the Celebration you see kids swarm to him to you know, a coach this is so awesome that kind of thing.

F	You'll have practical theology classes where you're learning how to do deliverance and you'll be learning about pastoral care learning about the nature of the church and talking about inner healing you'll have historical theology classes where you're dealing with the history of the church and three different kind of courses, you'll have courses in Systematic Theology where you'll be dealing with kind of larger themes of Theology of pneumatology the Trinity ecclesiology Etc, and then you'll have This is like we're in right now which are more in exegetical theology which look at specific books of the Bible and then also biblical theology, which is more what we do with in Old Testament and New Testament Theology and I'm always infusing biblical theology into my work because what often happens is if you just do exegetical Theology and you're only asking the question, what did this text mean in its ancient context you haven't made the journey over to the horizon. So if you want to work an exegetical theology, you have to go and you have to learn Hebrew and Aramaic and Luger Riddick and Greek and all these languages because that's the language of the Ian scripture if you're working in Practical theology you have to do that work in scripture, but you also are going to have to do a lot of work in sociology and working over in culture and understanding the world in which were living being like the people of this a car the past who knew the times I studying the times in the Horizon of school of culture.

Is it kind of pulls back the curtain for you and says here are are the tools that you need here are the theological disciplines and thinking and reflection that you need to be able to come up with a school of ministry the way in which the global School of ministry was with started or the school of ministry here at Catch the Fire or the Bethel School of ministry and that there really is you need to have the ability when I call the Evergreen principle to be able to have that core theology so that you can be part of a new generation that will create even more schools of ministry that Sensitive to the Horizon of culture that makes sense.	F	He said an Ethiopia, we really don't have a problem of that God exists. That's what I want to talk about tonight and the other being Systematic Theology.	B	Practical. Theology is giving to you specific tools that can be used right away in Ministry, but also to give you that opportunity to back things up and to and to reflect deeply about the underlying theology behind everything that we do in Ministry and the core theology. And typically the theological the discipline of theology has been divided into kind of several different compartments just it's a way of talking about Theology.	F	Rev.

I still feel that we have not yet made our refineries as sensitive to the The principles of pricing crude oil for processing so I think the host of reforms in the oil sector need to be undertaken and when crude oil prices when low relatively I don't think we were quick enough to take those decisions.	B	Iran is the world's sixth largest producer of oil if in on supplies not going to be available to its many of its consumers like China like India, so there is a global shortfall in the availability of e of crude oil the OPEC which accounts for over 40 percent of the global supplies is already not very keen to increase its output. Hours for Baron already now its impact will be bad and our exports have not been doing very well, although in the March figure shows that it went up almost by ten percent compared to the previous year same page, but we have to look for new sources of supplies Iran also offers us some benefits like it offers a 60-day credit and the quality of the Iranian crude oil is suitable for many of our refineries.	F	We are going to see a long period when Indian economy will have to Stuff that girls impact of high crude oil price, but certainly any crude oil price, which is more than $65 a barrel will have an impact on India's macroeconomic imbalances.

Learn how to squat learn how to Deadlift if you're intimidated by those you can find regressions from them that are simpler and work your way up but focus on the basics and focus on getting better at them focus on the good form like I talked about before the other thing to keep in mind once you get into the gym and have a good plan in place is don't be afraid to make substitutions for your workout.	F	A lot of people may have never even set foot in a gym before and it can be really intimidating but there are things you can do do and the Ways you can approach things that you can actually be successful the first thing to realize that there's millions of people setting New Year's resolutions right now where they already set them but a lot of Statistics show that only like 25 percent of those people actually stick those stick to those goals for even 30 days, which is honestly not that surprising people make unrealistic goals and they just can't stick to them. You have to come to terms with that you're training you're eating better because you love your body and you want to live a long happy successful life not because you absolutely hate where you're at right now and you're just trying to punish yourself from what you were doing in the past.

The biggest thing I see holding people back from even getting started is that they're afraid to go to the gym, they're intimidated by it. You have to be honest with yourself and actually set goals that you can accomplish. It took you 20 30 years of poor habits to get to are you are now.
