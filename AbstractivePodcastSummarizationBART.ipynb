    "#  Abstractive Summarization of Long Podcast Transcripts with BART using Semantic Self-segmentation\n",
    "Podcasts are a rapidly growing medium for news, commentary, entertainment, and learning.  Some podcast shows release new episodes on a regular schedule (daily, weekly, etc); others irregularly.  Some podcast shows feature short episodes of 5 minutes or less touching on one or two topics; others may release 3+ hour long episodes touching on a wide range of topics.  Some are structured as news delivery, some as conversations, some as storytelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a podcast episode, its audio, and transcription, return a short text snippet capturing the most important information in the content. Returned summaries should be grammatical, standalone statement of significantly shorter length than the input episode description.\n",
    "\n",
    "The user task is to provide a short text summary that the user might read when deciding whether to listen to a podcast. Thus the summary should accurately convey the content of the podcast, and be short enough to quickly read on a smartphone screen. It should also be human-readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "For further information about the challenge, take a look to Podcasts Track Guidelines:\n",
    "- [TREC 2020 Podcasts Track](https://trecpodcasts.github.io/participant-instructions-2020.html)"
